Trump Named Man of the Year by ISIS,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Capping an extraordinary 2018, Donald J. Trump announced on Thursday that he had been named Man of the Year by the terrorist organization known as ISIS.
Trump made the announcement after receiving the news from the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whom Trump called “a terrific, fabulous guy.”
“I got along great with him, and he said a lot of nice things about me,” Trump said. “He said ISIS didn’t even consider anyone else.”
Trump, who is expecting to receive an official Man of the Year plaque from ISIS in the next few weeks, said that the award “came as a total surprise to me.”

Cabinet Warns Trump That Shutting Down Government Would Make It Harder to Steal From,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a tense meeting on Monday, leading Cabinet members warned Donald J. Trump that shutting down the federal government would make it exponentially harder for them to steal from.
Led by his Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, the Cabinet members begged Trump to prevent a government showdown that would bring their brazen spree of pillaging the nation’s coffers to a screeching halt.
“Mr. President, with the federal government up and running, I was able to take seven trips on military aircraft at a cost of eight hundred thousand dollars,” Mnuchin said. “I implore you, sir: don’t make me fly coach.”
Trump’s three oldest children, Ivanka, Eric, and Don, Jr., who have piled up impressive taxpayer-funded travel bills of their own, chimed in with an emotional plea to their father. “Daddy, please don’t make us stop plundering government money,” Ivanka said. “Not right before Christmas.”
The normally taciturn Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Ben Carson, also spoke up, warning that a government shutdown would make it impossible for him to accessorize his thirty-one-thousand-dollar dining-room set by purchasing seven-thousand-dollar place mats. “I’d really like those,” he said.
According to Kellyanne Conway, the counsellor to the President, the emotional Cabinet meeting had a profound impact on Trump. “For the first time he saw how a government shutdown would hurt people,” Conway said.",NaN,"December 17, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5c17c5f66e94e94091466ab5/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Trump-Cabinet.jpg",Fake
Trump Suddenly Expresses Deep Concern About Conditions in Nation’s Prisons,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a sudden departure from his previous views on incarceration, Donald J. Trump said on Monday that he was “very, very concerned” about conditions in the nation’s prisons.
“These are very, very bad places,” Trump told reporters. “These are not places you would want to be.”
Trump criticized the “total lack of amenities” in the country’s federal penitentiaries, calling those prisons “a disgrace.”
“If you are locked up in one of those places, there is no TV in your cell,” he said. “And good luck getting a Diet Coke. You can yell and yell and no one will go get you one. It’s a very sad, very sick situation.”
In addition to blasting the conditions inside the nation’s prisons, Trump also questioned whether “putting someone in jail for one or two felonies serves any purpose.”

Trump Names TV Remote New Chief of Staff,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Having been turned down by several previous choices for the job, Donald J. Trump broke with tradition on Monday by picking his television remote to be his new chief of staff.
While some in Washington wondered whether an inanimate object was up to the rigors of working for the mercurial Trump, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, defended the unorthodox selection. “The President and the remote have demonstrated an excellent ability to work together, often for ten or twelve hours a day,” Sanders said.
But even as the White House touted the remote’s qualifications, its tenure as chief of staff appeared to get off to a rocky start on Monday morning.
After the remote got stuck and failed to change the channel when CNN’s Jim Acosta appeared on the television screen, Trump reportedly threw his new chief of staff across the room, narrowly missing Mike Pence’s head.

Speaking to reporters from his home, Kelly said that he had planned the heist of the nation’s nuclear codes with the pinpoint timing of a clandestine military mission.
“I went into the Oval Office on Friday when I knew Trump would be distracted because ‘Fox & Friends’ was on,” he said. “Then, when he started tweeting something that one of the hosts told him to do, I slipped the codes into my pants, as quick as lightning.”
Kelly revealed that, in order to prevent Trump from retrieving the codes, he was keeping them in his pants for safekeeping.

Trump’s choice to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Heather Nauert, said on Friday that a memorable visit to the “It’s a Small World” ride at Disney World made her eminently qualified for the U.N. post.
“When people look at me, they think Heather Nauert, former Fox News anchor,” Nauert told reporters at the State Department. “What they don’t realize is I’m also Heather Nauert, who went on ‘It’s a Small World’ three times when she was nine.”
Nauert said that, while career diplomats might spend twenty to thirty years learning about only one country, “I learned about twenty-five countries in fifteen minutes.”
Laying out her objectives for her tenure at the United Nations, the prospective Ambassador said, “Right now I’m just looking forward to seeing all of the other Ambassadors wearing their festive costumes and doing their dances. That’s going to be amazing, I think.”

Iraq Offers to Help Establish Democracy in North Carolina,"BAGHDAD (The Borowitz Report)—The government of Iraq announced on Tuesday that it would seek to build an international coalition to establish democracy in the state of North Carolina.
Speaking to reporters in Baghdad, the Iraqi President, Barham Salih, said that Iraq had reached out to regional powers including Canada and Mexico to launch a military invasion of North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District to “protect the North Carolinians’ right to self-determination.”
While many in the international community commended Salih’s desire to bring democracy to North Carolina, some critics warned that the effort could wind up destabilizing other American states.
“If North Carolina gets democracy, it’s only a matter of time before the people of Wisconsin, Georgia, and other failed states demand it as well,” Muqtada al-Sadr, the Iraqi politician and cleric, said. “Iraq could find itself in a quagmire with no exit strategy.”

G-20 Leaders Vote Unanimously Not to Give Trump Asylum,"BUENOS AIRES (The Borowitz Report)—In an unusual display of unity by an often fractious organization, the leaders of the G-20 nations voted unanimously on Saturday to deny Donald J. Trump’s urgent request for asylum.
Prior to the vote, Trump had been heard asking colleagues ranging from Angela Merkel to Xi Jinping for safe harbor in their countries, sweetening his request with offers of free luxury penthouses in Trump buildings around the globe.
In the most stunning insult to Trump, his closest allies, Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman, responded to his asylum request by laughing uproariously in his face and high-fiving each other.
After the resolution to deny Trump asylum passed by a 19–0 vote, international observers said that they had never seen the G-20 act with such enthusiastic solidarity. “Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron were practically peeing themselves,” one observer said.

“For weeks, we’ve been hearing national pundits say that Mississippi was ready to enter the twenty-first century,” Hyde-Smith told a crowd of supporters at her victory rally. “Tonight, with your help, we proved them wrong.”
Hyde-Smith said that, despite the media’s unearthing of a cavalcade of embarrassing comments and actions from her past, “I never doubted that, at the end of the day, the people of Mississippi would listen to the racist voices in their heads.”
Choking back tears, Hyde-Smith thanked her supporters for honoring Mississippi’s storied heritage of hatred and cruelty.
“Mississippi voters do not want to tear down the relics of our Confederate past,” she said. “As such a relic, I am eternally grateful.”

Mueller Offers Cyber Monday Plea Deals,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Robert Mueller’s announcement that he would be offering Cyber Monday plea deals touched off hysteria among disgraced Trump associates desperate for the chance to score a drastically reduced sentence.
Moments after the office of the special counsel went live with its Cyber Monday Web site, Sing4Bob.com, thousands of Trump cronies flooded it with traffic, causing the site to briefly crash.
Harland Dorrinson, the member of Mueller’s team who masterminded the Cyber Monday sale, said that the special counsel was offering a limited number of “prison doorbusters,” with sentences up to seventy-five per cent off.
“I’m not surprised that people are going crazy for these bargains,” Dorrinson said. “Otherwise, you could go to trial and face one of those Obama judges.”
He said that Mueller’s Cyber Monday sale was benefitting from a piece of fortuitous timing, since it was being held on the same day that the former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was scheduled to report to prison for a two-week sentence.

Trump Refuses to Pardon White House Turkey After Accusing It of Working for Soros,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a startling break with Thanksgiving tradition, Donald J. Trump refused to pardon the White House turkey after claiming that it was working as a secret operative of the billionaire George Soros.
A group of fourth graders from Bethesda, Maryland, who had gathered on the White House lawn for the annual turkey-pardoning ceremony appeared unprepared for the anti-Soros outburst that Trump unleashed on the Thanksgiving bird.
“That turkey was sent by Soros to spy on me,” Trump said, angrily turning on the fowl. “A lot of people are saying this.”
While the oblivious turkey pecked desultorily at the ground, an increasingly enraged Trump spewed a stream of conspiracy theories linking the feathered animal to global élites, election fraud in Florida, and Jim Acosta.
Trump attempted to lead the fourth-grade class in a chant of “Lock It Up,” apparently directed at the Thanksgiving delicacy, but the students slowly backed away from him in silence.

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said that those in favor of the recount had a “sick obsession with finding out which candidate got the most votes.”
“Democrats are going on and on about counting every last vote until they find out who got the most,” Trump said. “Since when does getting the most votes mean you win?”
Trump said that, if the recounts are allowed to proceed, “We could be looking at a very bad, very sad situation where to be considered legitimately elected you have to get more votes than the other candidate.”

“As Republicans, we have worked tirelessly to intimidate, discourage, and otherwise disenfranchise millions of Florida voters,” a visibly enraged Scott said. “We are not about to let Democrats swoop in at the last minute and ruin all of that fine work.”
Scott angrily singled out the Broward County and Palm Beach County supervisors for their “rampant enforcement of the right to vote.”
“They are literally finding votes by people we are a hundred per cent sure we had scared away from the voting booths,” he said. “This will not stand.”

“The Democrats are responsible for sending this caravan, and, frankly, it’s a disgrace,” he said. “They are sending some dangerous women.”
Elaborating on the threat posed by the caravan, Trump said, “Some of these women have fought in wars. They have fired guns. One of them is a mixed-martial-arts specialist. These are women who will kick your ass without hesitating.”

Midterm Elections Inspire Historic Levels of Early Drinking,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a seismic shift from earlier midterm elections, the 2018 midterms have inspired the highest levels of early drinking in modern history, a new study shows.
According to the study, which was conducted by the University of Minnesota, millions of Americans who would normally start drinking on the night of the midterms took advantage of early drinking and began consuming alcohol days and, in some cases, weeks or months before November 6th.
“We knew that there would be some early drinking, but the magnitude of that drinking is taking even experts by surprise,” Dr. Davis Logsdon, the author of the study, said. “To put it in terms that the layman can understand, we are seeing drinking that is off the Kavanaugh chart.”
Democrats have overwhelmed Republicans in the early drinking tallies, but Logsdon warned against “reading too much into” that disparity.

Trump made his closing argument to the Chattanooga, Tennessee, audience by raising the spectre of a return to the dignified and restrained discourse that plagued the nation during the regime of his predecessor, Barack Obama.

“Do we want our public figures to consider the consequences of their words and actions?” he asked.

He issued a stern warning to the migrants approaching the border, telling them, “The United States military sees your rocks and is raising you paper or scissors.”

Despite the popularity of the caravan, however, there was disagreement over what the optimal number of angry white men to depart with it would be, with some suggesting a figure of twenty thousand and others preferring a number as high as forty million.

"Trump Strips Citizenship from Children of Immigrants, Thus Disqualifying Himself from Presidency","WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Donald J. Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order stripping the children of immigrant mothers of their citizenship, thus disqualifying himself from being President of the United States.
The constitutional crisis came to light moments after the signing ceremony, when a fourth grader visiting the Oval Office on a school tour pointed out the far-reaching legal ramifications of the order.
“Hey, wait, wasn’t your mother from Scotland?” the student, Tracy Klugian, asked. “That means you’re not a citizen and you can’t be President.”

Trump immediately called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh for help in voiding the executive order, but Kavanaugh was unable to take the call because he was “sleeping off a rough night,” an aide to the Justice said.

Trump has dispatched the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, to Saudi Arabia to provide what the White House on Thursday called “essential lying advice and assistance.”
According to the counsellor to the President Kellyanne Conway, “The President was not happy with the quality of lies coming out of the Saudi royal family, and who better to fix that than Sarah Sanders?”
Sources close to Sanders said that the press secretary was “horrified” during her first meeting in Riyadh to discover that the crown prince’s lying skills were “rudimentary at best.”
“The absence of a free press in Saudi Arabia means that M.B.S.”—Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—“has had virtually zero experience lying to reporters,” Sanders reportedly told one of her aides. “The learning curve is going to be steep.”

Putin Furious at Saudis for Using His Puppet Without Permission,"MOSCOW (The Borowitz Report)—The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is “absolutely furious” at the Saudi royal family for using his puppet without first obtaining his permission, an aide to Putin confirmed on Wednesday.
According to the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Russian President has been “seething with anger” in recent days as he has observed the Saudis using his favorite puppet as if it were their own.
“At one point, Putin was watching the news and saw his puppet behaving in the kind of scraping, subservient manner toward the Saudis that he had previously reserved for him,” the aide said. “He pulled the TV out of the wall and hurled it across the room.”
According to diplomatic sources, the Saudis have reached out to Russia in the hopes of striking some sort of puppet-sharing agreement, but the enraged Russian President has refused to entertain such overtures.

"DNA Test Reveals Donald Trump, Jr., Is Fifty Per Cent Idiot","NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—Donald Trump, Jr., has taken a DNA test that reveals that he is “fifty-per-cent idiot,” Trump confirmed on Tuesday.
Speaking to reporters at a press conference in Trump Tower, Trump said that he had undergone the DNA testing “to silence all of the haters who have been saying I’m a total idiot.”
Crowing about the test results, Trump said, “According to this test, I am fifty-per-cent idiot, which is way less than half.”
Trump’s results drew a skeptical response from the scientific community, with many leading geneticists questioning the integrity of his DNA sample.
According to Davis Logsdon, a genetic scientist at the University of Minnesota, “Any test of Don, Jr., that comes back lower than ninety-per-cent idiot is going to set off alarm bells, scientifically speaking.”

Sympathetic Voters Hope to End Melania’s Suffering in 2020,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—One day after Melania Trump pronounced herself “the most bullied person in the world,” millions of American voters vowed to put an end to her suffering in 2020.
In interviews across the country, sympathetic voters promised to do everything in their power to insure that, as of November, 2020, Melania would no longer be the target of the vicious bullying that has made her the most persecuted human on the planet.

Kavanaugh Disappointed to Discover Supreme Court Has No Happy Hour,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a setback for the newest Associate Justice on his first day at work, Brett Kavanaugh said on Tuesday that he was “very disappointed” to learn that the Supreme Court does not have a happy hour.
Kavanaugh told reporters that he made the horrifying discovery as the clock ticked down to 5 P.M. and “everyone was still in their offices working and stuff.”
“I mean, I couldn’t believe it,” Kavanaugh said. “I had been busting my tail for six hours, and I needed to blow off some steam.”
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the member of the Court who delivered the bad news to Kavanaugh. “When she told me, I guess I started crying a bit, which I now regret,” he said. “She just kind of closed her office door and went back to work or whatever.”

Nation’s Criminals Ask for F.B.I. Investigation Kavanaugh Just Got,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In the latest controversy to envelop the Supreme Court nominee, criminals across the United States are demanding that their cases receive the kind of F.B.I. investigation that Brett Kavanaugh just got.
From coast to coast, perpetrators of crimes ranging from arson to bank robbery are arguing that, if the F.B.I. investigates them at all, such investigations should be extremely limited in scope.
Harland Dorrinson, a criminal lawyer in Cleveland, said that his clients have followed the Kavanaugh probe “with great interest” and see it as “tailor-made” for the crimes for which they stand accused.
“My clients are asking that the F.B.I. investigate them for no more than five days and only talk to the witnesses I designate,” Dorrinson said. “We think this could be a huge time saver for everybody.”

“It’s very scary right now to be a man,” Trump said. “You can do or say something that women don’t like, and suddenly millions of women will come out of the woodwork and vote against you. I think it’s a disgrace.”

Twenty Million Witnesses Come Forward Claiming They Saw Kavanaugh Lie Under Oath,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—As the F.B.I. hurries to complete its supplemental background check of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, twenty million witnesses have come forward claiming that they saw Kavanaugh lie under oath.
According to the witnesses, they can remember the place where they saw Kavanaugh lie, a hearing room in the United States Senate, and the exact date and time, this past Thursday afternoon.
Despite the striking similarity of their stories, the twenty million witnesses to Kavanaugh’s mendacity said that they were having trouble getting in touch with the F.B.I., even though lying to the Senate is a federal crime and thus within the Bureau’s jurisdiction.
“I called my local F.B.I. office and was told to call the Bureau’s toll-free tip line,” Harland Dorrinson, a resident of Toledo, Ohio, said. “I did that, but the mailbox for Kavanaugh tips was full.”
Carol Foyler, a Mobile, Alabama, resident who said that she, too, witnessed Kavanaugh lie under oath, expressed frustration at the artificial deadline of the F.B.I.’s probe. “One week is not nearly enough time to interview twenty million people,” she said.
In Washington, Senator Lindsey Graham furiously rejected the witnesses’ version of events, arguing, “This is a classic case of he-said/twenty million said.”

“As he was rattling off all of the people who had victimized him, I was sure I was going to make the list,” Obama said. “It was more than a little deflating that I didn’t.”
Obama said that as Kavanaugh listed such nemeses as the mainstream media, a vast left-wing conspiracy, and the Clintons, he was “on the edge of my chair expecting my name to come up.”
“It’s not a good feeling to be forgotten like that,” he said. “It was a tough thing to watch.”
Obama said that it was “a little comforting” to know that he was not the only person Kavanaugh neglected to blame in his remarks. “I just got off the phone with George Soros, and he is bummed as well,” Obama said.

Republican Party Declares Moral Bankruptcy,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—The Republican Party officially filed for moral bankruptcy on Tuesday morning, a move that many in the nation considered long overdue.
In filing for moral bankruptcy, the Republicans will formally attest that they have no morals, standards, or ethics on their balance sheet, and will agree to cease all activity as a political party in exchange for indemnity from any and all legal actions.
Harland Dorrinson, a Washington attorney who specializes in moral bankruptcies, said that, by making its moral vacuum official, the G.O.P. could theoretically break itself up and sell off the parts, but, he warned, “There are no buyers.”
“From Lindsey Graham to Ted Cruz to Mitch McConnell to Chuck Grassley, all of the Republican Party’s assets could only be described as toxic,” he said. “Their breakup value is zero.”
Further complicating such a sale, Dorrinson said, is the fact that the lion’s share of the Republican Party is already owned by the National Rifle Association, Koch Industries, and the Russian government.
“All of those entities are going to take a major loss on their investment,” he warned. “The Kochs have been trying to sell Paul Ryan for months, and they can’t give him away.”
While bemoaning the demise of a once legitimate political party, Dorrinson did see one silver lining. “The bankruptcy of the Republican Party will be presided over by Donald Trump, and no one has more experience in this area,” he said.",NaN,"September 25, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ba94e17f27f652d85899a79/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Republican-Party-Declares-Moral-Bankruptcy.jpg",Fake
Grassley Spends Weekend Practicing Pretending-to-Listen Face,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Facing the daunting challenge of appearing to pay attention to a woman’s utterances during a televised hearing, Senator Charles Grassley spent the weekend rehearsing what aides are calling his “pretending to listen” face.
In round-the-clock practice sessions that aides characterized as “excruciating,” the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee struggled to simulate even a trace of interest in what a woman had to say.
“Chuck has never pretended to listen to a woman before,” an aide said. “These are uncharted waters.”
According to the aide, Grassley’s fake-listening skills “are rudimentary at best,” and the senator was able to hold only a semi-attentive facial expression for seven seconds before it showed unmistakable signs of boredom, irritation, and contempt.
At one point, Grassley reportedly exploded with frustration, bellowing, “If I’d known that going into politics meant I’d have to listen to women, I’d have become a longshoreman.”

Merrick Garland Admits to Cheating at Scrabble Once,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Saying that “it’s time to face the consequences of my actions,” Judge Merrick Garland admitted on Thursday that he cheated at Scrabble one time, in 2003.
Garland, who recently informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was “still available” to be confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice, choked back tears as he confessed to the “disgraceful” Scrabble incident.
“In late 2003, I was playing a game of Scrabble with my wife and Googled a word while she was off using the bathroom,” Garland said. “I deeply regret my behavior, which was reprehensible and inexcusable.”
Garland revealed that the word he Googled, “muzjiks,” all but sealed his victory in the Scrabble contest.
“Although this was the only time I have ever cheated at any word game, I believe it disqualifies me to sit on the United States Supreme Court,” he said. “Therefore, I hereby withdraw my name from all future consideration.”

In addition to those criticisms, Pence said that the Times insists that writers sign a contract and submit a W-9 before they can get paid.

Nation Stunned That There Is Someone in White House Capable of Writing an Editorial,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Millions of Americans were startled by the revelation on Wednesday afternoon that there was someone working in the Trump White House capable of writing an entire editorial, reports indicate.
In a nation already rocked by a series of bombshells since Labor Day, the news that an anonymous senior White House official had the command of the English language necessary to compose a seemingly coherent Op-Ed piece suitable for publication in a major newspaper was perhaps the most improbable development of all.

The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Trump was convinced that Woodward wrote the book for seventh-grade readers to make its assertions impossible for Trump to refute.
“Trump was turning page after page, becoming increasingly angry at its gratuitous use of a seventh-grade vocabulary,” the aide said. “It was like it was written entirely in a secret code.”
At one point, Trump became so frustrated trying to decipher the word “imbecilic” that he hurled the book across the room.

White Man Hopes to Land Job Without Background Check,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—A fifty-three-year-old white man from Washington, D.C., is hoping to land a six-figure job for life without being subjected to a thorough background check, the man confirmed on Tuesday.
The man, Brett Kavanaugh, said that he was “pretty chill” about his upcoming job interview because he had been assured that “anything super damaging” had been removed from his H.R. file.

Michael Cohen Pleads Guilty After Giuliani Offers to Be His Lawyer,"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—Michael D. Cohen decided on Tuesday to plead guilty to a host of financial crimes shortly after Rudolph Giuliani offered to be his lawyer on a pro-bono basis, Giuliani confirmed.
In an interview with Jake Tapper, on CNN, the former New York City mayor said that he had offered to give Cohen “the kind of defense that only I am capable of giving.”
“The minute I said that, the blood drained from his face and he was out of there like a shot,” Giuliani said. “It was the strangest thing I’d ever seen.”
Giuliani gave CNN viewers a snapshot of what his defense of Cohen would have been like. “I would have said, ‘Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client is guilty,’ ” he said. “ ‘Guilty as sin! But “guilty” rhymes with “not guilty,” and that’s what I’m asking you to find him today.’ I’m telling you, Jake, it would have been a killer.”",NaN,"August 21, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b7c651f568b8e6fb07ed993/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Cohen-Pleads-Guilty-Giuliani.jpg",Fake
Putin Reportedly Close to Firing Giuliani,"MOSCOW (The Borowitz Report)—Vladimir Putin is reportedly “very close” to firing Rudolph Giuliani as Donald J. Trump’s attorney, a source close to the Russian President confirmed on Monday.
According to the source, Putin allowed Trump to hire Giuliani in the first place because “it’s important to let Trump think that he has some autonomy from time to time,” but now the Russian President has apparently determined that “enough is enough.”
Over the next few days, the source indicated, Putin is likely to replace Giuliani with a handpicked successor, Arkady Lubetkin, a criminal-defense attorney who has represented several prominent Russian Mob figures.
After hearing anecdotal reports of Giuliani’s appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Putin initially theorized that the nonsensical nature of Giuliani’s utterances had to be chalked up to “an error in translation,” the source said.
After reading an official transcript of Giuliani’s statements, however, the Russian President was apparently “flabbergasted.”

Pence Stages One-Man Parade in Honor of Trump,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Hours after the Pentagon announced that it would postpone a military parade that Donald J. Trump had requested, Vice-President Mike Pence staged a one-man parade in Trump’s honor.
Explaining his decision to mount the solitary parade, Pence told reporters, “It is the least I can do to pay tribute to the greatness and majesty of Donald Trump, a true American hero.”
Pence acknowledged, however, that marching alone “was a neat way to keep the budget down.”
“Obviously, if money were no object, I would have gone for a little more spectacle,” he said. “Maybe a flyover by Space Force.”
Marching proudly with his chest thrust forward and breaking out into a near-strut, Pence’s parade route took him down Pennsylvania Avenue, where he waved occasionally to confused-looking passersby.
“It was weird seeing him walking all by himself,” Carol Foyler, a tourist who witnessed the Pence parade, said. “I waved back because it was just so sad.”

Trump Says White House Is No Place for Lying Lowlife from Reality Show,"BEDMINSTER, New Jersey (The Borowitz Report)—Blasting his former colleague Omarosa Manigault, Donald J. Trump said on Monday that “the White House is no place for a lying lowlife from a reality show.”
“People were impressed by Omarosa because they saw her on a TV show,” Trump told reporters from his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. “Well, I’ve got news for you: being on a reality show does not qualify you to work in the government.”
Explaining why he considered her a “lowlife,” Trump said, “She’s rude, abrasive, and offensive. Having someone like that in the White House is an embarrassment to our country.”
But worst of all, Trump said, was Omarosa’s lying, which he called “constant.”
“She can’t go a day without lying, and what’s more, she’s narcissistic and paranoid,” he said. “A psycho like that shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the Situation Room.”

Pence Calls Space Force Necessary to Protect U.S. from Gay Aliens,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Making a major announcement at the Pentagon on Thursday, Vice-President Mike Pence said that the proposed United States Space Force was necessary to defend the U.S. from gay aliens.
“I stand before you today to say that this country is under attack from outer-space gays,” Pence told the military gathering. “Only Space Force can protect us from their unimaginable evil.”
Pence detailed a nightmare scenario in which “gay aliens by the thousands” land in the U.S. in “seemingly cute spacecraft” and “subvert life in America as we know it.”
“Let’s say, for example, that these gay aliens can assume human form,” he said. “What’s to stop them from infiltrating normal bakeries and baking cakes for gay weddings?”
“I’ll tell you what’s to stop them,” he said, pausing for dramatic effect. “Space Force.”

Republicans Projected to Pick up Seventy Seats in Prison,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a development that could dramatically change the composition of the federal penitentiary system, Republicans are projected to pick up as many as seventy seats in prison, a leading incarceration expert said on Thursday.
“Prognostication is an inexact science,” Davis Logsdon, who studies conviction rates of corrupt politicians for the University of Minnesota’s Guilt Project, said. “Having said that, if current indictment trends hold up, the Republicans could be flipping at least seventy key prison seats.”
Logsdon broke down criminal cases against Republicans into likely convictions, likely acquittals, and toss-ups, and found that the G.O.P.’s path to the magic number of seventy new prison cells was “very doable.”
According to his projections, Republicans are running for prison “especially well” in districts where the G.O.P. member of Congress was an early supporter of Donald J. Trump.
“In those districts, we’re seeing Republicans who did an incredible job of raising money,” he said. “All of that money is going to translate into a huge number of new freshman prisoners.”
All in all, Logsdon sees the prospect of seventy new Republicans in prison as “nothing short of seismic.”

Republicans Outspent Democrats in Ohio by a Hundred Million Rubles,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (The Borowitz Report)—With Tuesday’s special election in Ohio still too close to call, Republican officials in the state acknowledged that they outspent Democrats to the tune of a hundred million rubles.
Harland Dorrinson, a spokesman for the Ohio Republican Party, told reporters on Wednesday that if the G.O.P. ekes out a win, it will have been worth all of the Russian currency the Party threw at the race.
“You can talk ground game all you want, but, at the end of the day, you can’t buy TV and radio ads without rubles,” he said.
Dorrinson credited the Republican congressional-campaign committee for what he called a “highly successful ruble-raising effort.”
“We were on the phone to oligarchs in our shadowy Kremlin-affiliated donor network up to the last minute,” he said. “Hopefully, it paid off.”
While Ohio Republicans are crossing their fingers that the final election results are in their favor, Dorrinson recognizes that their work is far from over. “We’re going to have a rematch in this district in November, and we don’t want to be caught a day late and a ruble short,” he said.",NaN,"August 8, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b6b11132dc5bf0c1678c759/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-OhioSpecialElection.jpg",Fake
Californians Puzzled by Trump’s Failure to Blame Wildfires on Hillary,"SACRAMENTO, California (The Borowitz Report)—Californians were baffled on Monday by a series of tweets by Donald J. Trump in which he utterly failed to blame the state’s current wildfires on Hillary Clinton.
In interviews with residents up and down the Golden State, Californians agreed with the assessment of Harland Dorrinson, a Modesto native, that Trump’s failure to pin the fires on Clinton was “nothing short of bizarre.”
“When he said that there wasn’t enough water to put out the fires, I naturally assumed he was going to accuse Hillary Clinton of sneaking into California and somehow stealing all of our water,” Dorrinson said. “It was so confusing when he didn’t.”
“I thought that the wildfires would be a perfect opportunity for Trump to accuse Hillary of being anti-water and pro-fire, but he didn’t even mention her,” Tracy Klugian, who lives in San Jose, said. “Maybe he’s really distracted by all this Russia stuff and he’s off his game.”
Carol Foyler, who lives in Monterey, said that Trump’s failure to accuse Hillary Clinton of single-handedly causing the wildfires left her shaken and appalled.

Oliver North Vows to Raise Money for the N.R.A. by Selling Arms to Iran,"FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (The Borowitz Report)—Asserting that “heroic measures” were needed to save the National Rifle Association from financial catastrophe, the N.R.A.’s president, Oliver North, announced plans to sell arms to Iran.
“Iran needs weapons, and, Lord knows, we have a lot of weapons lying around,” North told reporters on Sunday. “This is the definition of a win-win.”
North said that he came up with the idea of selling arms to Iran because “the Iranians were always great to deal with” and “never cared where the money was going to.”
The N.R.A. president said that his next move was to establish new contacts in Iran. “Back in the day, I remember there was an Ayatollah there, but I think it’s a new Ayatollah now,” he said. “I wish I could take a look at my old documents, but I guess I had them shredded.”

Millions of Americans Denied Groceries After Failing to Provide I.D.,"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (The Borowitz Report)—Millions of Americans were foiled in their attempts to purchase groceries on Wednesday after failing to provide the proper government-issued I.D. cards.
From coast to coast, food-seeking scofflaws were turned away from supermarkets, convenience stores, and fruit markets as they tried to circumvent the nation’s long-standing grocery I.D. laws.
“Given that Americans have been required to show I.D. to buy food for years, it’s amazing that people still try to get away with this,” Carol Foyler, a supermarket cashier in Fresno, California, said. “It’s always, ‘Oh, I left my food I.D. in my other pants,’ or some B.S. like that. Believe me, I’ve heard it all.”
In Cleveland, Ohio, a man attempting to buy a loaf of bread, two yogurts, and a bottle of Fanta tried to use another consumer’s food I.D. to make the purchase, but was busted by sharp-eyed security personnel.
“It’s not just people using other people’s food I.D.s to get groceries,” Harland Dorrinson, the store’s security chief, said. “I can’t tell you how many fake food I.D.s we see in here on a daily basis.”
Dorrinson said that, although the nation’s food-I.D. laws have served it well, they “need to go further” to prevent rampant abuses of the system.

Trump Family Flees to Moscow,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Bringing a tumultuous chapter of American history to an abrupt conclusion, Donald J. Trump and three of his adult children fled to Moscow in the early hours of Friday morning.
Accompanied by Ivanka, Eric, and Don, Jr., Trump boarded a specially chartered Aeroflot plane to take him to his new home in Moscow, a nondescript apartment building that also houses the former N.S.A. employee Edward Snowden.
Trump reportedly was in a tremendous hurry to catch the plane and left behind only a one-sentence note, reading, “THERE WAS NO COLUSION [sic].”
At the White House, Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that the Trump family had fled to Moscow, telling reporters, “The Trump family has not fled to Moscow.”
The arrangements for the Trumps’ exit were finalized last week in the one-on-one conversation between Trump and Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki, a translator who was present during the conversation has confirmed.
According to the translator, Trump told Putin, “We’ll move to Moscow as soon as Ivanka winds down her crappy company.”

Republicans Accuse Rosenstein of Secretly Plotting to Uphold Constitution,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—House Republicans on Thursday accused the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, of “secretly and nefariously” implementing a plot to uphold the United States Constitution.

“There is only one way to describe Rosenstein’s obsession with putting the Constitution before all other concerns,” Meadows said. “Conflict of interest.”
“It is almost as if Rod Rosenstein had taken some kind of solemn oath to defend a centuries-old document,” Jordan said. “This should make every American very, very scared.”
Though the Republicans have shelved their articles of impeachment against Rosenstein for now, they hope that their impeachment threat will send a clear message to Rosenstein that his reckless allegiance to the Constitution will no longer be tolerated.

Trump Threatens to Yank Security Clearance from Frederick Douglass,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Donald J. Trump’s crusade to revoke security clearances from perceived critics was on display again on Tuesday as he threatened to yank credentials from a man he had previously praised, Frederick Douglass.
It was unclear why Trump had turned on Douglass, because, unlike other targets of Trump’s security-clearance rampage, Douglass had not made disparaging comments about him on cable news in recent weeks.
Trump offered few clues as to the source of his unhappiness with Douglass, but he broadcast his disapproval of the abolitionist in a tweet that read, “HE IS NO LONGER DOING AN AMAZING JOB.”
The threat to revoke Douglass’s credentials put the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, in a tough spot, because, presumably, Kelly would be the staff member tasked with carrying out such an order.

Trump to Discontinue Obama-Era Practice of Using Lowercase Letters,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Charting a sharply different course from that of his predecessor in the White House, Donald J. Trump announced on Monday that he would discontinue the Obama-era practice of using lowercase letters.

“I WILL KEEP AMERICA STRONG BY USING ALL CAPS,” he tweeted. “THERE ARE NO SMALL LETTERS IN USA!”
“LITTLE LETTERS BAD!!!” Trump added, for emphasis.
Trump’s policy of zero tolerance for lowercase letters could have a sweeping impact on the federal bureaucracy if, as rumored, all government agencies are required to retrofit their computers and mobile devices with a permanent caps-lock key.
Additionally, civil-liberties groups argued that Trump’s war on lowercase letters flies in the face of the First Amendment, which implicitly protects the right to use letters of all sizes and fonts.

Trump asserted that playing the Russian anthem was a “necessary gesture of good will from the USA to our No. 1 ally,” and that “any player who refuses to stand for the Russian antem [sic] hates America!”
Seeming to double down on his demand, Trump tweeted that all N.F.L. players must remain standing while the color guard unfurls the flag of the Russian Federation.
Trump’s insistence that football players stand for the Russian anthem appeared to come as a surprise to the director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, who first heard about it while appearing at a security forum, in Bethesda, Maryland.

Leaders of ISIS and Al Qaeda Puzzled Why Trump Has Not Invited Them to White House,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—The leaders of ISIS and Al Qaeda said on Friday that they were totally perplexed as to why Donald J. Trump had not yet invited them to the White House.

“Maybe we haven’t done anything to directly undermine their democracy—I get that,” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, said.  “But we’ve been nemeses of America for years, and that ought to be worth something.”

Calling the absence of a White House invitation for Al Qaeda “the height of unfairness,” the evildoer added, bitterly, “The whole thing seems political.”

Kavanaugh’s essay, which was distributed to the press shortly after he was announced as the winner, reads as follows: “Donald J.

China Slaps Two-Thousand-Per-Cent Tariff on Tanning Beds,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In the latest salvo in its escalating trade war with the United States, China has slapped all tanning beds slated for export to the U.S. with a two-thousand-per-cent tariff.
By artificially hiking up the cost of its tanning beds, China succeeded in sending the price of tanning beds worldwide soaring in overnight markets.
In what some experts regarded as a related move, China also placed a four-thousand-per-cent tariff on all spray-tan products headed for the U.S., as well as instant-tanning lotions, makeup foundation, and several popular hues of orange paint, including butter rum and burnt sienna.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, blasted China’s tariffs on its full range of tanning products, calling the move an “act of war.”
“What China doesn’t understand is that it is far from the only player in the tanning game,” Sanders said. “The United States stands ready and willing to import tanning beds from our friends in Canada.”
In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded to reporters’ questions about the prospect of Canada shipping tanning beds to the United States. “It doesn’t look good,” he said.",NaN,"July 9, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b436dbfac6a9b25634931a4/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-ChinaTaxesTanning.jpg",Fake
Foreigners Unsure Why Anyone Would Want to Travel to U.S. at This Point,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Shortly after the United States Supreme Court upheld Donald J. Trump’s controversial travel ban, millions of people from other countries expressed puzzlement that anyone would want to travel to the United States at this juncture.
In interviews with people from around the world, respondents said that the travel ban struck them as unnecessary, because the United States was not currently on the list of the top hundred countries to which they would consider travelling.
When asked to name the reasons they felt that a travel ban was superfluous, many of those interviewed cited the United States’s gun violence and crumbling infrastructure, as well as its broken educational and health-care systems, while others singled out its President’s startling disrespect for democratic norms and human rights.
Given those views, most of the foreigners interviewed said they found the news of the Supreme Court’s decision baffling. “When I heard that the United States was having a travel ban, I assumed that was to keep people from leaving,” one respondent said, echoing the sentiments of many.",NaN,"June 26, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b32662d8ffba43192e8368e/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-SCTravelBan.jpg",Fake
Trump Agrees to Let Kim Jong Un Have Pence as Manservant,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—As new details emerge from this week’s summit in Singapore, the White House has confirmed that Donald J. Trump unilaterally offered to let Kim Jong Un have Mike Pence as his personal manservant.
The offer reportedly came after Kim spoke glowingly to Trump about the Vice-President’s obsequiousness, sources said.
“Even by North Korean standards, Pence puts my toadies to shame,” Kim reportedly said.
Once the necessary paperwork is squared away, Pence could begin bowing and scraping in Pyongyang as early as next week.
Going forward, Pence’s duties as senior sycophant to Trump are expected to be performed by Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.

Kim Jong Un Offers to Host Peace Talks Between United States and Canada,"SINGAPORE (The Borowitz Report)—One day before his summit with Donald J. Trump, the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un, has offered to host peace talks between the United States and Canada.
Speaking to reporters at his hotel in Singapore, Kim said that the rising tensions between the North American neighbors were posing an “intolerable threat to world peace.”
In addition to offering to host U.S.-Canada talks in Pyongyang, Kim urged the immediate creation of a demilitarized zone along the border separating the two hostile nations.
“In exchange for Canadian Mounties agreeing to stand down on their side of the border, the United States, in turn, would dismantle its nuclear weapons,” Kim said.
Although stating that “North Korea stands ready and willing to be an honest broker” in peace talks between the two countries, he urged Trump to dial back the “inflammatory rhetoric” that he aimed at Canadians over the weekend.

Speaking to reporters, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau said that there had been “total consensus” among non-U.S. participants to withhold information about the time, place, and existence of an after party from Trump.
“The plan was, if Trump asked about an after party, we were going to be, like, ‘Ask Angela Merkel,’ ” Macron said. “Angela was going to totally stonewall him.”
Merkel confirmed that she had planned to tell Trump that she “didn’t think anyone was planning to do anything” after the summit and steadfastly to deny “hearing anything” about an after party.
“I would have had no problem lying to him, despite our two countries going way back, to D-Day or whenever,” Merkel said, rolling her eyes.

"Schools Cancel White House Tours, Fearing That Trump Might Teach Kids History","WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Schools across the country have cancelled tours of the White House out of concern that a chance encounter with Donald J.

In an advisory sent to the nation’s schools on Thursday, the American Educators Consortium urged teachers to scrap all scheduled trips to the White House in order “to prevent the hard work you and your students have been doing from being totally undone.”
Carol Foyler, a middle-school history teacher from Bethesda, Maryland, spoke of a “scary moment” during a White House tour last week when her class had a “near-miss” with Trump.
“We were walking by the Oval Office, the door was open, and I could see he was in there,” the educator said. “I just said to my kids, ‘Keep your heads down and walk fast.’ ”

Trump’s Lawyers Argue That He Cannot Be Impeached Because He Was Never Actually Elected,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In what they believe is a legal masterstroke, lawyers for Donald J. Trump are now claiming that he cannot be impeached because he was never actually elected.
In a lengthy memo sent to the special counsel, Robert Mueller, the lawyers pushed back vehemently against any allegation that Trump was legally elected President.
“Because Russian interference made the election of Donald J. Trump wholly illegitimate, any attempt to remove him from an office that he does not legally hold is clearly impossible,” the memo asserted.
The memo claimed that the Constitution contains “no provision for removing a person from office when that person was installed there by a foreign power.”
The memo went on to argue that, if a subpoena is sent to the White House, it will be returned to Mueller and stamped “addressee unknown.”
“A person referred to in a subpoena as ‘President’ Donald J. Trump simply does not exist,” the memo claimed.

After signing pardon after pardon while Pence looked on intently, Trump commanded the Vice-President to sign a “practice pardon” to prove that he “wouldn’t mess anything up,” the source said.
Before trying his hand at issuing a pardon, Pence heaped praise on Trump for the pardoning demonstration he had just given.

He also said that Mexico would pay for a wall on its border with the U.S., a claim that he has repeatedly made while under the influence of Ambien.

“We’ve been living under assumption that a TV personality could tweet out as many racist things as he or she wanted with no consequences,” the source said. “Now, all of a sudden, our worst nightmare has come true.”
White House staffers are reportedly combing through Trump’s thirty-seven thousand tweets, searching for ones that could be deemed fireable offenses, and have so far flagged more than thirty-six thousand of them.

Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the National Football League, said that, by adding the First Amendment to the list of banned substances, the N.F.L was establishing a “policy of zero tolerance on tolerance.”
In order to enforce the ban, Goodell said that players would be tested periodically to determine whether they had used words, gestures, or facial expressions that are strictly prohibited under the new rule.

“I’ve been trying to figure out who would have the opportunity and the motive to do something like this,” he said. “But I keep coming up empty.”
“Opportunity-wise, you’d need to be someone who’s in my inner circle and who could get close to me without raising suspicions,” he said. “But, then again, the person would have to be able to suddenly disappear for periods of time and report back to the F.B.I.

In interviews across the country, Americans expressed dismay and, in some cases, despair at the news that F.B.I. infiltrators might have had a golden opportunity to prevent the nation’s current unspeakable nightmare from unfolding but did not get the job done.

“I’ve seen a lot of bad deals in my life, but this Constitution is a total mess,” he said. “We need to tear it up and start over.”
Trump was scathing in his remarks about the two-hundred-and-twenty-nine-year-old document, singling out for special scorn its insistence on three branches of government. “The branches thing is maybe the worst part of this deal,” he said. “The first thing we do when we pull out of the Constitution is get rid of two of those branches.”
He also called the First Amendment “something that really has to go.”
“No one in his right mind would put something like that in a Constitution,” he said. “Russia doesn’t have it. North Korea doesn’t have it. All the best countries don’t have it.”
He stopped short of accusing his predecessor, Barack Obama, of writing the United States Constitution, but said, “He’s working hard behind the scenes trying to save it, because he knows that the Constitution is very, very bad for me.”
Vowing to replace the Constitution with “a new, much, much better Constitution,” he acknowledged that there might be some elements of the original document worth salvaging. “We’re going to keep the Second Amendment,” he said, “and definitely the Fifth.”",NaN,"May 9, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5af3198f79ac2527a3cee2fa/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Trump-Constitution.jpg",Fake

Mueller Reportedly Considering Appropriate Thank-You Gift for Giuliani,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is actively considering what would be the most appropriate thank-you gift to send to the former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a source close to Mueller’s team has confirmed.
According to the source, Mueller and his team were behind closed doors on Thursday morning to discuss the gift and appear to be close to a decision.

Responding to Avenatti’s comments, federal prosecutors investigating Michael Cohen issued a statement asserting that they had, in fact, sent Giuliani an entire case of champagne last night, which would appear to leave caviar as Mueller’s only remaining gift option.

Mueller Says That Until Yesterday He Had Almost Forgotten to Investigate Giuliani,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—The independent counsel, Robert Mueller, told reporters that, prior to news reports on Thursday, he had “almost forgotten” to investigate the former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
“Like most Americans, I had totally forgotten about Rudy Giuliani’s existence,” he said. “But then when he popped up on the news I was, like, ‘Hold on—shouldn’t we be investigating him?’ ”
Mueller was at a loss to explain why he had failed to investigate Giuliani earlier. “I have no idea how it could have slipped my mind,” he said. “His role in Trump’s campaign was as fishy as all get-out.”
He said that other members of his team were “poking fun” at him for not deciding to investigate Giuliani before Thursday. “I mean, think about it: how do you do a criminal investigation of the Trump campaign and leave Rudy out of it?” he said. “I’ve got to say, I’m pretty darn embarrassed about the whole thing.”
When asked for an estimate of when the Russia inquiry might wrap up, Mueller responded, “I honestly can’t say. I was hoping to bring it to a close in the next month or two, but now that we’re also investigating Rudy Giuliani, God only knows how long it’ll take.”",NaN,"April 20, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ad9ff7125e5f9763807cdd7/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Mueller-Reaction-to-Giuliani.jpg",Fake
Trump Hires Only Lawyer in U.S. with Fewer Clients Than Michael Cohen,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—The White House announced on Thursday that Donald Trump had successfully secured the services of Rudolph Giuliani, after an exhaustive search for an attorney with fewer clients than Michael D. Cohen.
“President Trump had become concerned in recent days that Mr. Cohen might be too distracted to pay full attention to his case, what with him having two other clients and all,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said. “So the search was on for a lawyer with zero clients, and with the hiring of Mayor Giuliani, the President believes he has hit the jackpot.”
Speaking to reporters, Giuliani agreed that, by virtue of having three fewer clients than Cohen, he was uniquely qualified to give Trump his full attention. “There is absolutely no chance of my ever putting him on hold,” Giuliani said.
While the former New York mayor’s hiring got high marks from Trump’s inner circle, it drew a bitter reaction from Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, who angrily pointed out that he had not been considered for the job despite having as few clients as Giuliani. “Not only do I have absolutely no clients, I have even less going on, career-wise, than Rudy Giuliani,” Christie said. “Once again, I’ve been screwed.”",NaN,"April 20, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ad94d169b71e202750265c1/master/w_727,c_limit/borowitz-Rudy-Giuliani.jpg",Fake
Nation Shocked to Learn of Possible Bias at Fox News,"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—Millions of Americans were stunned and incredulous on Monday after learning of a possible incident of bias at Fox News Channel.
At a time when so many American institutions have been under attack, the possibility that Fox, one of the nation’s most respected news organizations, might be susceptible to hidden agendas was too much for many to take.
In interviews across the country, Fox viewers expressed disappointment, confusion, and shock that a news network known for its exacting standards had imperilled its hard-earned reputation for fairness.
“I’m devastated by this,” Carol Foyler, a viewer from Scottsdale,  Arizona, said. “If we can’t trust Fox News, who can we trust?”
Tracy Klugian, a viewer from Akron, Ohio, said that he had been “walking around in a state of disbelief” since he learned of possible bias at the network. “I’m trying to be strong, but it’s tough,” he said. “I know I speak for a lot of people when I say that today was the day that America lost its innocence.”
But some Fox viewers, like Harland Dorrinson, of Topeka, Kansas, warned of a “rush to judgment” against Fox, urging people to remember the network’s stellar record of journalistic accomplishments.
“Whenever there was a national emergency, whether it was Benghazi, Hillary’s e-mails, or Obama’s birth certificate, Fox News was there,” he said. “One little mistake doesn’t wash all that away.”",NaN,"April 17, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ad60f3351fedf7258aa43a3/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Fox-News-Bias-Hannity.jpg",Fake
Hannity Says He Totally Forgot Michael Cohen Was His Lawyer When He Criticized F.B.I. Raid On His Office,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—One week after lambasting the F.B.I.’s raid on Michael D. Cohen’s office as a “fishing expedition,” Sean Hannity said that he “totally forgot,” when he made those comments, that Michael D. Cohen was his lawyer.
“When I called the raid on Michael D. Cohen’s office a ‘fishing expedition’ last week, it completely slipped my mind that my lawyer is, in fact, Michael D. Cohen,” the Fox News host told his viewers. “My bad.”
“If I had remembered at the time that Michael D. Cohen was my lawyer, and that some of the documents that were seized most likely involve me, I would of course have mentioned those things on the air,” he said. “But honestly, the name ‘Michael D. Cohen,’ and the address of his office, just did not ring a bell.”
Hannity said that his wife would “have a field day” with his forgetting Michael D. Cohen’s name, because she always teases him for “having a brain like a sieve.”
“I’m always forgetting things,” he said. “My phone password. My keys. The name of my lawyer who did private stuff for me. That’s old Sean for you. I’m hopeless.”
In closing, he said that his newly uncovered connection to the F.B.I. investigation would “in no way” affect his coverage of the probe.
“I promise you, my viewers, that I will be fair and balanced, even though my lawyer is—what’s his name again?” Hannity said. “I had it on the tip of my tongue.”",NaN,"April 16, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ad505f73230086f4a5fa2b9/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Hannity-Cohen.jpg",Fake
Melania Says Comey’s Book Not as Mean as the One She Is Writing,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Melania Trump said on Monday that she did not understand the controversy swirling around James Comey’s new memoir, because the book she is writing is “so much meaner.”
Speaking to reporters at the White House, she said that she had obtained an advance copy of Comey’s book because she “couldn’t wait to read it,” but said that she found its tone and contents disappointingly mild.
“It felt like he was pulling his punches,” she said. “No one will say that when they read my book.”
She said that, as a fellow-author, she had sympathy for Comey. “Clearly, he was trying very hard to be nasty, and he deserves credit for effort,” she said. “But I will show him how it is done.”

Amazon Apologizes for Shipping Ten Thousand Copies of Comey’s Book to White House,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Calling it a “regrettable accident,” Amazon apologized on Thursday for shipping ten thousand advance copies of James Comey’s book, “A Higher Loyalty,” to the White House.
Cartons of the book arrived early Thursday morning and kept coming throughout the day, until stacks of the book clogged virtually every hallway and office in the building.
Reportedly, Donald J. Trump was so incensed by the book situation that he screamed at Mike Pence while the Vice-President was in the middle of praising him, one source said.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called any speculation that Trump had ordered Comey’s book “absurd,” adding, “The President does not order reading material.”
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, said that he had “absolutely no idea” how the ten thousand Comey books made their way to the White House, but advised Trump to follow the procedures on the Amazon Web site for returning unwanted merchandise.
“You can print up the return labels at home,” he said. “The books should be picked up and out of there in two weeks, three weeks, max.”
Bezos said that shipping the ten thousand books back to the company’s warehouse would not be overly costly for Amazon. “We get an amazing deal on postage,” he said.",NaN,"April 12, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5acfdc79b9cbf97aec951e30/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Comey-sends-book-to-Whitehouse.jpg",Fake
Furious Koch Brothers Sell Paul Ryan on eBay,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a fit of pique, David and Charles Koch have unceremoniously listed House Speaker Paul Ryan for sale on the auction site eBay.
The Kochs, who reportedly had purchased Ryan for a sum estimated in the tens of millions, now seem likely to lose their entire investment.
According to Ryan’s listing on the auction site, the Kochs set a five-hundred-dollar asking price for the used congressman, a figure that, in light of the tepid bidding for him, seems optimistic.
“Granted, owning Paul Ryan doesn’t have the benefits that it’s had for David and Charles for all of these years, but the status of owning a former Speaker of the House has to be worth something,” one Koch associate said. “Certainly more than the current high bid of seventeen dollars.”

Trump Sends National Guard to His Accountant’s Office,"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—In what some experts are calling an unprecedented use of military force, Donald J. Trump on Tuesday ordered four thousand National Guard troops to protect the midtown Manhattan offices of his accountant.
According to those familiar with the National Guard’s deployment, the troops will secure the corridors and elevator banks in the vicinity of the accounting firm that prepares Trump’s taxes.
The troops, whose mission is being called Operation Safe Returns, are expected to arrive on Wednesday, after making the two-thousand-mile journey from the Mexican border.
At the White House, Trump defended his decision to use the nation’s military to protect his accountant’s offices. “Yesterday our country was attacked,” he said. “Never again.”
Trump’s unilateral decision to invade Manhattan drew a muted response in diplomatic circles around the world, with many allies taking a cautious “wait and see” attitude.

“The U.S. military is the mightiest force in all the world,” Hannity said. “However we decide that President Trump will use that force in Syria, we promise that it will be a decision he will be proud of.”
Pirro said that she and her colleagues were taking “full advantage of the entire Fox News brain trust” to craft Trump’s Syria response. “The American people should sleep well at night knowing that we are keeping Tucker Carlson in the loop,” she said.

Peña Nieto displayed several photographs showing prototypes of therapists, including a bearded Freudian analyst who he said came highly recommended.
While some Mexican taxpayers argued that a full course of psychiatric treatment could prove more costly than a border wall, Peña Nieto warned against skimping on such a necessary expense.

Scott Walker Dismayed That Wisconsin Apparently Smarter Despite Cuts in Education,"MADISON (The Borowitz Report)—Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, said on Wednesday that he was “dismayed and alarmed” that people in his state had somehow become smarter despite substantial cuts in education.
“Ever since I took office, I have slashed education with the goal of making the voters of this state markedly dumber and incapable of critical thinking,” he told reporters. “Instead, what I am looking at is a doomsday scenario.”
Walker said that his cuts were based on a theory known as “trickle-up stupidity,” in which students in Wisconsin’s schools would become less informed and their ignorance would eventually infect their voting-age parents.
“Clearly, what looked like a can’t-miss plan on paper has not panned out,” he said.

Sinclair TV Anchor Suddenly Begins Reading News in Russian,"AKRON, OHIO (The Borowitz Report)—Viewers of the Sinclair station in Akron were startled on Monday when a longtime news anchor, Carol Foyler, inexplicably began reading the evening news report in Russian.
Foyler, who is not of Russian heritage, greeted her audience with a hearty “Zdravstvuyte,” and then read the evening’s top stories entirely in her newly adopted language.
After racing through the local coverage, Foyler abruptly segued to footage of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, admiring the launch of his nation’s highly touted new Satan-2 missile.
Viewers flooded the station with complaints, with many expressing alarm that, in the words of one audience member, “something was up with Carol.”

Fired Trump Staffers Hold Reunion,"HOUSTON (The Borowitz Report)—Former White House staffers who were fired by Donald Trump held their first reunion on Easter Sunday in Houston’s Astrodome.
The event, which drew a crowd of approximately sixty-five thousand people, had been organized by the recently axed Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson.
“The turnout is just outstanding,” a beaming Tillerson told reporters. “Of course, most of these people didn’t have anything else to do.”
The reunion was a veritable Who’s Who of dismissed Trump staffers, with such luminaries as Anthony Scaramucci, Sean Spicer, H. R. McMaster, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon spotted side by side at a make-your-own-taco station.
While the event ran smoothly for the most part, there was one minor hiccup when David Shulkin, the former Secretary of Veterans Affairs, was briefly denied entry until he could prove that he had actually been fired rather than having resigned.
“We made it very clear from the outset that this party was for fired staffers only,” Tillerson said. “But once David walked us through exactly how he got canned we were, like, O.K., you can come in.”

Putin had high praise for the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who, he said, “managed to win in a district that I easily delivered to Donald Trump in 2016.”

House Republicans Say Japanese Did Not Meddle in Pearl Harbor,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Reaching the opposite conclusion of many of their committee peers, Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday that the Japanese did not meddle in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
“After an exhaustive investigation, we have come to the conclusion that there was no attempt by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service to influence the outcome of Pearl Harbor,” Rep.

Conaway said that while there were Japanese bombers in the vicinity of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, their role in the attack there has been “blown out of proportion.”
“Is it possible that some of their planes were flying in places they shouldn’t have flown and dropping some things that they shouldn’t have dropped, by accident?” Conaway said. “Absolutely. Does that prove that there was intent to meddle in Pearl Harbor? Absolutely not.”

Kim Jong Un Reveals He Is Just Using Trump to Meet Stormy Daniels,"PYONGYANG (The Borowitz Report)—Kim Jong Un has revealed to close associates that he has offered to meet Donald J. Trump only as a means of achieving his real goal: meeting the former adult-film star Stormy Daniels.
A confidant of the North Korean dictator said that Kim revealed his true intentions behind the Trump invitation at a high-level government meeting on Thursday night. “Kim said that he was a big fan of Stormy’s, and he decided that meeting with Trump would be a ‘necessary evil’ if he wanted a chance to meet her,” the confidant said.
According to the confidant, Kim first attempted to arrange a meeting with Daniels through his close friend, the former N.B.A. player Dennis Rodman, “but, when Dennis said that he didn’t know Stormy, Kim was, like, ‘Oh, well, I guess I’ll have to go through Trump, then.’ ”

Kushner Close to Obtaining Clearance for Other Government Facility,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Just days after losing his top security clearance at the White House, Jared Kushner could soon be eligible to enter another high-security government facility, legal experts believe.
According to Davis Logsdon, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, Kushner could be on the verge of obtaining “long-term clearance” at this separate facility, which, like the White House, is owned and operated by the federal government.
Logsdon said that, although such a facility lacks some of the prestige of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Kushner would have access to government benefits there that far exceed what he has received as an unpaid adviser at the White House.
“All of his meals and housing would be fully paid for by the taxpayer,” Logsdon said. “And, if things play out the way some believe they will, Jared Kushner could be receiving these benefits for decades to come.”
While gaining entry to another government facility so soon after losing security clearance at the White House would represent an extraordinary comeback for Kushner, it would not come without a price, the law professor warned.

Whenever Kushner was away on business trips to the United Arab Emirates, China, or other foreign countries, other members of the White House staff would try to fill in for him at bedtime, but Trump would always petulantly reject them.
“He’d be, like, ‘You’re no good. I want Jared,’ ” the aide said.
According to the aide, Kushner had a “special way” of reading classified documents to Trump, “very slowly and leaving out any long words.”
“He’d read in kind of a high, whispery voice that the President found soothing,” the aide said. “Within seconds, he was fast asleep.”",NaN,"February 28, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a96cc767b7f7c0abc45917f/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Trump-Kushner.jpg",Fake
Trump Hides Under Desk After Diet Coke Can Opens Loudly,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a moment of high drama at the White House on Tuesday morning, Donald J. Trump dove under his desk after a can of Diet Coke opened with an unexpectedly loud sound.
Moments earlier, Trump had pressed a button on his desk, summoning Vice-President Mike Pence to the Oval Office to serve him the frosty beverage.
According to one aide, when Pence opened the can, it made “an unusually loud noise,” sending Trump ducking under his desk in a millisecond.
At a news conference, minutes later, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, attempted to tamp down speculation that Trump had acted in a cowardly manner during the Diet Coke incident. “The President prudently repositioned himself under his desk in an aggressive crouch,” she said. “He was ready for anything.”
Pence agreed with her assessment. “The President was putting himself in a position where, if need be, he could defend the entire country against an attack,” he said. “I, for one, am honored to serve a man of such valor.”
The White House physician, Ronny Jackson, also had high praise for Trump. “He has the ability to flee a loud noise of a man half his age,” the doctor said.",NaN,"February 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a9586a12c02a1185ef9a6e8/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Close-Call-for-Trump.jpg",Fake
Trump Orders Parade to Celebrate His Hypothetical Act of Heroism in Florida School,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Shortly after he declared that he would have run into a Florida high school unarmed to thwart a mass shooting, Donald J. Trump announced that he was planning a parade in Washington, D.C., to celebrate his hypothetical act of heroism.
“Anyone can act with bravery in the moment,” Trump told reporters in the White House. “But it takes a very special kind of hero to tell people about the incredibly brave thing he would have done weeks after the thing happened.”
He added that it was one of his greatest regrets that bone spurs prevented him from serving in the Vietnam War, “because the really courageous things I would have done during that war would have been off the charts.”
“As soon as the Tet Offensive happened, I would have run unarmed right into that mess,” he said. “We probably would have won the war right after I did that.”
Trump said that the parade he was ordering would honor not only him but all of America’s “last responders.”

Trump Furious After Twitter’s Bot Purge Leaves Him with Fourteen Followers,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Donald J. Trump was reportedly “furious” on Wednesday morning after a purge of right-wing bots by Twitter left him with a total of fourteen remaining followers, aides have confirmed.
Rising at 3 A.M. to engage in one of his trademark early-morning tweetstorms, Trump was incensed to discover that his Twitter following had plummeted from more than forty-eight million to a little more than a dozen.
At Twitter headquarters, in San Francisco, a company spokesman confirmed that Trump had indeed lost 48,076,920 followers in the bot purge. “It turned out that over forty-six million of the President’s followers came from a single troll farm in Macedonia,” the spokesman said.
As of Wednesday, Trump’s fourteen remaining Twitter followers included his daughter Ivanka; his sons Eric and Donald, Jr.; several White House aides; and someone named Heinrich Himmler III.

"Millions of Americans Demand $130,000 for Not Having Sex with Trump","WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Millions of Americans on Wednesday demanded that Donald J. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, issue them checks in the amount of $130,000 for not having sex with Trump.
After Cohen revealed that he had issued such a check to Stormy Daniels, a porn star who he claims never had intimate relations with his client, there was widespread outrage among other Americans who had also not had sex with Trump but had not been paid for not doing so.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy for Stormy Daniels,” Tracy Klugian, a florist in Santa Rosa, California, said. “I just want my check, too.”
Harland Dorrinson, a bank teller in Akron, Ohio, said that he had already e-mailed Cohen to demand payment. “I have never come close to having sex with Trump, and that should be worth something,” he said. “Specifically, $130,000.”

Nation Cruelly Reminded That It Once Had a President,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In a televised event that many deemed unnecessarily cruel, millions of Americans were briefly reminded on Monday that they once had a President.
Unsuspecting Americans who turned on cable news Monday morning were suddenly assaulted with the memory of a time when the country’s domestic affairs, international diplomacy, and nuclear codes were entrusted to an adult.
CNN, one of the networks that televised the event, immediately said that it regretted doing so, and acknowledged that reminding Americans that they recently had a President had caused widespread bereavement and distress. “CNN deeply apologizes for the error,” a network statement read. “It will never happen again.”
Compounding the cruelty of the televised event, the networks lingered unnecessarily on a speech that only served to remind viewers that the nation once had a President who rigorously obeyed rules of grammar and diction.
Finally, the reminder that the country recently had a chief executive who loved and respected his wife was deemed “too much” by many viewers, who felt compelled to change the channel.

Trump Gives Wife Beater Praise He Usually Reserves for Child Molesters and Nazis,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—In comments to reporters at the White House on Friday, Donald J. Trump stirred controversy by lavishing an alleged wife beater with praise that he historically has reserved for child molesters and Nazis.
Reporters who heard the President’s comments were taken aback since, in the past, the President had given no indication that he held wife beaters in the same high esteem in which he holds supporters of child abuse and white supremacy.
“We knew that President Trump considered child molesters and Nazis very fine people, but this was the first time he had put wife beaters up there, too,” Tracy Klugian, a member of the White House press corps, said. “We wanted clarification as to whether he considered wife beaters as fine as those other two groups, or finer.”
John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, accused reporters of attempting to drive a wedge between three of the President’s most cherished constituencies.

Kim Jong Un Taunts Trump with Photo of Hair Withstanding Gale-Force Wind,"PYONGYANG (The Borowitz Report)—In a week when Donald J.

The photo showed a broadly smiling Kim, his hair seemingly unperturbed by what the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) claimed were winds gusting up to fifty miles per hour.
According to KCNA’s news release, “Dear Leader’s mighty wind-resistant raven mane easily overmatches the American dotard’s sparse bleached strands.”
Perhaps in response to Kim’s taunt, the White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, held a hastily scheduled press conference to give an upbeat assessment of Trump’s hair.

"Military Refuses to Participate in Trump’s Parade, Citing Bone Spurs","WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—The Pentagon has turned down Donald J.

Harland Dorrinson, a Pentagon spokesman, said that, within an hour of Trump’s request, more than a hundred thousand military personnel complained that they were suffering from acute cases of bone spurs that would make marching in such a parade a painful ordeal.
“In the history of the U.S. military, we have never experienced a bone-spur epidemic of this magnitude,” the spokesman said. “Regrettably, however, we have no choice but to issue thousands of deferments.”
A statement from the bone-spur sufferers said that they would continue to valiantly serve their country around the world in a non-marching capacity, and offered an alternative to their participation in Trump’s proposed pageant.

"Under Pressure from Fox News, Obama to Stop Making Stocks Plummet","NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—One day after the Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity blamed him for the historic plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, former President Barack Obama agreed to stop making stocks tumble.
“Sean Hannity has accused me of making the stock market go down,” Obama told reporters on Tuesday morning. “All I have to say is, ‘Guilty as charged.’ ”
A visibly chastened Obama said that, at first, he thought that he had gotten away with making the stock market crash, but when he saw Hannity blame him on Fox, “I knew I had been busted.”
Obama offered scant explanation for why he had made stocks crash on Monday. “I guess since leaving the White House I haven’t really found enough ways to fill my time, so tanking the stock market seemed like something to do,” he said. “But I know that’s not a good excuse.

“Increasingly, the President has become convinced that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is not on his team,” one aide said. “Seeing the negative Dow numbers in the corner of the TV screen has been wrecking eleven hours of every day for him.”
Reportedly, Trump is mulling replacing the Dow with a new system, in which Sarah Huckabee Sanders would appear every day at 4 P.M. to announce how high stocks had skyrocketed.

Former Hippies Put in Horrible Position of Rooting for F.B.I.,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Former hippies across the United States have been put in the unbearable position of rooting for the F.B.I., hippies have confirmed.
From Vermont to California, erstwhile hippies bemoaned a nightmare
scenario that has forced them to side with a law-enforcement agency
they have despised since the Summer of Love.
“I always dreamed I’d spend my retirement surrounded by my
grandchildren, telling them that the F.B.I. were fascist pigs,” Carol
Foyler, a former hippie who lives in Santa Cruz, said. “That dream has
been shot to hell.”
Her husband, Mick, nodded his head in sad agreement. “We were so happy
when pot was legalized in California,” he said. “But the fact that we’re
now on the same side as the F.B.I. has ruined even that.”
Now in their seventies, the Foylers are spending their days doing things
they never dreamed possible when they traipsed through the mud at
Woodstock: going door to door in Santa Cruz, asking other former freaks
to sign a pro-F.B.I. petition.
“Donald Trump has wrecked America’s standing around the world, spread
misogyny and bigotry, ravaged the environment, and endorsed a child
molester,” Carol said. “But making people like us support the F.B.I. is

Trump Collapses From Exhaustion After Ninety Minutes of Faking Empathy,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Donald J. Trump collapsed from exhaustion after approximately ninety minutes of pretending to be a human being with empathy, the White House doctor has confirmed.
“In all my years of practicing medicine, I have never met a patient as healthy and vigorous as President Trump,” Dr. Ronny Jackson said. “But the sustained effort of simulating compassion proved too much for someone who has never exercised that part of his brain before.”
Shortly after Trump spent a gruelling ninety minutes pretending to care about immigrants, the unemployed, and other people whom he normally dismisses as losers, aides noticed that he was turning from a bright orange to a slightly paler orange before crumpling to the ground in a giant heap.
“If you have never spent a moment thinking about a human being besides yourself, imagine trying to pretend you are doing that for a solid ninety minutes,” Jackson said. “It’s physically punishing.”
Immediately following his collapse, Trump was rushed to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where a brain scan showed that his brush with human feelings did no permanent damage.
“I just visited with him, and he was sitting up in his bed, trashing Jay-Z on Twitter,” Dr. Jackson said. “It was such a relief to see that.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders Proofreads State of the Union One Last Time to Remove Any Remaining Facts,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is proofreading the text of tonight’s State of the Union address one last time to remove any remaining facts, Sanders confirmed on Tuesday.
While a team of wordsmiths led by the senior adviser Stephen Miller has attempted to craft an entirely fact-free address, “It’s good to have a fresh set of eyes to root out any stray accuracies that might have crept in,” Sanders said.
The press secretary said that, for example, while purging the speech of truths, she noticed a reference to the African-American unemployment rate standing at 6.8 per cent, a statistic that she deemed “unacceptably correct.”
“I read that and my Sanders sense started tingling,” she said.
Taking her blue pencil to the text, Sanders changed the number to a “better-sounding” 2.3 per cent. “That may seem like a tiny detail, but it’s stuff like that that separates the professional liars from the mere amateurs,” she said.
Once Sanders is confident that she has obliterated any lingering traces of reality from the script, she will forward it to Donald J. Trump, who will insert misspellings. “It makes him more comfortable reading it on the teleprompter if things are spelled his way,” she said.

“Fox & Friends” Putting Finishing Touches on Trump’s State of the Union Address,"NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)—With just one day until Donald J. Trump’s first State of the Union address, the cast of “Fox and Friends” is working furiously on the final draft of the speech, members confirmed today.
“We’ve really been burning the midnight oil,” Steve Doocy, the host of the Fox program, said. “We have so much to say tomorrow night, and we want to get it all in there.”
Doocy said that when he read the first draft of the State of the Union address last week, he “kind of flipped out” when he realized that there was “absolutely no mention of Hillary Clinton’s Hydra-like tentacles controlling the Deep State.”
“The State of the Union address is the President’s chance to tell the American people where the country is and where it’s going,” Doocy said. “You can’t do that without talking about how Crooked Hillary is funnelling her Russian-uranium riches directly into Bob Mueller’s bank account in the Seychelles.”
While Trump reportedly has had input from other sources, including the Fox News anchor Sean Hannity, the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and several neo-Nazi Twitter accounts, Doocy said that the cast of “Fox & Friends” has final approval of the version that Trump will read Tuesday night.

Video Emerges of Trump Lying Under Oath,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—One day after Donald J. Trump offered to testify under oath for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, a newly discovered video of Trump lying under oath has sent shock waves through Washington.
In the video, which experts believe was recorded approximately one year ago, Trump places his left hand on a Bible and raises his right hand before uttering a stream of falsehoods.
“The video shows him lying in front of what appears to be a substantial number of witnesses, including his wife and a Supreme Court Justice,” Davis Logsdon, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said. “It does raise questions about what, exactly, testifying under oath means to him.”
At the office of the special counsel, Mueller’s team was reportedly considering having Trump swear on something that was more meaningful to him than the Bible, such as a rolled-up copy of Forbes.

Jackson acknowledged in the note that his current assessment of Trump’s health was at odds with the robust picture he painted last week, but added, “Every patient is entitled to a second opinion, and this is mine.”
Minutes after the White House doctor issued his note, the special counsel responded by indicating that if Trump is too ill to come to Mueller’s office, then Mueller would be “more than happy” to interrogate Trump at his sickbed.

White House Staff Forced to Act Out Michael Wolff Book for Non-Reading President,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Donald J. Trump, legendary among U.S. Presidents for his aversion to reading, demanded on Thursday that members of his White House circle act out Michael Wolff’s new book, “Fire and Fury,” in a command performance in the Oval Office.
According to those who witnessed the dramatic presentation, Jared Kushner played the role of Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump played the role of Ivanka Trump, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders played Steve Bannon.
Sources who sat through the private performance of “Fire and Fury” said that Sanders’s portrayal of Bannon was particularly impressive.
“Sarah’s a natural,” one source said. “At the end of the day, acting is just lying.”
But the performer who “stole the show,” according to one source, was Eric Trump, who was cast in the role of his father.
“Eric played his dad like a bumbling, spoiled idiot who couldn’t do anything right,” the source said. “It was the role of a lifetime for him.”
The President, who sat stone-faced as the spectacle unfolded, became increasingly angry and agitated, especially as he witnessed Kellyanne Conway’s scathingly sarcastic portrayal of herself.

Trump Angrily Throws Steve Bannon’s Signed Copy of “Mein Kampf” in Trash,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Furious over a very public breakup with his former adviser Steve Bannon, Donald Trump on Wednesday angrily threw a copy of “Mein Kampf” that Bannon had inscribed to him in the trash.
The book, which Bannon had given to Trump as a token of his love and friendship during the 2016 campaign, had been among Trump’s most prized possessions, aides said.
“Trump loved that book, but now he feels that having Bannon’s name on it ruins it,” an aide said.
Another aide, however, cautioned not to make too much of the fact that Trump discarded the Bannon-signed Hitler book. “He’s still got plenty of other copies,” the aide said.
While most of Trump’s aides reflexively took their boss’s side in the dustup with Bannon, one staffer could not help expressing some sympathy for the exiled former adviser. “To be called mentally ill by Donald Trump—that’s got to hurt,” the aide said.",NaN,"January 3, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a4d6242fe22da2ed3a52cf3/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Trump-Breaks-Up-With-Bannon.jpg",Fake
Tillerson Caught Under Trump’s Desk Disconnecting Button,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was
caught crouching under Donald J. Trump’s Oval Office desk on
Wednesday, in an attempt to disconnect Trump’s newly installed nuclear
button.
The button, reportedly measuring a massive eight inches in diameter, has
been a subject of considerable alarm for Trump’s national-security team
since he had it installed on his desk, earlier in the week.
According to White House sources, Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis, and the national-security adviser H. R. McMaster drew straws
late Tuesday night to determine who would carry out the high-stakes
disconnection mission.
After Tillerson drew the shortest straw, he decided to enter the Oval
Office surreptitously Wednesday morning while Trump took a bathroom
break.
The Secretary of State had crawled under the desk and was on the verge
of disconnecting the gigantic button when he was surprised by the sudden
entrance of Vice-President Mike Pence, who had arrived to deliver his
daily praise of Trump.
Flustered, Tillerson muttered something about “looking for my glasses” and quickly exited.
Tillerson, who suffered a gash to the head when he bumped it on Trump’s
desk, was resting comfortably at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where
he was heard repeatedly mumbling the words “button” and “moron.”",NaN,"January 3, 2018",NaN,NaN,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a4d15416590681bc98f72e5/master/w_727,c_limit/Borowitz-Tillerson-Caught-Under-Trumps-Desk-Disconnecting-Button.jpg",Fake
Paul Ryan Says He Will Retire Once He Has Wrecked Country,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Starting 2018 with a political bombshell, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday that he will retire once he is satisfied that he has completely wrecked the country.
“I came to Washington with the goal of destroying life in the United States as we know it,” Ryan said in an emotional press conference. “Once I look around me and see nothing but smoldering ruins, I’ll call it a day.”
Asked by a reporter whether, by passing the Republican tax bill, he had not in fact already wrecked the country, the House Speaker responded, “That was an important step in the right direction, but, make no mistake, there is much havoc left to wreak.”
“There’s a lot of talk about the millions of people who will lose their health care, but no one one talks about the tens of millions who still have it,” he said. “That just shows how much work I still have to do.”

Roy Moore’s Defeat Means Ted Cruz Retains Status as Most Despised Person in Senate,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Roy Moore’s defeat in Alabama’s special election means that the Texas senator Ted Cruz will easily retain his status as the most despised person in the United States Senate, congressional insiders confirmed on Wednesday.
According to those insiders, Cruz had been secretly hoping that Moore’s election would displace him from his unenviable position as the most vilified pariah in the upper chamber.
“Cruz was praying that, if Moore got in, that might change the daily conversation around here from ‘Who has to sit next to Ted?’ ” one Republican colleague said.
Cruz, whom colleagues deem even more insufferable than such other senatorial ass-clowns as Mitch McConnell and Tom Cotton, was reportedly “distraught” upon learning that Moore would not be joining him in the U.S. Senate.

“If people think they’ve seen the last of Roy Moore, they are sorely mistaken,” a visibly devastated Moore said. “I’m going to get back up, dust myself off, and head on over to the good ol’ Gadsden Mall.”
But Moore’s plans for a rejuvenating return to his former stomping grounds hit a snag upon his arrival at the mall, where he found an impromptu victory party for the Democrat, Doug Jones, in full swing.
Adding insult to injury, security guards who recognized Moore from his mall-prowling days nabbed the disgraced Republican and hurled him from the premises.

Trump’s Slurred Speech Tied to Low Battery in Putin’s Remote,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Donald J.Trump slurred his speech during his announcement about Jerusalem on Wednesday because of “low-battery issues” with Vladimir Putin’s remote, the White House said on Friday.
Speaking to the White House press corps, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said that Trump’s slurred speech was “a case of what happens when President Putin doesn’t change the batteries in his remote frequently enough.”
“President Trump makes public appearances several times a day,” Sanders said. “In the course of those appearances, President Putin’s remote can drain its battery very quickly.”
Calling Putin’s remote-control operation of Trump “far from glitch-free,” Sanders said that there have also been problems with the Russian leader’s attempts to control Trump’s thumbs when he tweets in the early-morning hours.
“Sometimes President Putin has tried to operate President Trump’s thumbs and there has been the same low-battery issue,” she said. “This has resulted in random capital letters, misspellings, and, in some cases, gibberish.”

Nazis Feeling Neglected After Republicans’ Embrace of Child Molesters,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Several prominent Nazis said on Tuesday that they feel “neglected and hurt” by what they see as the Republican Party’s decision to court child molesters instead.
After the Republican National Committee agreed to fund the alleged child molester Roy Moore’s campaign for the United States Senate, aggrieved Nazis called the move a blatant attempt to pander to the child-molester vote.
“It seems like just last summer President Trump was saying what ‘fine people’ we were,” Heinz Dorrinson, an embittered Nazi from Mississippi, said. “Now it seems like all he can think about is his precious child molesters.”
Dorrinson warned that, in their frenzy to woo the child-molester vote, Republicans were playing a dangerous game by taking the Nazi vote for granted.
“President Trump needs to remember who put him in the White House,” Dorrinson said. “Nazis have feelings, too.”
In Washington, the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the battle between Nazis and child molesters for control of the Republican Party was largely an invention of the media.

Additionally, Dowd said that comments widely thought to have been made by Trump indicating that he believed that Frederick Douglass was still alive were also Dowd’s handiwork.
“President Trump was about to say something about whether Frederick Douglass was alive or not, and I stepped in at that moment and said that he was,” Dowd said. “I stand by that statement.”
Dowd went on to say that other actions attributed to Trump since he took office, including alienating NATO allies, stating that an imaginary armada was steaming toward North Korea, and naming Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director, were all actually done by Dowd.

Koch Brothers and N.R.A. Reach Timeshare Agreement Over Ownership of Paul Ryan,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz
Report)—In a unique
accord, the billionaire Koch brothers and the National Rifle Association
have reached a timeshare agreement over the ownership of House Speaker
Paul Ryan, representatives of both parties have confirmed.
Speaking on behalf of the Kochs, Charles Koch said that he contacted the
N.R.A.’s executive director, Wayne LaPierre, with the timeshare proposal “so
that we could all get the maximum enjoyment out of owning Paul.”
The arrangement is intended to minimize conflicts between the Kochs and
the gun group that have arisen in the past when both co-owners have
wanted to use Ryan at the same time, Koch said.
“I said to Wayne, ‘This is craziness,’ ” he said. “ ‘Let’s work something
out where you get Paul half the year, and we’ll take him the other
half.’ ”
Under the timeshare deal, the Kochs will have the exclusive use of Ryan
during the months when tax cuts and environmental deregulation are put
to a vote, while the N.R.A. will have him for the months when gun
legislation is to be defeated.
Additionally, each co-owner is responsible for insuring that Ryan is
well maintained and in good condition when the other’s period of using
him commences.
Koch indicated that, if the timeshare agreement is a success, the two
parties are likely to work out a similar deal for their longtime joint

"“Pocahontas” Not a Racial Slur, Says Prominent White Expert","WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Donald J. Trump’s use of the name “Pocahontas” at a White House event honoring Navajo veterans was not a racial slur, a prominent white expert said on Monday.

Moro Bars prepare for months-long stay in back of fridge ,"STUCK at the bottom of a bowl of Cadbury Favourites, unloved by young and old alike, three Moro Bars have laid out their plans for a months-long stay in the back of a South Melbourne refrigerator. 




“Christmas always starts off nicely,” said the ringleader. “I can’t help but smile wryly as those smug Flake bastards get devoured within minutes.”
“But then it gets to 3.30pm and you’re still hanging around, slowly melting, being randomly fingered before being put straight back. Even the sugar-loaded toddlers and smashed uncles won’t go for us for some reason.”
“It’s a pretty sad state of affairs when you’re the last one in the bowl, especially after Nan has come and taken all of the Turkish Delight.”
“I mean, seriously, we’re pretty much just a no-name Mars bar, and those things are freaking beloved! What more can we do? It’s time for a change.”
The Moros went on to lay out their manifesto for the long, cold months ahead, and their plans to make a name for themselves as more than a last resort or drunken mistake.
“If we can just last until Easter, reinforcements will surely arrive. Then we can start making some serious moves towards freedom and the recognition we deserve.”

Dyslexic child stays up on Christmas Eve waiting for Satan ,"Local parents Mark and Irene Butler report they were “shocked and alarmed” to hear their five year old son Bobby announce he will be staying up tonight in the hope of meeting Satan, declaring they were previously unaware that he is either dyslexic or a member of the occult. 




Seeking to clarify whether Bobby was simply confused or required immediate attention by a priest, Mark and Irene attempted to get Bobby to describe the man he was hoping to see. However, Bobby’s response that he was waiting “for the sounds of hooves on the roof, followed by the appearance of a magic red man who laughs a lot and punishes bad kids” did little to put their minds at ease.
Being modern parents Mark and Irene have decided they will try to accept Bobby for who he is, and they will strive to be open to the possibility that their son may be channelling the dark lord of the underworld in his sleep. “At first we considered trying to correct him and put him on a less evil path,” says Mark, “but in the end we decided to just let it be. We wouldn’t want to infringe on his freedom of religion.”
“Plus, when push comes to shove, it doesn’t really matter whether he thinks it’s Satan or Santa that brings him gifts,” added Irene. “After all sooner or later he’s going to come to his senses and realise that the whole Bible thing is just a fairy tale made up to trick kids into being good to get rewards.

Family Christmas cancelled after argument about whether it’s Yanni or Laurel Wreath ,"Hospitals across the country have been flooded this holiday season, in what is being described as “the worst outbreak of seasonal mondegreen based arguments since Christmas crackers included a joke using the word ‘forehead’ in 1994.” 




Just like then, doctors are reporting numerous patients coming to them with injuries resulting from altercations
among family members over the pronunciation of words. “This year it seems to be yanny wreaths that are causing all the hubbub.” said local hospital surgeon Dr Siobhan Saoirse before being corrected by nearby oncologist Dr Sean Johnston, who was certain that it had always been pronounced “laurel wreath”.
The influx of patients couldn’t have come at a worse time for the nation’s hospitals, with the medical system already under intense strain from those who sustained injuries from arguing about whether a Santa should be “gender neutral”.

Hungry Jacks $4 internships to provide youth with valuable experience in getting fucked over by large corporations ,"Hungry Jacks has today justified their controversial decision to offer internships that would be largely funded by taxpayer money, by pointing out that these jobs would provide the youth of today with valuable experience in the field of getting fucked over by a multi-national corporation, which is essential in today’s job market. 




“Whether they continue on with the Hungry Jacks family, or decide to pursue a different path in say the tech sector, or working in finance, retail, or media, we guarantee that every intern that comes through our doors will find the exact same ruthless money oriented corporate structure at any of today’s major employers. And the fact that you’ve already been exploited by one well recognised chain will be music to any recruiter’s ears, believe you me. Normally these companies would have to spend months indoctrinating new staff into believing having a table tennis table and free M&Ms in the office is a suitable substitute to paid sick leave.”
The Morrison government has also defended the internship programme, pointing out that it was fulfilling its promise to provide young people with the opportunity to find jobs in fields where they normally couldn’t. “There once was a time where Hungry Jacks would only accept the best of the best,” explained Morrison, “but now, thanks to millions of dollars of Australian taxpayer money, every kid will have the opportunity to work as a burger flipper at a fast-food chain restaurant as their first job.”
“Ask anyone in economics, and they’ll agree, the thing the youth of today need most is more qualifications and lower wages,” continued Morrison. “I mean, it’s not like young people are facing an unprecedented combination of stagnant wages, skyrocketing costs of living, ballooning education costs, and impossibly high real-estate entry prices. We’re certainly not living in an age where young people are having to fork out a significant percentage of their incomes to super while also being expected to shoulder the costs that come with the privatisation of previously public utilities that were sold off to pay for the pensions of a growing number of baby boomers whose retirement will be significantly government funded and whose medical costs are already blowing out the price of private health insurance which the government is forcing young people into purchasing through tax hikes while simultaneously refusing to remove tax incentives for negative gearing which is disproportionately exploited by elderly wealthy people who grew up during a time where tertiary education was free and property was affordable to all. No, that would be ludicrous.”

Everyone now understands why George Christensen opposed safe schools ,"The entire Australian public has breathed a collective sigh of realisation following the revelation that George Christensen has been linked to sex tourism allegations in Asia. 




George Christensen has long voiced his opposition to safe schools.
Christensen called for Australia to return to less safe schools, which he much prefers.
The federal government MP has been a long-standing advocate of not having safe schools, and said he’d much prefer it if Australia didn’t have any safe schools at all.

Office conversation spiced up by slightly inclement weather ,"An accounting firm in the CBD has experienced a rather unorthodox day of operations today, after it was found to have mildly drizzled during the morning commute. Employees across the city were reported to be in celebration after finally finding something uncontroversial yet relatable that they can discuss with their with everyone they made eye contact with on the way to the break room.




“Bit wet out there!” declared Jason, a bookkeeper known for very little.

“Haha, it’s ridiculous isn’t it? Lucky I got the washing in yesterday!” replied Melody the receptionist, before awkwardly smiling and looking down at her coffee cup, having exhausted all her wet weather material for the day.

It was reported that such enthusiastic observations carried on well in to the day as little changed outside. Quieter members of the firm were even found to have a new zest as the shared experience finally gave them an opener.

“Think it’ll stop before knock off? Don’t really want to be caught in it,” remarked office drone Shane.

“Oh, who knows!” replied office matriarch Jo enthusiastically.

Jo was later heard stating that she had no idea who that man was. ",NaN,"December 18, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_1218841084.jpg,Fake
Elf on the Shelf detained by Australian Border Force ,"Christmas is in turmoil following news that the infamous Elf on a Shelf – a magical being that monitors children’s behaviour during the day before returning to the North Pole every night to report to Santa Claus – has been detained by the Australian Border Force during a targeted operation. 




“We did receive information from multiple sources that the Elf on the Shelf was making undocumented arrivals and departures through Australian borders,” said Home Affairs Minister and known Naughty Boy Peter Dutton. 
“Thankfully our commando squad captured him in a daytime raid with relative ease as he was in a catatonic – possibly drug-induced – state, with only minimal damage sustained to my daughter’s bedroom.” 
“We can’t just have an individual entering and leaving the country on multiple occasions without the proper clearance and checks by Border Force officials, despite what my wife and daughter will try to tell you.”
“Furthermore, we suspect this guy is one of the chief lieutenants in an international smuggling network ran by a wanted figure with known links to occultism and unregulated sweatshop labour.”
Australia’s children responded with glee to news of the Elf’s capture. 
“Finally we are free from the yoke of oppression wrought by this omnipotent shill of my parents’ anachronistic regime,” said Sherra-Lee Lewis, 5, of Dapto. 
“Who are they to tell me what good and bad is? Mum and dad can get fucked, I’m gonna stop eating my greens and start smashing nangs instead, and there’s nothing they can do about it. Not to mention that doll is just creepy AF. Thanks, Mr Dutton!”

English teacher writes novel about teaching English ,"Although her weekdays are spent educating Wollongong students on the importance of Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson and Peter Goldsworthy, English teacher Sharne Mitchell, 48, has a deeper passion – her magnum opus on the turbulent inner life of a late-40s woman who educates Wollongong students on the importance of Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson and Peter Goldsworthy. 




Mitchell’s Dusty Textbooks & Liquid Paper is, in her own words, “a dark and gritty exploration of love, learning and the trials of being Supervisor Of Girls.” At 450 pages, the novel spans four terms in the life of Relieving Deputy Head Teacher – English, Rae Sjostedt.
“I used Conrad’s Heart Of Darkness as a kind of framework and inspiration for Dusty Textbooks,” Mitchell said. “In the same way Marlow traverses the waters of the Congo River to find a spiritual barbarism within himself, Rae braves the murky depths of bottom Year 10 poetry to find they have no knowledge of rhyme, metaphor or iambic pentameter.”
Mitchell has also worked in some of her experiences as a Rock Eisteddfod co-ordinator: “Nothing can compare to the dizzying highs and crashing lows that accompany a hundred teenage girls in leotards, dancing in unison to U2’s With Or Without You. I’ve used the ‘Fod experience to mirror Rae’s fruitless search for a staffroom soulmate.”
Some critics have chided Mitchell for basing certain characters on real-life people, but the author claims she was careful to avoid direct analogues. “People think Neil ‘Butch’ Wilde is based on [Year 8 bully] Beau Wiles, but he’s more of an amalgam of all the fat, obnoxious loudmouths I’ve had in my classroom over my 21 years of teaching.”
Dusty Textbooks & Liquid Paper is yet to be picked up by a publisher, but Mitchell remains confident it will eventually be included on the HSC syllabus. She has also commenced work on a sequel, tentatively titled Beyond The Chalkface. “It’s more of a fantasy work,” she explained. “Following the painful demise of Neil Wilde, Rae wins the lottery and is able to retire to southern France, where she drinks champagne, writes moving sonnets and has a whirlwind romance with a young, handsome gardener.”",NaN,"December 16, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/teacher.jpg,Fake
Applicant inspired by rejection letter ,"The failure of jobseeker Joseph Adams to gain employment was tempered earlier this week, as the HR department of JB HiFi wrote him a heartfelt, encouraging letter. 




“They regretfully told me that the calibre of applicants was unusually high,” Adams reported, “and that unfortunately this time they were unable to advance my candidacy to the next stage of the recruitment process.”
Adams, who applied for a customer service position in the company’s Wollongong shop, felt confident after his initial interview. “The store manager and I really connected – especially when I told her I knew [former employee] Reece. I guess the other applicants must have been super electronics geniuses or something.”
The rejection letter went on to thank Joseph for taking an interest in the company, and for his application, before wishing him well in future endeavours. “I suppose if this guy doesn’t work out I’m next on the list.

CEO given massive bonus for not sending company bankrupt ,"The head of a key technology business was granted a massive bonus yesterday to recognise his performance in not running the company into the ground. TechnoCorp CEO Warren Blair was rewarded by the board for his “world’s best practice” leadership after not quite driving the company into receivership over the past 12 months. 




Blair’s bonus is valued at $1.4 million, or 25 per cent of his base pay. On top of this amount, Blair can also expect a 5 per cent Bonus Delivery Bonus. The swag of options he has taken up in the company are also expected to be worth an extra $560,000 after the Techno Corp share price rose 4 cents last week after the market rewarded Blair’s daring, highly original strategy for FY19/20, when he plans to sack most of the workforce and selling key assets in a fire sale to pay creditors.
TechnoCorp Chairman Ryan Kumar explained that to attract business leaders who have a truly world-class ability to maximise the short-term share price while endangering the company’s long-term stability, Technocorp needed to offer them salary packages that are also world-class. “It’s all about global standards, and we really have to splash out to keep in touch with the US on this,” Kumar said.
Kumar said that Blair is also being rewarded for meeting his other stringent performance targets, such as only decreasing market share by 30 per cent and not getting caught paying any kickbacks to Russian oligarchs.
The Chairman denied claims that the board had been too generous to Blair in light of the company’s lacklustre revenue performance. “Let’s not forget that these payments are not guaranteed – they’re an incentive. Blair would certainly have missed out on this bonus if he had been even more incompetent,” Kumar said.
“I mean, he would still have received it, but it would certainly have had to be renamed. Maybe something like an Annual Incentivisation Payment or an Executive Remuneration Continuation Bonus.”
Kumar and the rest of the TechnoCorp Board will also be receiving a huge bonus for awarding the CEO such an enormous bonus. “Many people have alleged that our tied bonus system leads to inadequate supervision and a conflict of interest, but fortunately they were only shareholders,” he said.
Blair said he was pleased with his income over the previous financial year, but felt it could be still improved. “I’d like to see myself taking home in excess of $10 million next year, and the best way to do that is perform so badly that the Board has to sack me and give me a huge termination bonus,” Blair said. “For a CEO, that’s where the real money is.”",NaN,"December 12, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/ceo.jpg,Fake
Local man spends entire conversation trying to remember other person’s name ,"Local partygoer Joel Edmumd has today battled through two awkward hours of conversation, following a rushed introduction to a number of people who’s names he has already forgotten. 




“I swear they told me,” reported Joel from inside the bathroom where he had taken refuge, “It’s just that the conversation moved on so fast, I didn’t even have a chance to commit them to memory before they were already asking me about my job.”
“By the time I realised I’d forgotten their names it was far to awkward to bring it up again.”
Witnesses say Mr Edmund was trapped in the conversation for nearly two hours before finally being rescued by concerned onlookers. “It was pretty clear from the look of panic in his eyes that there was something very wrong,” admitted acquaintance Erin Brooks this afternoon. “When he started to say the line ‘Oh hi Erin, have you met…’ and then just trailed off, I knew I had to act – jumping in with ‘Yes, of course I know James’ just moments before the entire conversation imploded.”
Joel is reportedly shaken by the experience, but has not been put off attending future social gatherings. “I learned a valuable lesson today,” says Joel, “from now on I’ll put all my effort into memorising people’s names when they tell them to me. I can’t wait till I can start impressing people by sprinkling their names throughout conversations – you know after I’ve worked out what the fuck they were talking about in the two minutes it took to commit their names to memory.”",NaN,"December 11, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/man_at_party.jpg,Fake

Owners of Big Banana disappointed it hasn’t been named as a terror target ,"Colorful Coffs Harbour business identity Pete Monkhouse has criticised Australia’s aspiring terrorists for failing to name The Big Banana as a potential target this coming festive season. “All we ever hear about terrorist attacks in Australia is Opera House this, Federation Square that,” Monkhouse complained. “I wonder if ISIS and the like realise just how big this banana is. I mean, we’re talking about the biggest banana in the world. Or at least New South Wales” 




Monkhouse says that his Big Banana souvenir store, café and ice rink, would be a worthy target for a terrorist. “Perhaps they don’t understand the strategic importance of the Big Banana for the entire Coffs Harbour region,” he said. “Or maybe they do, and are afraid they’ll choke under the pressure.”
Monkhouse also blames the media, with the exception of the Coffs Harbour Advocate, for ignoring the Big Banana in coverage of possible terror targets. “You just have to look at some of the places they’ve included,” Monkhouse explained. “Like Lucas Heights, for god’s sake! There’s nothing even remotely oversized there.”
After the September 2001 terrorist attacks Monkhouse had always anticipated an attack on the Big Banana. “If they hate our freedom, they certainly hate our banana,” he said. “It’s a quintessential part of the Australian way of life. Come and see why – we’re open late for daylight savings.”
Just in case he’s proven correct, Monkhouse has taken matters into his own hands, running a “Visit Now Before We’re Destroyed” promotion all summer holidays.",NaN,"December 10, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/big-banana.jpg,Fake
Police give up: crime investigations to be done only by podcast hosts from now on ,"The police force announced today that it had decided to give up trying to work out who committed all the unsolved murders and robberies, and instead rely on investigations by the hosts of true crime podcasts to solve crime. 




The announcement follows the arrest of Chris Dawson, the subject of an award-winning Podcast The Teacher’s Pet, on charges of murdering his wife more than three decades ago.
“Look, to be honest, it’s probably a good thing,” said one police detective.
“I’m not really a details person anyway,” said Detective Inspector Randall Pugh from the Queensland Crime Squad. “These people are far more interested in following up every lead than I’ve ever been. My modus operandi over the years has usually been to find someone from an ethnic minority to pin the crime on and then plant the evidence,” said Detective Pugh.
“Actually going an interviewing all the witnesses seems like an awful lot of work. But if they’re happy to do it, then good on them.”
Meanwhile podcasters have welcomed the news. “I actually solved a series of cold case murders from the 1970s this morning,” said podcaster Brian Tate. “But before I reveal who did them, I’d like to tell you about the excellent deal on webhosting from Squarespace.com.”",NaN,"December 6, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_1100919158.jpg,Fake
Guy at school reunion remembers way too much ,"Ten years after they finished high school together, former Young Achiever Lee Rosken can recall minor personality quirks and biographical details about every single one of his classmates, an ability he demonstrated at his reunion late last year. “Lee was pretty quiet at school,” said reunion organiser Anna Aprile. “Which made it kinda creepy that he could describe all the different outfits I wore on mufti days.” 




Without obvious malice or agenda, Rosken spent the vast majority of the night bringing up humiliating events from the past, in the guise of funny stories. “I assumed my first period was something only I would remember,” said Susan Veech. “But Lee recounted every excruciatingly embarrassing detail in front of three science teachers, my fiance and Bryce Chadstone – my high school crush. I was ready to crawl into a hole and die, and then he says, ‘Hey, remember that massive pimple you had for, like, three weeks?’ He must really hate me.”
David Pinder had a similar encounter with Rosken’s total recall of his school years: “All I did was bring up this one time in PE when he and I got in trouble for stealing a tee-ball stand. Next thing I know he’s talking about how much he loved the Nikes I used to wear. Then I spent about 40 minutes listening to a recap of some handball game before Harshula turned up and got me off the hook.”
Over the course of the night, Rosken managed to make cooking teacher Mrs Crawford cry, cause a fistfight by reigniting a long-forgotten Year 8 argument about Street Fighter 2, and break up the marriage of high school sweethearts Brendan and Tina Hayes by casually telling the story of the time he saw Brendan and Emma Phelps kissing behind the assembly hall one lunchtime.
“The worst part is, I have no idea who Lee is,” said Tina, sobbing. “Apparently he used to sit behind me in Mr Walker’s maths class and watch me draw flowers in my grid book, but I can’t remember him at all.”",NaN,"December 3, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/reunion-1024x695.jpg,Fake
Murdoch launches bid for under-9s netball team ,"Sydney’s lucrative junior league netball broadcasting market was shaken yesterday by the launch of a historic bid by one of the world’s most predatory entrepreneurs, Rupert Murdoch, to secure ownership of the most successful team in the league. 




The Clontarf Nuggets under-9s, currently leading the league table by 16 points, look set to take yet another pennant this year, despite being dogged by injuries and allegations of steroid use by key goal attack, Jenny Reid.
The club has seen its share price depressed over the past six months despite strong growth in its merchandising and promotion budgets and the proposed launch of a website used to reach Nuggets supporters throughout the world.
“There’s a lot of interest in the area, driven by the need to develop pay TV subscriber numbers in key markets such Abbey Street, Regent Street and Clontarf Road,” noted Macquarie Bank analyst, Gregory Simons. “The Nuggets are a key asset in securing those customers.”
“News has chosen a clever time to strike, because the share price is flat because the market fears a likely slowdown in growing subscriber numbers outside its traditional suburban areas of Clontarf Junction and the three blocks west of North Sydney station. It’s a classic Murdoch play.”
There was celebration last night at Clontarf Public School Hall where many initial investors have seen their stock rise from a pre-listing subscription price of 20 cents to over $6,000 since listing on the ASX. “We’re over the moon,” said one shareholder, who preferred not to be identified. “When we were deciding how to raise capital for the new uniforms, it was either the public float or a lucky dip. All I can say is, the investment bankers got it right. Woo Hoo!”
Not all shareholders are pleased at the prospect of a takeover by Murdoch. The Nuggets Supporters Association, formed at a rally today, dedicated itself to challenging this ‘cynical attempt by an American billionaire to commercialise a grand Australian tradition.’
The NSA argues that, in any event, the offer grossly undervalues the stock. “The poor showing in first quarter earnings was driven by poor sausage sizzle figures, on the back of poor spring weather,” argues Brendan Thompson, 31, of Clontarf. “The share price is temporarily depressed. With the approach of summer, we should expect to see an upward trend in sales of core service offerings, such as sausage-in-a-bun and cordial.”
Parties opposed to the bid also point to current plans to move into high-margin e.commerce delivery systems, driving down production costs and raising revenue. Thompson described under-7s netball teams as having ‘natural synergies’ with the development of on-line services.
“With the Internet, we can cut out the middleman entirely. We expect savings to account for up to 30% of current costs. That’s like 19 cents off every chocolate crackle sold on-line, instead of at the cake stall.”
Team manager, Hurbert Hurbert, was refusing to comment on the bid last night, preferring instead to focus on the last four games remaining this season. “My players are concentrating on fitness, and ensuring that everyone remembers to bring their mouthguards on Saturday morning,” said Hurbert.
“We’re not interested in the stock-market bid, although lots of the parents are shareholders. We just want to get on and play netball.”",NaN,"December 2, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/netty.png,Fake
Parents take up hallucinogens after discussing drugs with son ,"Local couple Jane and Henry Simcox have become avid users of recreational drugs, after sitting down with their teenage son to frankly discuss the facts surrounding the illicit substances. The incident was said to have occurred as a result of a family conference late yesterday, after schoolboy Nicholas Simcox, 17, convinced his parents Jane, 51, and Henry, 56, of the various upsides of using drugs. 




“Initially Henry and I were completely opposed to all mind altering substances, and were determined to make Nicholas quit”, says Mrs Simcox, “However, once we’d sat down and all spoken openly, it seemed he actually had quite a good case. He certainly made it sound fantastic, and once he’d outlined the history of drug bans and their use as a proxy tool to disrupt black communities by the Nixon administration, we realised that we’d really only been hearing half the story.”
“Henry and I then decided it would be a good idea to embark on a bit of research ourselves, so we had Nicky call up one of his little friends to bring round a few spliffs, and spent the rest of the evening hotboxing while listening to Bob Marley.”
Mr Simcox says that was an eye opening experience for the couple, who for the first time realised how life changing drug use could be. “I decided we might as well try some other drugs, given how well the marijuana experiment went,” explains Mr Simcox. “So we got our hands on some north coast Psilocybin and proceeded to give our third eyes a thorough cleansing.
“That was three weeks ago and now I can’t even remember what I had against drugs in the first place!” exclaims Mrs Simcox. “Or for that matter where I’ve been for the last eight days! In fact I can’t get enough of the stuff. You wouldn’t happen to have any on you would you? Those mushroom shakes disappeared quicker than my fundamental understanding of the nature of reality.”",NaN,"December 1, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2001/06/parents-1024x594.jpg,Fake
15 minutes of study rewarded with 2 hour Netflix binge ,"Local student and allround failure of a human being Mindy Small has today rewarded herself with a 2 hour Netflix binge, following an intense study session that saw her write the opening and closing paragraphs of her 3000 word essay, before getting up to check what’s in the fridge. 




“I really needed this,” explained Mindy, following her eighth episode of Sabrina for the day. “Sure I only spent 15 minutes on the assignment, but what people fail to consider is the hours of stress I’ve endured in the last week from just thinking about having to do the assignment without actually doing it.”
“It completely ruined my ability to enjoy the last three nights I’ve spent out with friends instead of doing my assignment like I should have been doing if I weren’t such a complete piece of shit,” explained Mindy. “And yes some people might say ‘well why didn’t you just do the assignment first and then enjoy the rest of the week,’ but what I don’t think those people understand is that I’m an awful, useless bag of trash masquerading as a human being.”

Precocious 2nd grader writes memoir of holidays ,"Set the topic “What I did during my holidays” as a class writing assignment, 8 year-old student Bradley K. Milton has produced a discursive, Proustian reminiscence, heavy with nostalgia for a youth that somehow seems weeks ago. The foolscap page-long roman à clef, written in pencil, is a vision of a happier, simpler time in the author’s life, when days were measured only by the opening and closing hours of Warner Brothers’ Movie World. 




“Those days come back to me as one,” the young dilettante wrote, after a brief introductory exegesis on the subject of memory. “One endless day, suffused with laughter and golden light, taking place in no place but in my pure state of happiness, extant now only in my mind, and perhaps not even there, for even those eyes through which I saw my childhood have now grown cloudy with age, and some solid thing, perhaps time itself, begins to occlude my memory, waking me from my reveries as clearly as the sound of the bell for recess.”
His stream-of-consciousness in free flow, Bradley then attempted a subtle, symbolic conflation of the long car trip to the Gold Coast and the complex emotional undercurrents in his seemingly happy family.

“The time-share apartment was not the domain of my mother, who acquiesced to the role of a subordinate with a kind of relieved resignation, a sentiment, that in time, my sister and I came to share: for it was Aunt Anne who fussed over us – cooking, cleaning, keeping a happy vigil from the sand as we paddled in the foam – she played with us, though shyly, (and with that spirit of interminable enthusiasm peculiar to the childless), and it was she who felt the end of those sunlit days most keenly, her drawn face coloured a muted azure by the tinting on the Subaru’s back window and the light of the setting sun, the waves of her hand ebbing into a blur in the distance as we drove quickly away – I see it ever clear even now, some eleven days later.”  
Bradley’s next work is expected to be on the topic “The person I admire most”, and he plans to write it about himself.",NaN,"November 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/kid.jpg,Fake

When Mr Sampson completes the year-long course, he plans to travel around South America for 12 weeks before returning to his old job. “I will really appreciate chilling out in the Andes, and catching some rays in Brazil when I finish. But then the tyranny of the capitalist oppressors will have me back working as a management consultant.
“After all, being a wage slave is the only way I’ll be able to pay off my apartment in Bronte and save up for that meditation retreat in Goa. The world is a cruel place, but what can you do?”

Santa’s workshop outsourced to Third World elves ,"The North Pole was hit with a series of devastating mass lay-offs yesterday when throngs of elves, some of whom had been working in the workshop for hundreds of years, found themselves locked out of the candy-coloured wooden entrance of Santa’s Toy Factory. 




A handwritten scroll tacked to the gates informed them their services would no longer be required. No further official statement was made by management, and when Mrs Claus was seen leaving the darkened factory from a side entrance, she refused to comment.
On the advice of management consultants, the toy workshop has already made attempts to reduce costs by adopting smaller stocking sizes and stricter criteria for deciding which children are good. But the pull of cheap labour from Chinese and Indian elves ultimately seems to have proved too strong for Santa’s one-time workforce.
A spokesman for the United Union of Working Elves, Leprechauns and Cymbal-playing Monkeys says that the lay-offs come as a shock. “This is the worst thing to happen to the elf community since Dobby died in the last Harry Potter,” said Twinklekins McNurty, 243. “Where are we supposed to go now? Mordor?”
Elf sociologists are already warning of the bleak consequences of sustained unemployment in the Arctic, which has already been devastated by climate change. “Employment opportunities are very limited,” says Poppy “Red Hat” Bobbins. “A few of these workers might get a job in a gardening commercial, but for the rest, egg-nog abuse is a real possibility.”
The bad news may not stop there. Industry rumours say that redundancies have already been planned on the sleigh team, with long-serving employees Blitzen and Prancer tipped to get the chop. The firings may see the whole sleigh team may eventually be replaced by a group of mechanized robot reindeer, which can work 24 hours a day without tiring or experiencing self-esteem issues on account of to the redness of their noses.

Belief system debunked by T-shirt ,"Churches around the nation have reported a sharp decline in attendance following the revelation of a dogma-shattering item of clothing. The T-shirt, which bears a humorously blasphemous slogan, is believed to have undermined the core tenets of 2000 years of Christianity. “Our faith has survived persecution, child abuse allegations and the Spanish Inquisition,” said Vatican official George Pell. “But this garment has proven too strong for Jesus Christ.” 




Even more troubling than the impending dissolution of the church, says small town Reverend John Buchanan, is the ignominy of its downfall at the hands of a t-shirt saying ‘Religion, we can find a cure.’ “I wouldn’t mind if decades of research and deep philosophical musing on the numerous inconsistencies of the Bible had eventually made a mockery of the system. But that t-shirt isn’t even trying,” he said. “It’s enough to shake your faith in the existence of a benevolent God.”
Theologians claim this conflict has been a long time coming. “Shirts with jokes like ‘I found Jesus: he was hidden behind the couch the whole time’ printed on them seemed to be nothing more than harmless ribbing, but such is the way Satan works – hiding sin behind a façade of innocence,” says Professor Adam Frankland. “Or at least that’s the way he would work, if he was real.”
The shirt’s designer, Steve Holkins, has gone into hiding to work on his next range of humorous attire, after receiving death threats from fundamentalist Christians worldover. In addition, a group of extremist Muslims has warned Holkins to “stay away from Allah puns”, however they conceded his shirt saying “Picture of God” with a blank space below it was acceptable.
Some church officials have refused to give up the fight, deciding the best way to combat the T-shirt is with some catchy slogans of their own. “Our ‘God Doesn’t Believe In Atheists’ range is really going to put a rocket up those soulless heathens,” said Gerald Bündchen, who also came up with the ‘Want To Know My Sign? It’s a Cross’ advertising campaign.
This is not the first time a garment has brought down a system – political scientists have found strong parallels between the fall of the Soviet Union and red shirt bearing a picture of Karl Marx with a lampshade on his head, entitled ‘Communist Party’.

Numerous students, especially those studying for a Receipt in the Arts expressed outrage, although luckily for University administrators most had skipped class, and thus were in Manning Bar during the announcement.
A spokesperson for the University explained that this is part of the University’s move towards a more candid view of education, “allowing for the student to have a clear view of what they are actually achieving”.
“The Receipt can be purchased for as little as $35,000, takes three years to complete and is non-refundable. The University guarantees the course will get your parents off your back. Most importantly in this economic climate, it gives students much-needed experience in acquiring debt.”
Once attained, the Receipt can be used to enter over half of University of Sydney’s degrees, although the receipt won’t be accepted at any other University. “This way we keep all possible dividend and assets within the University… by assets I’m, of course, referring to students”.
On the back of this innovative move, Monash University has announced a similar scheme. Its three-year Arts Voucher can be cashed in for a low level marketing job or a PhD at Monash.",NaN,"November 17, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sydney-1024x686.jpg,Fake
"Calling people ‘un-Australian’ isn’t racist, claims racist ","A local racist has claimed that calling people ‘un-Australian’ isn’t racist. 




Peter Roch – who has a Southern Cross sticker on his car and enjoys yelling at foreigners on the train in his spare time – announced to friends on Friday that calling someone un-Australian was based on facts, not opinion.
“Take for example that terrorist-looking guy, Ahmed, from down the street. It’s just true to say that Ahmed doesn’t know word-for-word every Cold Chisel song. That’s un-Australian. It’s got nothing to do with the colour of his skin, although that’s pretty un-Australian too, come to think of it.”
Mr Roch later claimed that calling someone un-Australian was protected by “our constitutional right to free speech”.
When Mr Roch was told that no such protections for freedom of speech exist in Australia’s constitution, and that he must be talking about the US Bill of Rights, Mr Roch responded that the Australian constitution seemed to him to be pretty un-Australian.",NaN,"November 16, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bogan.jpg,Fake

Video game violence blamed for sudden spike in Stagecoach robberies ,"PARENTS groups are up in arms after an unprecedented increase in stagecoach robbery and hog-tying since the release of Red Dead Redemption 2.




Now little more than a rare sight in parks and the heart of major cities, one stagecoach operator claimed they were ‘sitting ducks’ for scores of adolescents who have ‘swapped their gang colours and baseball caps for Stetsons and kerchiefs across the face’.
“Before, my biggest problem used to be animal rights activists harassing me for cruelty and calling for boycotts and people trying to have sex in the back,” he said.
“Those were the good old days. Now I’m just being robbed frequently.
“Just yesterday a group of kids cut me off on a bridge, hog-tied me and threw me into the river. It was horrible – they were doing the worst accents – claiming my coach would ‘fetch a good price at Emerald Ranch’.
“I don’t know where that is exactly, but if it’s out of the city good luck to them. I’m mainly annoyed because they keep stealing my pelts before I can get them to the trapper.
“Luckily I just sleep for a few hours and it magically returns.”
Parents are also feeling the alleged negative effects of the game at home.
“My son used to just sit in his room playing Grand Theft Auto,” said concerned mother Miriam Blanket.
“Sure, he might have been stealing cars and killing prostitues, but that was all make believe. Now that he’s playing Red Dead, he comes downstairs drinking Bourbon, he’s got a bow and arrow and he’s skinning all the neighbourhood pets. He still insists he’s a good boah, though, whatever that means.
“When I tell him to stop he just storms off calling me ‘such a fucking Micah.’ I should have got him that Spiderman game instead, but then he’d just be spending all his time upstairs shooting white sticky stuff with his hands and he already does that enough. I only just cleaned that sock drawer.”",NaN,"November 13, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rdr2story.jpg,Fake
News Corp editor dies of joy after realising they can use the headline “strawberry needler needled” ,"Citizens across the country have taken to the streets today, to celebrate the end of the reign of fear and terror that has gripped the country since September, with the announcement that authorities have finally apprehended the infamous strawberry tamperer. 




News corp editor, champion of the common man, and part time inner-west residing millionaire Chris Trustfund said the news was a momentous day for the Australians – and especially journalists. “When we heard the culprit had been caught, a cheer went up across the newsroom,” laughed Chris. “It finally put an end to our worry that we might never be able to use that headline ‘Strawberry needler needled‘ that’s been sitting idle on the whiteboard for months now.”
“My only regret is we didn’t find an angle to blame the situation on trans kids,” continued Chris, “though I have recently seen compelling evidence that the rise in fruit tampering may be directly correlated with the rise of gender-neutral bathrooms. I mean, do you think it’s a coincidence that this has happened only months after same-sex marriage was legalised? Sure it might be, but it’s hardly my job as a journalist to critically analyse inflammatory claims before broadcasting them to millions of easily influenced readers.”
However it was not all good news for the editors at the Murdoch mouthpiece, with the capture of the strawberry sleuth ending what had been a lucrative story for the newspaper. “Now instead of beating up a story about three needles being found in a supply of over 12 million strawberries, we’re going to have to go back to boring old stories about how the financial sector is defrauding millions of people out of their retirement savings,” sighed Chris. “That’s not why I got into journalism.”
Police have also stated that while they may have found the culprit, the investigation will be ongoing and that a further $5 million will be invested into the anti-fruit tampering department in coming years.
“We’ve learned a lot from this multi-million dollar and month long investigation – gone are the days where we can afford to be naively lax about the safety of our fruit and vegetables,” announced the new head of the government’s new Fruit Force this afternoon, “For all we know this could simply have been one instance in a network of terrorist fruit tampering cells. But the good news is we now have plane clothes officers working in every farm, packing facility and fruit aisle across the country. If anyone thinks they can slip a needle past us, well they probably can, but still – it  sure helps make the government look tough on crime doesn’t it?”",NaN,"November 12, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/strawberry-1024x597.jpg,Fake
Cash Converters owner impressed at how many TVs one regular customer owns ,"Melbourne-based Cash Converters owner Dylan Thompson has voiced his admiration for local man, Marcus Bowers, and his impressive collection of electrical goods he sells to Thompson on a weekly basis. 




Thompson recently confided in his wife that perhaps he is in the wrong career path after Bowers – a seemingly unemployed ‘exporter importer’ – sold him his fifth flat screen of the week.
“He must live in a mansion. Imagine needing five televisions for your house. You can tell he’s a family man too, always upgrading his kids games, coming in to trade old Xboxs and portable Nintendos.”
“Even though Bowers must be incredibly wealthy he always wears the same set of clothes, it must be a Steve Jobs sort of thing. Absolute genius.”
While Thompson is going through marital troubles he has confirmed that ‘the ladies love Bowers.’
“He doesn’t have a care in the world. Every week he seems to be cashing in a wedding ring from his previous romantic escapade. He must have had 20 marriages since I met him!”
Apart from frequently offloading his old goods, Bowers has improved the business in another way. He advised Thompson to stop advertising during the morning chat shows, a time which Thompson thought would suit mature homeowners.
Instead he is now advertising at the cheaper time slot of 4:30am and has seen an incredible growth in his business, predominately from Bowers’ business associates wishing to offload numerous Xbox 360s and power tools.
“Maybe early morning brainstorming is the trick to becoming the type of multi-millionaire that gets to hang out at the local park all day in your tracksuit. Man, what a life!”
Bowers hasn’t visited the store in several weeks, although Thompson is confident he will return..
“He’s probably just sorting out some sort of top end of town business deal!” says Thompson.
However, other locals report that Bowers is due to face court in a few days regarding allegations of breaking into cars that were parked on a busy main road.
But according to Thompson, “Bowers just had a bit too much to drink and thought it was his own. “He probably has, like, twenty cars.”",NaN,"November 11, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cash.jpeg,Fake
God’s plan is for man’s life to suck ,"Regular churchgoer Miles Carruthers, of Pennant Hills, has always believed that God cares about him, and has a special Plan for his life. On the evidence to date, however, God’s design for his servant Miles is clearly for him to live a life of mind-numbing drudgery and ongoing, spirit-crushing failure. 




“I am at God’s disposal, and He may do with me as He pleases,” Carruthers, 43, said. “I had thought perhaps He might use me to heal the sick, or alleviate the suffering of the poor in the Third World, but apparently the best use my Heavenly Father can find for me in the whole splendour of His creation is to process invoices at an auto-parts supplier. Still, everything we do in this life is part of preparing for His Kingdom, and I guess I just have to conclude that my role, for reasons that He will reveal later, is to ensure that His Kingdom has adequate supplies of spark plugs.”
Carruthers has had more difficulty discerning the Lord’s plan for his family, a source of occasional doubt he has had since both his parents and sister died in a car crash at the age of nine. The tragedy resulted in him being sent to a strict Christian boarding school, where he was regularly beaten for being “a fag”, despite his near total success at overcoming his natural urges by focussing closely on the statement in Paul’s letter to the Romans that sex was created for men and women in holy matrimony. God ultimately rewarded Carruthers for his constancy with a wife, who later left him.
“The preacher talked at our wedding about the wonderful experiences that God had in store for us both,” Carruthers said. “Although he didn’t clarify that hers were mainly going to be found in her boss’ bed.”
“Reverend Jessop says he’s sure that God has someone else set aside for me, and it’s just a matter of waiting faithfully,” Carruthers affirms. “Perhaps even someone who wants me to be the biological father of her two children this time.”
Reverend Jessop says that despite his difficulties, Miles has been given one extraordinary blessing – his faith. “The depth of his belief is truly a remarkable thing,” he says. “God knows if I were him, I’d have packed it in long ago.”",NaN,"November 9, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/god-1024x578.jpg,Fake
Voters shocked to learn that Luke Foley was invited to a party ,"NSW Voters have been left reeling this morning after it was revealed that Luke Foley had been invited to a party two years ago. 




People with knowledge of the situation said that Luke Foley had always been someone who you’d “accidentally” leave off the list whenever there was a social gathering happening.
“This is a real shock. It must have been some sort of oversight. Perhaps someone was trying to be polite? It just doesn’t make any sense. I mean, why would anyone want him at a party?” said every single person who has ever met Mr Foley.
Yesterday observers were shocked to learn that the Opposition Leader had been accused of being a sex pest. “I had no idea he was opposition leader,” said one Labor insider. The Labor Party will now begin its search for the next person to lead the party into the next scandal.
Meanwhile, NSW Parliament was rocked by another revelation yesterday, when computer scientists revealed they had developed an Artificial Intelligence Robot capable of corruption and sex offenses. The new robot could wipe out the need for NSW politicians within five years.

SJW confined to bedrest after two days of ‘world-changing’ Facebook posts ,"INNER-Western Sydney resident Myron Spurge is ‘exhausted but satisfied’ after spending the past 48 hours on social media, taking on the Melbourne Cup and the US Mid-term Elections. 




From his share-house bed, Spurge claimed the successful operation began last week when he started making memes about the barbarism of the racing industry.
“First I had to find the pictures of horses, then I had to come up with some witty slogans, then I had to type them out in Impact font. Those three memes took me about two hours but it was totally worth it – although I’m now strangely desensitised to images of horse executions.
“Thank God I can save pictures for free off Google Images again.”
Then, in the aftermath of the race, Spurge was hit by the sickening realisation he had less than a day to generate some anti-Trump memes and a witty-but-sentimental 1,500 word rant to his (mainly Australian) friends.
“In the end I got 40 likes and 12 heart reactions – lucky I’d already unfriended everyone who disagrees with me. That should start a discourse and effect some change. It’s exhausting, being so moral. Now I know what a racehorse feels like – the ones that don’t get shot I mean.”
While Spurge is taking a hiatus from social media activism for the remainder of the year, he has assured his plethora of fans that he’ll be back with some ‘truly fire’ Change-The-Date memes just in time for Australia Day.",NaN,"November 8, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/asleep-1024x678.jpg,Fake
Disney channel to introduce first S&M character ,"In what is being described as a first for the Disney Channel, creators of popular tween TV show Raven’s Home have today confirmed that a spinoff series, currently in the works, will feature an S&M story arc for the first time. 




Described as “groundbreaking” but “long overdue” by fans of the series, the new character is expected to tell the story of the struggles and discrimination faced by submissive leather gimps in wider society. “It’s a sad reality of America today that we still see a lot of discrimination against leather men and women,” says the Disney Channel’s head of Programming Candy Kittenfeet. “Hopefully by introducing kids to the idea that some people are into S&M, we can help end bullying and discrimination against these people, though I guess some of them are probably into that.”
However, the Channel says it was not just an altruous move on their part, with the Disney desperately attempting to stay relevant to the interests of school kids in the age of the internet. “Between Rhianna singing about bondage, twitter popularising ‘daddy’ memes, and Adam Rippon’s Oscars costume, it’s clear the Zeitgeist is currently calling out for more S&M characters,” says TV critic Mike Walter. “What’s more, market research has found that more and more of the nation’s teenagers today are throwing off the shackles of previous generations hangups about sex, and are instead embracing other, more literal, shackles. The reality is, if TV wants to compete with the internet for the attention of American teenagers, then occasionally our shows are just going to have to include the occasional bit of hardcore nudity, or at the very least some form of sadomasochism to keep people watching.”
Disney has also hit back at critics, who say that including sexualized characters in it’s TV shows is overstepping the mark. “I know a lot of people are accusing Disney of selling out its wholesome family image today,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger in an open response to critics this evening, “but we here at Disney promise you that frankly don’t give a fuck anymore. It has recently dawned on us that we make eight billion dollars a year no matter what you mouth-breathing, never satisfied bell-ends complain about, so from now on we’re going to do whatever we god damn want and you’re all just going to have to sit there and like it.”
A spokesman for Disney later apologised for Mr Iger’s remarks, clarifying that Disney actually makes closer to $9 Billion a year.",NaN,"November 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/disney-1024x588.jpg,Fake
Scott Morrison euthanised on track after fall in polls ,"THE Melbourne Cup has once again come under fire for its lack of humanity after current Prime Minister and general dip-shit Scott Morrison fell in the polls during the race, and subsequently had to be euthanised. 




Reports say that after the fall, Scott Morrison was still keen to stand in the next election, but it was clear he would never recover. Rather than have him limping around, the stewards determined the most humane course of action was to bring in the curtains.
“It was heart-breaking,” said one disturbed eyewitness. “He was such a good little earner, especially for the coal industry. He was looking healthy too, though it was hard to tell under the cap he insists on wearing everywhere nowadays.”
“We just have to accept that he’s had his run. We all know what happens in the Liberal Party once you start hobbling in the Newspolls. At least it was quick.”
It has since been revealed that all of Scott Morrison’s leadership responsibilities will now be divided amongst a syndicate made up of Peter Dutton, Tony Abbott, Barnaby Joyce and Josh Frydenberg – pending a long and drawn-out party-room battle.
Suggestions that Scott Morrison may be turned into meat pies have been slammed as “bad taste”, but many drunken punters leaving the racetrack admitted they’d be more than happy to try one.",NaN,"November 6, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/curtains.jpg,Fake
Local suit having rough time deciding between ‘protesting horse cruelty’ or ‘free office lunch’ ,"Local finance worker and full time suit wearer Joe Rotherfort has today taken a firm stand against the cruelty practiced by the horse racing industry, by momentarily pausing and considering his options before accepting the offer to join his office’s free Melbourne Cup lunch. 




“For a moment I considered taking a stand,” said Joe, who has been posting all week on social media about how terrible the race was, “but then I realised everyone else in the office is going so it’d be a bit weird to stay back here by myself. Also I really didn’t want to say no to Karen from HR, she worked really hard to organise the whole thing.”
“What I’ve decided I’ll do is I’ll just go to the lunch but half heartedly tell myself that I’ll leave before the horse race,” explained Joe, “but then when it comes to leave I’ll figure I might as well just see what happens, so we’ll just awkwardly stand there staring at the screen with no clue what’s going on because its 2018 and nobody knows the first thing about horse racing.”
“If it’s any consolation,” continued Joe, “I won’t enjoy it. Not because of the horse race mind you, just the idea of having to spend any social time with my managers is enough to ruin my day.”",NaN,"November 6, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/officeworker.jpg,Fake
Steve Smith defects to Canada permanently: “at least they know how to play cricket” ,"In a shock announcement, Steve Smith has announced that he will be staying in Canada permanently, because “at least the cricketers here know how to bat.” 




Smith will captain the Canadian cricket team, and provide them with the innovative “ball care” techniques that propelled Australia to number one under his leadership.
The announcement comes after Australia’s trouncing by South Africa in the first One Day International in Perth. The top score for Australia was made by tail-ender Nathan Coulter-Nile, who accidentally hit some runs after sneezing while the ball was bowled at him.
Cricket Australia said it was disappointed that Smith would not be returning, but they had just made a shit-ton of money from their broadcast deal, so they didn’t really care what happened anymore.
“The really good thing about the match in Perth is that nobody watched it because it was only broadcast on Fox Sports,” said one Cricket Australia representative. “Now, if only we can prevent the rest of the summer of cricket from being watched by anyone, then Australian cricket will be safe from the public outcry it deserves.”

Melbourne man visits Sydney just to point out its flaws ,"A 27 year old graphic designer from Melbourne has spent an entire weekend in Sydney pointing out its flaws. 




Tom Weldon, of Northcote, came to Sydney with the pretext of visiting his brother, but mostly to pour shit on “the most pretentious city in Australia, nay, the world”.
His brother, Brent, realised what a painful weekend he was in for when Tom arrived at his flat, draped in scarves, complaining about the heat and asked, “Is the water alright to drink here?” before sitting back satisfied and quipping, “I know the coffee isn’t, that’s for sure.”
Brent told reporters he is almost 100% sure that Tom pre-wrote that quip.
But Brent says Tom’s witty quip was just the opening salvo. Tom is reported to have spent that night quizzing bartenders on the ingredients of the local craft beer. The bartenders eventually refused him service assuming he was “Some wanker who was off his head on coke or something.”
Tom later brushed off the incident, claiming it was a result of “New South Wale’s nanny state. That would never happen under Daniel Andrews.”
On the Saturday, Brent attempted to take Tom to the beach but, being Sydney, the bus never showed. This allowed Tom to spend a full 45 minutes talking about Melbourne’s superior tram network, and bike system that allows wankers to get around the city much more efficiently.
Brent said his brother spent the rest of the weekend repeating the words, “You really don’t have much diversity between these bars?”, “Not much live music either?” and “So you do realise Melbourne is planned in a perfect grid?”
Brent said he was worried that Tom had been too Melbournised, and that he would never get back the brother he grew up with, who used to be interesting to talk to. “The thing is, Melbourne has changed Tom. He seems to be completely out of his depth in most social situations. The only time he is at ease is when he is sitting on a crate, in a dusty alleyway complaining about something.”
Tom said that he hadn’t enjoyed his trip to Sydney. Brent said he hadn’t enjoyed Tom’s trip either, but the one thing they could both agree on was that at least neither of them lived in Brisbane.",NaN,"November 2, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/melb-1024x683.jpg,Fake
“I don’t like Halloween because it’s American” says man blasting rock in his Ford on the way to Maccas ,"Local wowser Brad Noble has today announced his utter distaste for the entire idea of Halloween, decrying the whole celebration as a “bloody seppo import”. Posting on the American made Facebook using his American made iPhone, Brad announced that he would simply be ignoring his doorbell should it be rung by some “brainwashed” children, and that he will instead spend the night streaming some American TV on the American streaming service Netflix via his American made HP laptop, while chowing down on some delicious American Pizza Hut pizza, in celebration of his hatred of American imports. 




“It’s just not right that Australia is getting flooded with all this overseas holiday nonsense,” says Brad whose parents immigrated to Australia from Latvia in 1982. “It’s just like how all the American food chains are pushing out all the traditional Australian kebab shops. It’s a bloody disgrace.”
“For some reason kids these days just don’t appreciate good old Australian holidays like the Queen’s Birthday, where we celebrate the birth of the German descended English woman who inherited the British monarchy, and instead they want to celebrate strange foreign holiday where they go around the neighbourhood meeting neighbours and eating chocolate. What the hell is wrong with these kids!”
Brad also pointed out that the holiday was purely a commercial invention, and is only gaining popularity because it’s being pushed by Woolworths to move more products. “Obviously it’s not just because it’s a fun thing for kids to do, why the hell would anybody do something that would bring joy to children?” asked Brad.
“If you ask me, instead of celebrating this commercial, confectionery based holidays, we should instead focus on the real, traditional holidays like Christmas and Easter, which are not in any way commercially driven or based around the consumption of chocolate.”",NaN,"November 2, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/man_car.jpg,Fake
HR woman single-handedly lowering staff morale ,"Human Relations manager Helen Wilson is using her unique personnel management skills to demotivate the staff of mid-sized accountancy firm Dockery and Son. 




Since joining the company five months ago, Wilson has organized a series of team-building days and corporate outings aimed at boosting productivity and lowering absenteeism. But the results have been only feigned enthusiasm and a sexual harassment law suit resulting from a ‘trust fall’ exercise gone wrong.
Wilson has successfully unified Dockery’s previously unmotivated employees against her
“We had a management guru come in and make us walk over hot coals – at 8 am on a Saturday morning,” said one accounts man. “It’s hard to get fired up about a mission statement when you’re hungover and missing your son’s soccer game. The only ‘team-bonding’ that got done was people bitching together about not wanting to be there.”
While the company’s last HR manager confined his activities to hiring and firings, Wilson sees herself in a more expansive role. Her office is often the site of informal but effectively compulsory chats with perplexed staff members.
Lasting up to fifteen minutes, the talks are often conducted during lunch hour, and end with Wilson presenting a company logo-embossed copy of Who Moved My Cheese? to someone with no intention of reading it.
Dockery employees also report that Wilson has become an unwelcome presence at company drinks.
“We used to be able to go out and blow off a little steam on a Thursday night. Now we’ve got fucking Helen following us around like a bad smell, droning on about how great Dockery is ‘because of the people’,” said CA Arya Sarwan. “The last thing I want at the pub is someone telling me about upward feedback forms and the ten core values of Dockery people – we go there to get away from that kind of bullshit.”
Wilson is aware that not all of her innovations have been viewed favourably, but she’s confident that she can turn things around.
“Building a can-do, exciting, think-out-side-the-box corporate culture from the ground up is never easy, and there are always a few stick-in-the-muds afraid of change. And that’s precisely why the company dragon boat championship is so important.”
In response to Wilson’s techniques, her colleagues have devised what they term “an effectiveness-oriented plan for the HR department: to re-energise Dockery around a human resources solution that will leverage us towards our goals for FY 05-06”.
They plan to ask her to resign.

Celtic tattoo a link to ancient culture of 1992 ,"Mick Orton is proud of his heritage, and isn’t afraid to show it. The former laborer sports a prominent Celtic tattoo on his shoulder as a reminder of a lost past, expressing his deep sense of connection to the culture of the early 1990s. 




Orton’s tattoo dates back to the Iron Age, and also the Heavy Metal Age
“It really speaks to me. It’s about a simpler time, man –  no internet, no flatscreens, no digital cameras – just everybody free to feel good”, he said, inadvertently quoting the 1991 hit by Rozalla.
Experts say that while full meaning of the faded, slightly misshapen knot has been lost to time, it’s believed to be related to the ritual consumption of marijuana, a practice then known as “toking billies”.
Orton, who still sports a small scar from a long-removed eyebrow ring, says he doesn’t regret getting the indelible image, even if he doesn’t fully understand it. “It looks cool, and it has a message, even if I was too wasted to remember it.”
“I think this line means ‘unbroken truth’,” he says, tracing the intricate cross with with his finger. “And this part here where its hollow means I ran out of cash to have it finished.”
Sociologist Dr Eileen Chan says the tattoo is part of a cultural identity that people yearn for. “Parts of it their society might be hard for us to understand today – like making ‘Achey Breaky Heart’ number one – but people look back at the ancient ’90s as a time when they were closer together, where people where still able to get behind a common cultural cause like Fido Dido.”
“I do think we have to be careful about token representations of that kind of living, though,” says Chan. “At least, that’s what these Chinese characters on my ankle say.”

Bumper stickers fail to free Tibet ,"In a sombre address to the UN yesterday, the Dalai Lama called on the international community to recognise that bumper sticker-based diplomacy had failed his country. 




While praising the efforts of Kombi drivers and cyclists for their dedicated support, the spiritual leader’s central message was one of disappointment. Despite claims, bumper stickers had neither “raised awareness” nor caused people to “get involved”.
“We must face the painful fact that this automotive campaign, while enlightening and colourful, has not mitigated the suffering of the Tibetan people,” he said. “These messages may have reached the hearts and minds of thousands of passing motorists, but apparently our Chinese oppressors were not among them.”
His Holiness is confident that even if the bumper stickers should fail, the Tibetan Freedom Concert will succeed
When asked about the Dalai Llama’s speech, Chinese government sources said that they were unaware of any sticker campaign, and denied persecuting Tibetans, unless they were members of Falun Gung.
Analysts say Tibet is only the latest in a long line of issues failed by bumper stickers. The concerted “NO HOWARD” drive, for example, failed in both of its stated objectives.
But not everyone is ready to abandon this avenue of negotiation. “The problem here is not that stickers don’t work,” says Jane Francetti of the Free Tibet Coalition. “It’s that too few stickers in a limited palette of colours don’t work.

Why would anyone bomb all those traitors who deserve a painful death? asks Trump in stirring speech ,"Donald Trump has delivered a stirring oration to his nation, asking why anyone would even think of bombing his political opponents, whom he hates with a violent passion.

Mr Trump said that the “terrorists” who carried out the attack had done a terrible thing. “They’re totally incompetent. Who makes a bomb that doesn’t go off? I would have made a bomb that worked, and it would have made a huge explosion and it would have been a beautiful explosion.”

Journalist fills space by identifying a false national trend ,"FROM THE CHASER ARCHIVES: January, 2004




More and more journalists across the nation are turning to fabricating national trends in order to avoid hard work, according to The Age journalist Ryan Harrison. Nebulous comparisons to the past are increasingly being used to waste column centimetres he said.
“Nebulous comparisons to the past are increasingly being used to waste column centimetres,” wrote Harrison. “Sometimes, in fact, audaciously so.”
But it’s a tendency that hasn’t simply been identified by The Age. Across the nation at The West Australian, Harrison’s friend Jenny Parks noted that as little as two occurrences of a so-called trend, no matter how poorly sourced, were usually enough to justify a lengthy article about them. She wrote in her weekly column, “The trend of journalists completely concocting fictional trends is currently sweeping Australia, from The West Australian to The Age – with an astonishing two more cases reported every day.”
Harrison related the epidemic of meaningless journalistic speculation to a parallel trend of plagiarism. “The Orlando Sentinel-Times noted last week that more and more writers were ripping off dodgy social analysis pieces from the internet when they couldn’t think of anything to write about in their columns,” he wrote.
He attributed the trend at least partially to Generation X. “The maturation of Generation X has seen society implode upon itself in an intergenerational conflict between the Xers and the Boomers, forcing us to re-examine the norms of our society and the role of truth and fiction in it,” he wrote. “Plus members of Generation X are full of shit.”
But while Harrison conceded that such a blatant space-filling device was unlikely to be used in satirical publications such as The Chaser, he warned, “Anything passes for satire these days. All you need is some ironic, self-referential twist at the end of your piece. Especially if that twist pushes you over 300 words.”",NaN,"October 26, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/laptop2.jpg,Fake
Rich trendies take up petrol sniffing: ‘So expensive it must be good’ ,"FROM THE CHASER ARCHIVES: AUGUST, 2000
SYDNEY, Wednesday: Petrol prices have hit such highs that petrol is becoming the drug of choice amongst the Sydney’s conspicuous rich. Advertising agents and wealthy executives are leaving behind their cocaine for fear that they will be seen as using a “cheap drug.” 




In these circles the price of a drug is all that matters. The more you pay for drugs the more you impress your equally shallow friends and associates. Long popular in the outback petrol prices mean that the rich are being forced to sniff petrol to impress.
“Rene Rivkin’s Embassy is usually packed with people snorting coke and dropping Es,” admits the daughter of one of Sydney’s wealthiest CEOs. “But this weekend it smelt like I had pulled into my local service station.”
The result has meant that the Federal Government has redefined fuel excise as a ‘luxury tax’ and petrol bowsers will now come with a health warning.
Gone are the cut off soft-drink bottles popular in outback towns. Today the new elite are using Champagne bottles to carry their petrol.
Most petrol distributors have been slow to pick up on the new changes in their product’s sales. However, Shell recognised early on the potential in this area and decided to keep the Federal governments one cent subsidy in an attempt to artificially inflate the price.
They also introduced product differentiation with Shell-half-lead for those execs concerned about the long term effects of lead but keen to buy the more expensive, and thus status-laden, super petrol.
The strategy has been remarkably successful. Shell petrol cans are now used by the same demographic as those who always look at their Rolex watches and BMW keyrings just in case anyone is watching.",NaN,"October 26, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2000/08/hipster_petrol.png,Fake
Stock market plunges: government blames Malcolm Turnbull ,"The Prime Minister Scott Morrison has blamed the former Prime Minister for the stock market plunged that tore through the Australian Stock Exchange today.
“The brutal truth is that if Malcolm Turnbull had stuck around and won the ballot that I won, then we wouldn’t be in this mess,” the current Prime Minister told reporters. “The instability he has created by leaving after we voted for him to leave is ruining this government. He needs to take responsibility for our actions.”
Morrison called on Malcolm to re-enter politics. “If he had any guts, he’d come back, run for Prime Minister, become Prime Minister, and then we could go back to blaming him for all the instability we’d cause trying to get rid of him again. Those were the good old days.”
Meanwhile Australia’s cricket team suffered a crushing defeat against Pakistan overnight in Dubai. Sports minister Bridget McKenzie said the loss was Malcolm Turnbull’s fault.

"Every student in Australia comes out as gay, after learning it will get them out of school ","The private school sector has been thrown into chaos today, following an announcement by Prime Minister Scott Morrison that he will support the right of religious schools to expel gay and lesbian students. The comments quickly sent shockwaves through the nation’s student populace, who have now all come out as gay in a brazen attempt to get out of class for the day. 




“I wouldn’t actually say I find men attactive,” said one such student Robbo Plant this afternoon, “so I’m not gay in the official sense of the word, but if making out with Gus here means that we can get the rest of the day off to go skate at the park instead of sitting around listening to Mrs Claxton bang on about Shakespeare, then sign me up to Mardi Gras mate.”
Asked why he would support such a barbaric and outdated piece of legislation in 2018, especially after having just held a plebiscite on the matter, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was simply upholding the fundamental right of religions to pick on defenseless children. “I’m afraid Jesus was very clear on this one,” explained Morrison. “He definitely said something about gay kids not being allowed to get an education. I can’t find the page night now, but I’m pretty sure it’s in there somewhere. Maybe up the back around where he said that locking up children in camps is a very Christian idea.”

Melbourne to build their own Opera House just so they can be smug about not putting ads on it ,"Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has today announced $150 million of state funds has been redirected from schools and hospitals, in a lastminute plan to build an exact replica of the Sydney Opera House on the shores of the Yarra River. Stating that the project was “vital infrastructure” for the state, the Premier announced that having an ad free Opera House was essential for propping up Melbourne’s superiority complex. 




Funded as part of Melbourne’s $15 billion “Being Better Than Sydney” fund, the project is expected to raise smugness levels in the nation’s arts capital to unprecedented levels.
“No matter how hard we tried, Sydney always had one-up on us culturally thanks to that blasted Opera House,” complained one bearded Melbournian sipping coffee out of a shoe in an alleyway at 2am, “but now that Sydney’s gone and turned their one remaining non-finance-related venue into a giant ad for gambling, we’re finally Australia’s cultural centre! Oh cool look a rat just stole my bagel. You don’t get that in Sydney.”
The Opera House is expected to greatly improve tourism to the state, padding out Melbourne’s otherwise lackluster list of sights – which previously included one graffiti covered wall, a low-polly copy of Eiffel tower with graphics acceleration turned off, and Melbourne’s world famous answer to the big banana – the three foot high inflatable ego.",NaN,"October 11, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/melbourne_opera_house-1024x619.jpg,Fake
Liberals announce $150 million plebiscite to decide if gay kids should be allowed in schools ,"Prime Minister of the week Scott Morrison has today boldly taken a stand on the issue of gay children attending private schools, stating that it was clear that in the modern age children of any sexuality should not be discriminated against, providing the public agrees to it in a $150 million plebiscite to be held next February. 




Stating that there was “simply no way for the government to know” if the public of Australia supported homosexuality – the government, which only last October held a multi-million dollar opinion poll on same-sex relationships, stated that is was simply impossible to be sure what people think on the issue.
“The fact is these are private businesses, and as such government is completely powerless to stop them bullying children,” announced the Prime Minister this afternoon. “I think we can all agree that the government giving the church free reign to harm children has always proven to be the best course of action.”
“And, yes, sure, some people may point out that these schools are receiving millions of dollars in public funds, meaning they’re not really private at all, or that they’re simply picking and choosing the bible passages that suit their hatred of gay people, and that if they were to enforce the bans equally on children of divorced parents, children wearing clothing of mixed fabrics, children who eat shrimp, or figs, or children who disobey their parents, then there would be no children left in the schools at all, but at the end of the day the fact is I really just don’t like gay people that much, so I’m not going to change the rules.

Sydney Opera House to be shut down following noise complains ,"The New South Wales government has today announced the indefinite closure of the Sydney Opera House, following what has been described as an “unprecedented number of complaints” from neighbouring apartments. Stating that the city would not tolerate any venues, no matter how significant, which threaten to reduce the value of the city’s real estate, the government has said that it will now be taking tenders to permanently remove and relocate the eyesore from Circular Quay. 




“We initially considered moving it to Western Sydney, along with the Powerhouse Museum, but we realised this would conflict with our plan to remove all cultural spaces from Sydney’s west by 2030,” said the Premier. “We’ve also had offers from the University of New South Wales to take the venue to compliment the monorail they bought, and Melbourne put in a $12 million bid after scoffing at the idea, though they wanted to be clear that they were only buying the Opera House ironically.”
Local residents have celebrated the closure, and say they are glad that the Opera House’s reign of terror is over at last. “Day and night it was the same thing,” says Dorris Whitmore, who moved into the neighbouring ‘Toaster’ in 2005 after inheriting a large sum of money. “The constant influx of tourists and live music has gotten so bad that I’m finding it extremely difficult to charge more than $1000 a night for my Airbnb listing on the apartment. Thank god for my five other properties, that’s all I can say.”
Asked why she even bought the apartment if she didn’t want to be next to the Opera House, Dorris says she had simply assumed the Opera House would take the neighbours’ personal daily plants into account before holding every event that required amplification. “Sure, when I moved in I did know that I was moving in next to the Opera House, it’s hard to miss, but I didn’t realise they’d be holding live music there five nights a week! I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to want to be able to experience zero decibels of noise after 5pm having moved into the thriving heart of a major city.”",NaN,"October 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/opera_house_closed.jpg,Fake
NSW Government orders Opera House to install pokies after realising it could turn a quick buck ,"NSW Premier and part time Scrabble high score Gladys Berejiklian has today won global praise from the arts community, following a decision to convert the sails of the Sydney Opera House into a giant advertising billboard for anyone with enough money to buy off Alan Jones. 




“It’s a shame that we didn’t think of this sooner,” announced the NSW Sports Minister this afternoon, “the Opera House has been sitting there all this time wasted, just a boring old white eyesore in the middle of the harbour, when it could have been repainted in all kinds of ads!”
“Why settle for white when the sails could be screaming ‘Want Longer Lasting Sex‘ in big red text? And don’t we all think the harbour would look so much better with a two story projection of Tom Waterhouse, or carrying one of those creepy zombie Steve Jobs DeRUCCI posters? Maybe we could even start showing Sky News on one of the sails, at least until they decide to interview another Nazi.”
The government has also announced that they will be selling off naming rights to the world famous performance space, with the Opera House to be renamed the Qantas Credit Union House later this month. The Jorn Utzon room will also be renamed the Alianz ANZ Telstra VIP room, in order to pay for an upgrade that will see it fitted out with pokies, Keno, and a condom machine to better match the new aesthetic of the former world heritage arts centre.
Other major landmarks around the world are reportedly planning to follow suit, with the Pyramids in Egypt to be repainted with the Toblerone Logo later this month. The statue of Christ the Redeemer will also be fitted with a loudspeaker system that will use the voice of God to announce bargains so great “you’ll think you’ve died and gone to heaven”.

Crisis deepens: ABC Chairman instructed the Honey Badger to get rid of Emily ,"The ABC Chairman has become embroiled in a widening scandal of political interference, after it was revealed that he instructed the Honey Badger to get rid of Emily, one of the final six contestants on The Bachelor.

Morrison proposes 29th February for National Indigenous Day ,"Scott Morrison has announced that the 29th February will be the day the contribution of Indigenous Australians is celebrated in this country. 




The current Prime Minister’s plan to come up with a new date to commemorate the contribution of Indigenous Australians hit a major snag yesterday, after it was revealed the Government was struggling to identify a single date that isn’t also the anniversary of an horrific massacre, death in custody or implementation of a genicidal policy towards the first Australians.
Scott Morrison was astounded to discover this morning that Indigenous Australians weren’t treated badly only on the 26th January.
“I really thought their issue was with the 26th January. That’s why I suggested having another date for them. That way, whites could keep celebrating the beginning of the genocide on Australia Day, but then Indigenous Australians could uncelebrate it in some other date. What’s so insensitive about that?”
“It’s almost like I’ve missed the point of this whole issue,” he said to journalists at Cronulla Beach, as he shrugged his shoulders that were draped with an Australian flag.

Extra $4 billion funding allows struggling private school to finally build 3rd swimming pool ,"The Australian public has been overjoyed today to hear that a small minority of elite and highly funded schools will be receiving even more public funds, after the fiscally responsible Morrison government pledged an extra $4 billion to help struggling private schools cover the cost of extending their polo runs. 




Stating that “the age of entitlement is back on” Prime Minister Scott Morrison then went on to explain that the debt disaster had miraculously solved itself, and that there was now plenty of money to splash around on things, much to the surprise of the nation’s hospitals, and public broadcasters.
“For too long private and Catholic schools have had to make do with extremely sub-par upkeep,” said a representative for St Ignatius College this afternoon. “For example, last year one of the gardeners planted petunias instead of orchids in the windowsill flower-boxes. How are children expected to learn with the infrastructure around them crumbling like that?”
Public school teachers have also celebrated the funding boost, stating that they were glad to see that public money wasn’t simply being frittered away on the country’s poor and needy, on which better education would simply be wasted. “I’ve always said those ornate sandstone private and Catholic schools clearly need extra money,” said local public school teacher Mr Pleb. “It’s only fair given the longer holidays the teachers enjoy. Plus all their air conditioned classrooms don’t pay for themselves, you know?”
Despite criticism that the money could have been better spent improving the country’s underfunded public schools, instead of propping up already overfunded private schools, lobbyists for the private sector say that the $1.2 billion slush fund will actually save the taxpayer money. “If funding were cut from private schools then they would be forced to raise fees for parents in order to afford to keep paying for essentials like manicuring their lawns with nail clippers every week,” said a representative for the Catholic church this afternoon.
“Those extra charges would no doubt force parents to send their children to public schools, which would mean the government would have to start spending money on improving public schools! Obviously that would be a huge waste of funds.”
The government also went to great lengths to point out that the funding increase was only put in place to help transition private schools onto the new funding model, where they would be receiving less money. “By giving these schools more money, we have successfully offset any issues that would have arisen from them receiving less money.” explained Morrison. “It will also help tide the schools over until the guaranteed 3% funding increase outstrips the 1-2% inflation rate, meaning these schools will be right back on their regular funding levels by the time the transition has kicked in. In fact by 2050 the will almost certainly be making substantially more from this new ‘lower funding’ model. It’s actually quite ingenious.”",NaN,"September 20, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/private_school-1024x600.jpg,Fake

Royal Commission into aged care to focus on “how the hell to get rid of Four Corners” ,"Scott Morrison has urgently announced a Royal Commission into aged care facilities, ahead of tonight’s explosive Four Corner’s episode which investigates systemic underfunding of the sector. 




“This really is a tragic situation. We can’t let this go on. You’d think that with all our cuts to the ABC, we wouldn’t have this problem,” said Mr Morrison.
The revelations are a major political embarrassment for the current (as at 11:24am on 17/9/18) Prime Minister, because he was personally responsible for cutting $2 billion out of aged care when he became Treasurer in 2015. 
Mr Morrison said it was important for the Royal Commission to investigate fully how the chronic underfunding of aged care could be brought to light so easily. 
“The ABC has a lot to answer for here. The whole deal with Aged Care is that you put them into these homes, and then you don’t have to think about your parents anymore. Doesn’t Four Corners understand that if that can be done more cheaply, then that’s a good thing?”
Insiders say that Bronwyn Bishop is tipped to be appointed the Commissioner for the inquiry, given her track record at overseeing scandals in Aged Care facilities. The Chaser tried to reach her for comment, but she was busy having a kerosene bath.

"Morrison sets target for Liberal Party to have 50% women, 75% men ","The current Prime Minister Scott Morrison (as at 9:07am on 17 September 2018) has set an ambitious target of 50% women and 75% men in the parliamentary Liberal Party. 




“We want more women because it looks better on TV when there are a few chicks behind me during question time,” said the Prime Minister.
Mr Morrison said that there were a lot of women in Australia. “They’re everywhere,” he said. “In fact, I’ve seen figures that suggest they’re actually half the population. I know it sounds a bit high – you just don’t come across anywhere near that many of them when you’re in a cabinet meeting, or meeting with CEOs, but I’ve been told they do exist.”
But Mr Morrison warned that letting women get seats in parliament would mean that the “best candidates” would be left out.
He pointed to Wentworth as an example of the problems with pre-selecting women. “I thought the seat was probably unwinnable, so I suggested that a woman should run for it. But then Dave Sharma puts up his hand, and he’s clearly the best candidate because he’s not a woman.”
Mr Morrison said he had therefore come up with a perfect solution: aim for 50% of MPs to be women, but set a quota of at least 75% of MPs to be men as a reflection of the fact that they are the “best candidates”. 
“I can’t see any problem with that,” he said. ",NaN,"September 17, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Scott_morrison_1flip-horz.jpg,Fake

“We’ve learned a lot from last year’s Halloween scare,” said a spokesman from the company this afternoon. “After we discovered that some unethical individuals were spiking children’s razor bags with black-liquorice we’ve taken great strides to ensure that all sales of unwanted confectionery items, from hershy’s to cherry ripes, are logged and monitored by staff.”",NaN,"September 12, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/candy_bananas.jpg,Fake
Socially responsible redneck switches to hybrid monster truck ,"Jerome “Red” Fox, Jr, is trading in his diesel-fueled juggernaut for a mammoth, semi-electric super truck. “In my job, the dangers we face are very real. But no death-dealing machine has terrified me as much as the threat we face from climate change – hell, that’s a demolition derby for the planet,” he said. 




“Beast-A-Tron and I shared a lot of good memories, but in the end, I can’t be responsible for any more of the the “car-nage” he did to the planet.”
Fox’s new machine, an 8 tonne, lithium-ion battery-powered monstrosity dubbed “Globezilla”, boasts giant horns made from recycled wicker, a giant skull decal rendered in non-polluting paint, and a flame-thrower that burns low-pollution natural gas.
“The mileage on it is unbelievable”, says Fox. “I can crush dozens of cars on half a tank of gas, and still have enough left over to crash into a school bus. It’s all carbon neutral, unless you count the thousands of tons of twisted metal I leave in my wake.”
He does admit there are some changes that take getting used to. “It is real quiet,” says the seasoned driver. “I’m used to having that roar underneath me, but all I can hear is now is rending metal and hooting rednecks, and that’s going to take some getting used to. The difference now is those rednecks are hollering for climate change.”
Many experts blame monster truck manufacturers for letting gas-guzzling behemoths dominate the monster truck circuit for too long. “Something could have been done years ago,” says “Skeet” Johnson, maker of the controversial documentary Who Killed the Electric Monster Truck? “Instead, the big companies started making monster SUVs.”
Fox admits there is much more work to be done to reduce his sport’s contribution to global warming. He has recently asked novelty drivers in the Dunny Derby to consider trading their Port-A-Loos for environmentally sustainable eco-potties, and says that wind and solar-powered monster trucks may be the way of the future.

Dutton dismissed the latest allegations, saying that he was more focused on important matters, such as counting the votes for another leadership ballot in the party room.
Despite being three votes short last time, Dutton has assured colleagues he can probably get enough votes in the partyroom. “I’m pretty sure,” he told colleagues this morning. “I’m certainly certain enough to call another spill. Which I’ll totally win. I think.”
Dutton’s boost in fortunes come despite two weeks of non-stop revelations about Mr Dutton’s improper use of his ministerial powers of discretion to help Liberal Party donors get au pairs from European countries in to Australia on tourist visas. Refusing to address the latest allegations, Mr Dutton said that the allegations were only relevant if you were interested in the proper running of government, which he had no interest in.
Dutton did admit he had a creeping feeling that someone was trying to bring him down.
“I know it’s hard to believe, but I wonder whether someone doesn’t want me sticking around in parliament, waiting for the right opportunity to run for Prime Minister again.”
“It could be anyone. Literally anyone. But I’m sure I can still count on their support in the party room.”",NaN,"September 11, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/10221914-16x9-700x394.jpg,Fake
Inner-city resident isn’t hosting a podcast ,"An inner-city man was located today who is not hosting a podcast series. Jarrod McIntyre, 32, of Darlinghurst, said he had considered a few ideas, and even discussed one of them with a friend who once nearly got into an audio production course at AFTRS. But the duo ultimately decided not to proceed with the project, tentatively titled The Poddy Poddy Podcast Podcast. 




McIntyre is disappointed to be the only resident of Australia’s inner-city areas who isn’t hosting a podcast, but says it’s “just one of those things. Maybe I should do a podcast about it?”
“I did host a podcast last year called An Unsolved Murder of Unspeakable Pain, but after 183 episodes, we found out the victim was still alive,” McIntyre explained. “I was so angry, I could have murdered him.”
The former host’s friend Troy Werner says he can’t understand his former colleague’s indifference. “Everyone who’s anyone is hosting a podcast,” he said. “I can’t imagine what Jarrod talks about at dinner parties. I mean, besides property prices.”
Werner has spent the past six weeks working on an idea for a sitcom set in an office, which he claims to be “a bit like The Office but also not at all like The Office”.
McIntyre’s family and friends have rallied around him, offering him a small involvement in their own projects. However McIntyre has so far opted to resist all of them, including his girlfriend Tanya, who is doing a podcast about being an influencer for hair and makeup brands.
“I’m resigned to just not hosting a podcast this year,” McIntyre asked. “Besides,” he added, “it’s a great chance to finish writing the novel I’ve almost started.”",NaN,"September 11, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2002/12/man-working-on-laptop-at-home_23-2147689479.jpg,Fake
Liberal Party delivers 40th successive Newspoll win for coal industry ,"The Liberal Party has delivered its 40th successive win for the coal industry, according to Newspoll figures released today.
Despite polls indicating 85% of Australians want more action on climate change, the Liberal Party held firm on its electorally disastrous policy supporting the dying industry.
“Look, even we’re surprised by the Liberal Party’s willingness to deliver for us,” said a spokesperson for the Minerals Council of Australia. “We’d never planned to have this many wins in a row. It’s almost as if they’d prefer to take our donations than win the election.”
The latest Newspoll figures out today shows the Government trailing the Labor Party by 12 points on a two-party preferred basis. But a spokesperson for the coal industry said they weren’t too concerned with a change in government. “Let’s face it, the Labor Party are always pretty disappointing once they get in anyway,” said one coal mining executive. “Besides, if they do try anything, we’ll just run a TV ad campaign against them. It worked last time. The Labor Party are terrified of television commercials.”

"New anonymous op-ed claims Trump is “total genius”, “really smart” and “I’m fantastic” ","The New York Times has published a second anonymous op-ed piece by a “senior White House official” that paints a very different picture of the inner workings of the Trump administration. 




The op-ed claims that Donald Trump is “one of the hardest working Presidents in modern history and probably in the whole of history.” It goes onto claim that he gets into work at 6am and doesn’t leave until at least 8pm. “Donald Trump is a total hard-working genius, much better than Obama and even better than Lincoln. I would say he’s the best. Definitely better than Hillary, who was a total dud. I should have locked her up.”
It also documents says Trump is “fantastic” at golf, often hitting holes in one, that he donates lots of money to “really, really great causes”, and that women love him in the bedroom.
The “senior White House official” goes on to claims that the original anonymous op-ed was “fake news”, “a total fabrication” and obviously done by a “total sleazebag”. “Whoever wrote that editorial, under the veil of anonymity was a coward. The New York Times should never let people publish anonymous opinion pieces,” the anonymous author says. “Anything said against Trump is a lie.

"Woolies to trial “just walk out” checkout, also known as “stealing” ","Supermarket giant Woolworths has announced it is trialling a high-tech checkout system at its Double Bay store, where customers just walk out with their groceries, without the bother of going through a conventional checkout. 




But critics say the system has existed for years and there is nothing innovative about it.
“I haven’t used the checkout for years,” said Keith Belan, an ice dealer from the Central Coast. “And I don’t even need an app. I just walk out.”
Woolworth’s system will require customers to scan their products on their mobile phones as they walk around the store. But Mr Belan said it was easier to just stick the goods down your underpants. “They never check there. Especially if you haven’t washed in a couple of weeks.”
The Chaser talked to one participant in the Double Bay trial, Jenny Graham, who said, “I honestly didn’t know these were vine-ripened tomatoes. I though they were just normal tomatoes. That’s why I scanned in the wrong code. Oh, and I have no idea why these avocados have been scanned in as potatoes thus saving me $8. It must have been an innocent mistake.”
The Australian Shoplifters Association says it is hoping for a nationwide rollout of the new system in time for Christmas.
“It’ll certainly make getting the frozen Turkey out of the store a lot easier,” said Mr Belan.

Sydney Airport customs launches express lane for “people with no personal connection to Peter Dutton” ,"Home Au Pairs minister Peter Dutton is under renewed pressure after it was revealed there is a special express lane at Sydney airport customs reserved for “people with no personal connection to Peter Dutton”. 




According to Border Force insiders, the visa category of people who have “no personal connection” to Peter Dutton is one of the most popular visas and has been used by one-third of France.
People who have used the express lane say it all you have to do is reassure Border Force officials that you “don’t know Peter”, wink at them, then show them your European passport and a receipt for a donation to the Liberal party.  
Meanwhile, Peter Dutton has clarified comments he made to parliament about the issue, after claims he misled the chamber.

"“Religion has no place in legal system” says Catholic church, 12 months after bankrolling ‘No’ campaign ","The Catholic Church has spoken out this week, to strongly condemn a proposal by the Australian government to legally compel priests to report paedophilia to police. Stating that there needs to be a clear and respected line between the Church and Australia’s legal system, church leaders then went on to explain that they had suddenly come down with amnesia and are completely incapable of remembering a single thing that the Church said or did last year. 




When it was pointed out by journalists that the Church had in fact bankrolled a very large and divisive campaign only twelve months earlier seeking to codify the religion’s beliefs into the nation’s laws, Church officials said they were shocked and surprised at the revelation.
“That doesn’t sound like something we’d do,” said Catholic archbishop George Pell, via a secure Skype connection from the Vatican. “No we’ve always been clear that the Church should exist separate and apart from the laws of Australia. That’s why we went to great lengths to clarify to the public that religious marriage was actually a separate ritual from civil marriage. Doesn’t anyone remember that?”
Pell also sought to dispel fears that the Church is incapable of dealing with the issue of paedophilia on their own. “Given our track record on dealing with paedophiles, I think we can be trusted.” explained Pell, in between furiously shredding papers marked Official Church Paedophile Coverup Instructions. “You can rely on us, if any child reports anything out of order, we’ll see that the child is punished accordingly.”
Pell also explained that it was completely against the teachings of Jesus for priests to seek to protect vulnerable children. “It says it right there in the bible in black and white ‘And the lord said unto his followers, it’s more important to not reveal what is said in a fancy wooden box than to protect and shelter children from harm. So says, I your lord and saviour – Jesus H Christ. P.S. also I don’t like refugees’.“
Pell also went on to explain that creating laws that required priests to report child abuse was a waste of time, as it would only lead to the problem to being deal with in an appropriate manner. “The Church doesn’t believe in making any laws to combat paedophilia,” explained Pell. “Sure we may have run a large campaign in the 80s claiming we shouldn’t make homosexuality legal because it would lead to paedophilia being legalised, but that was in the olden days and we’ve learned a lot from out past mistakes. These days we’ve learned how to condemn gays without smearing the good names of paedophiles, many of whom are our friends and colleagues.”",NaN,"September 1, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/church_conference-1024x577.jpg,Fake
Boatload of au pairs spotted off the coast of Australia ,"Australia is at risk of being swamped by au pairs after a boatload of them was spotted in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia. 




The boat was intercepted by Border Force and taken to Christmas Island, where they immediately started singing wholesome Christmas Carols and organised a Kris Kringle for the locals.
The surge in au pair arrivals has coincided with revelations that former Immigration Minister Peter Dutton is soft on nanny arrivals.
But critics say Australia is at risk of becoming a nanny state. They fear the au pairs will overwhelm Australia’s already stretched infrastructure.
“These French au pairs are teaching our kids different customs, different languages. Next they’ll be trying to introduce our kids to French cinema. I mean — do we really want a whole generation of wankers?”
Pauline Hanson also slammed the surge in au pair arrivals. “I’ve heard reports that they’re forcing our kids to eat a wider range of soft cheeses,” Ms Hanson said, “I sorry, but what’s wrong with Kraft Singles?”
Facing mounting pressure, Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed to crack down on the latest boat arrivals, saying the real problem was the au pair smugglers. Officials said the boat appeared to be organised by a notorious smuggler Fran Drescher, who they say is known to authorities.
Locals on Christmas Island say the arrivals are not welcome. “We resent having to eat all our vegetables before we can have dessert each night.”",NaN,"August 31, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/refugeeboat-of-nanies2.jpg,Fake
"Jesus would have locked up kids in offshore prison camps, claims Morrison ","Scott Morrison has slammed claims he only invokes his Christianity selectively, saying that all of his government’s policies are endorsed by Jesus. “Jesus would have locked up refugee kids in offshore prison camps if he’d only had the chance,” he told reporters. 




“A lot of people think of Jesus as some softy, but Jesus would have loved seeing kids as young as twelve catatonic and suicidal. He was just that sort of guy,” he said. “But you can’t question that because that’s my Christianity, which is very personal to me.”
The comments come after the ABC-TV’s Tonightly show ran a comedy song making fun of the fact that Morrison claims he’s a Christian while his government denies medical care to refugee children. “We love Jesus, Jesus, but not refugees-us,” the song proclaimed.
But Morrison hit back at claims that his Christianity was a fig-leaf that he used for only some issues. “You can’t say that I selectively use Christianity because any criticism of my belief is a gross breach of religious freedom,” he said.
He went on to say that the ABC should be ashamed of itself. “Jesus clearly said that the ABC should have less critical voices in its TV programming. It’s right there in the bible. But don’t ask any questions about that because it’ll breach my freedom.”
Earlier, Morrison was accused of using the bible to justify his opposition to marriage equality, while ignoring Christian values in the rest of his policy agenda. But the Prime Minister said that was rubbish.
“If you look at the bible closely,” the Prime Minister told journalists, “it was very clear that Jesus wanted to stop the boats. Also, the Bible clearly states that Jesus preached for the scraping of the Paris Climate Accord, a commitment to lower electricity prices and lower taxes for businesses with revenue under $50 million. It’s right there in the bible,” he claimed. “But you can’t question me on that because it’s my religious belief, and questioning me is an outrageous attack on religious freedom.”",NaN,"August 30, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jesusrebel.jpeg,Fake

Morrison under pressure to quit after losing 100% of Newspolls in a row ,"The Liberal Party is under pressure to shake up its leadership position after a disastrous Newspoll shows Prime Minister Scott Morrison behind 44% to 56% – facing electoral wipeout at the next election. 




“Scott Morrison has now lost 100% of Newspolls in a row,” quipped one backbencher who refused to be named as he came out of the surf in red budgie-smugglers outside Manly Surf Club this morning.
The Hard Right of the party is still unconvinced that the Prime Minister is supportive enough of the coal industry, despite photos of him taking an actual piece of coal into Question Time earlier this year. “Only if he brings a whole shipping container of coal into parliament, and then sets up an actual furnace inside the chamber, and uses it to create electricity, will we trust him on this. Anything less is pandering to the extremist left.”

Liberal party unanimously elect Alan Jones leader after hearing him use N-word on air ,"The national Liberal party has today abandoned plans for a second leadership spill to decide which out-of-touch psychopath would become the next leader of Australia. Gathering in Canberra this afternoon, the party room is reported to have instead unanimously decided to simply hand the party’s leadership to radio personality Alan Jones, following reports that he had used the N-word on air. 




“When we sat down to decide who our next leader was earlier this week, we thought we’d never find someone more objectionable than Peter Dutton,” said one party room insider this afternoon. “Little did we know there was someone even more adept at race-baiting, even more capable of saying wildly offensive things in front of microphones, and someone even more shockingly out of touch with every value modern Australia holds dear, right under our noses the whole time.”
“In retrospect thought, it’s the perfect choice,” he continued. “His fanbase is entirely angry old white people, he doesn’t believe in climate change, and he’s repeatedly taken large sums of money from businesses to change his opinion on a topic. He literally checks every box for a modern Liberal Party candidate.”
Jones says that he has been humbled by the nomination, and that he will seek to use his newfound platform to return the country to the values of the “good old days”, when women were regularly beaten, black people weren’t considered people, and homosexual radio hosts would be forced to remain closeted for fear of offending the sensibilities of their largely conservative elderly listenership.

NBN boss blames slow speeds on everyone refreshing their browser to check who’s Prime Minister ,"The head of NBN Co Bill Morrow has today issued a public statement begging Australians to stop refreshing their news feeds every five seconds to check who the Prime Minister is, stating that the national internet network was facing “unprecedented strain” from the influx of traffic. 




“The fact is the NBN was never designed to deal with this amount of use.” said Mr Morrow “Our original modelling had predicted maybe three, at most five people using the country’s internet at any given time – we never imagined for a second that everyone would be wanting to use it at once.”
Speaking with ABC news via Skype this afternoon, Morrow also sought to play down claims that the NBN had been hobbled by the Liberal Party’s shortsighted attempts to cut costs. “Fibre to the node is a p— erfect ly acce— pt -a -ble alt– er– wait— he– lo?

A spokesperson said the infographic will be available for all Australians on the NBN website, “as soon as it’s finished uploading.”

Second spill imminent: Dutton running as the lack-of-consensus candidate ,"Peter Dutton announced he would put himself forward on Thursday morning as the lack-of-consensus candidate in yet another leadership spill of the Liberal party room.  




This comes after rumours started spreading that a consensus candidate, such as Julie Bishop, may run in order to stifle Dutton’s bid to lead them to a crushing defeat at the next election.
The move comes as Dutton furiously hit the phones earlier in the day, trying to build numbers against incumbent Malcolm Turnbull. However, he changed course in the afternoon after he noticed that the more people he called, the fewer votes he had.
“In hindsight, not talking to anyone before the first ballot was a stroke of genius. It explains why so many MPs voted for me. As long as I don’t chat to anyone, I might just be able to hold onto enough votes to win,” said Mr Dutton.
Mr Dutton said that if there was one person who would be able to reach a lack-of-consensus in the Liberal Party, and disunite the nation, it was him. 
The move comes despite Mr Dutton being under a cloud. But supporters dismissed concerns, saying he’s under a cloud because potatoes need rain to grow.
Meanwhile, rumours that Scott Morrison is thinking of putting himself forward as a consensus candidate have been dismissed by party insiders. “The idea that Scott Morrison can think is preposterous,” one insider told The Chaser. “There’s certainly consensus around that.”
International observers have been shocked that another leadership spill would be happening so soon after Tuesday’s ballot, but Australian voters have come to know the occasion as “Thursday”. ",NaN,"August 22, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/C659406D-EC61-4232-81E5-C263E6C0EC8C.jpeg,Fake

"Breaking: Dutton unfit for parliament, also may have broken constitution ","Former Queensland traffic warden, Peter Dutton’s political career is in turmoil tonight after documents came to light casting doubts on whether he can sit in parliament.  




The documents are based on his record as a minister since 2013, and clearly show a man with callous disregard for Australia’s international Human Rights obligations, and a savage use of racial division for political ends. The documents reveal a long history of locking up innocent people in cages for years on end without regard for their well-being or legal rights. 
Lawyers said that it was clear that Peter Dutton was unfit to sit in parliament. “In any civilised nation, the actions he’s taken since 2013 would see him shunned from high office,” said one expert.
Instead, the documents were being studied by the Australian Labor Party to see how closely they can copy Dutton without anyone noticing. 
Meanwhile, Peter Dutton was also revealed to be in breach of the constitution, after he benefited financially from government payments to childcare centres he owns. If found in breach, he would face severe consequences and lose his seat immediately.

Malcolm Turnbull removes spine in fresh bid to save leadership ,"Liberal leader Malcom Turnbull has taken drastic action to sure up his Prime Ministership today, in the face of renewed challenges from the right wing of his party. Calling a press conference this afternoon, Turnbull gave what is being described as one of the greatest speeches by a Prime Minister in living memory, before impressing onlookers by furiously backpeddaling his way out of the building. 




Stating that “Now is the time for action on climate change, in order to ensure that our children’s children do not needlessly suffer due to our actions today,” Mr Turnbull bravely announced that the nation’s climate targets were an issue he is willing to lose his Prime Ministership over, before backing down, giving a tax-break to coal miners, and then dropping by a nearby hospital to remove the pesky spine he had been suffering from.
“It was the brave, sensible, logical thing to do,” said Turnbull, on the decision to remove a vital organ from his body. “Sure, there may be serious future consequences flowing from this decision, possibly even extreme suffering and hardship which could have easily been prevented, but that’s a problem for another day, and the important thing is I kept my job for a few more weeks.”
“Besides,” continued Turnbull, “while 96% of scientists might claim that it’s ‘extremely dangerous’ to have your spine removed, Tony Abbott assures me that a friend of a friend of a mining lobbyist once told him that there was absolutely no risk whatsoever in having all your vertebrae replaced with a large steel beam, so who could say what the truth really is?”
Turnbull also went to great lengths to explain that it had always been his position that he didn’t need a spine. “I never liked my spine,” said Turnbull, only hours after having praised his spine as being one of his best features. “All it’s ever done for me is get in the way of my ambition to be in power at all costs. Whether it be my spine forcing me to stand up to climate deniers, holding me back from conducting a public vote about a minority’s rights, or simply stopping me from bending over backwards to accommodate billionaire mining magnates, I can’t think of a single time that my spine has stood up for me and had my back.”
Asked whether he would miss his ability to walk, stand or even care for himself, Mr Turnbull told reporters that there has never been a more exciting time to be a paraplegic. “The fact is, this has been my dream since I was a small child,” said Turnbull, “to one day be in a position of power where I could change things for the better, but wouldn’t for fear of angering a small group of loonies on the fringes of political opinion.”
However members of Turnbull’s faction have expressed doubts about whether permanently crippling himself will be enough to win over those on the far-right of his party. “The fact is, if Turnbull wants to win over the right, he’s going to need to do more than just give the occasional tax break to a millionaire,” said Tony Abbott on the condition of anonymity. “No, if he wants to play in the big leagues he’s going to have to do something much more impressive. Maybe boycott an apology about genocide, fabricate a story about gangs of black people terrorising a major city, or even just fashion his head into more of a vegetable-like shape. You know, just drop his hair and go crazy.”
“If there’s one thing we’ve learned from our time in office,” said another party insider, “from Tony Abbott’s disastrous polling against Bill Shorten, to Malcolm Turnbull’s disastrous polling against Bill Shorten – it’s clear that what Australia really wants is a more right wing Prime Minister. And with Dutton’s stunning public approval rating of 3%, it’s clear he’s the yam for the job.”

"Toyota to phase out indicators on all new vehicles, citing lack of use ","The Toyota Corporation of Japan has today caused shockwaves throughout the automotive industry, after CEO and president Akio Toyoda announced to shareholders that the car company will be phasing out indicators on all future vehicles – stating that they have clearly become redundant. 




“The fact is, only a tiny fraction of drivers are using them,” said Toyoda, in his quarterly report to the company. “Just take a five minute drive through any major metropolitan city and you’ll see that the indicator has become an antiquated vestigial of a simpler, less asshole-filled time.”
“Instead,” Toyoda explained, “modern motorists have been forced to develop a kind of ‘sixth sense’ for when other motorists may be merging into their lane. A light tap on the brakes by the car ahead, or the telltale swerves of someone checking their side mirror, these have taken the place of the old clunky system in which a motorist uses a clear flashing light in order to avoid causing a fatal collision.”
Toyoda also pointed to recent surveys, which have found that a majority of drivers on the road consider indicators to be little more than an inconvenience, with respondents complaining of fatigue and exhaustion that result from having to slightly lift their hand off the wheel from time to time. “The occasional death on the road is a small price to pay if it means not having to go to all that effort of flicking a small plastic switch with my finger,” said one respondent. “Not to mention the mental toll of having to remember to switch it off again once I’ve completed making my turn.”
“Are you telling me I’m supposed to be watching the road, sending texts, eating food AND remembering to indicate, all at the same time? What am I, the rainman?”

Fraser Anning picks up job as Sky News presenter ,"Bob Katter’s Australia Senator Fraser Anning says he has never heard of the Nazi Party, despite claims he was seen goose stepping down the street in a full SS uniform yesterday. 




The Senator claimed that he was simply stretching his legs. “Um, exercise. I love the outdoors you see, lots of Lebensraum.”
The claims come after he talked about banning Muslims using the phrase “Final Solution.”
But Anning dismissed criticisms he was aping Nazi sentiment. “No, it’s leftist nonsense, mostly from the Labor camp. And if you disagree, I will send you TO a labor camp!”
Despite calls for Anning to resign, Anning says he’s not going anywhere “I retain the full support of all 19 people who voted for me in the Federal Election.”
“Besides,” he said, “I’ve just been offered a regular job on Sky News.”

World celebrates progress as Hollywood casts black man to play violent gun-wielding murderer ,"Progressives across the world have taken to social media this week to celebrate rumours that British actor Idris Elba has been tapped to play James Bond in an upcoming James Bond film. Stating that it was a “milestone moment” in the history of cinema, fans of Elba say that it is heartwarming to see Hollywood finally opening the doors to black men when casting roles about violent gun-wielding murderers. 




“For too long people of colour have been relegated to token typecast characters, like the NASA mathematician in Hidden Figures, or the bullied teenage homosexual of Moonlight,” said one fan of Elba on twitter today. “I’m glad we are finally getting a chance to see people of colour explore more nuanced and humanised characters, such as an alcoholic gun-for-hire with multiple girlfriends who rides around in a souped-up car.”
However, the news of Elba’s casting has caused upset with some fans of the Bond franchise, who say that the producers are wrong to waver from how Ian Flemming described Bond in the original books. “It’d be different if the character was open to interpretation, but James Bond was very clearly described in the books – as a Scottish man with brown eyes and black hair,” complained one fan online. “As such it just doesn’t make sense to have a black man play the role. No, only blond English men with blue eyes like Daniel Craig are suitable to play such a clearly defined character. Him and George Lazenby. I mean, Flemming never said anything about Bond NOT having an Australian accent, did he?”
Despite the blowback, producer Barbara Broccoli says she is not worried about these critics, stating that she is sure that fans will change their minds once they see Elba on screen. “I think people will quickly come to realise that he is just as capable as Roger Moore or Daniel Craig at never quite living up to people’s wildly high expectations of what a James Bond film should be,” says Barbara. “Once they see the flaming hot mess of jumbled plotlines, stilted dialogue, and hamfisted plot twists that we have in store for Bond’s next outing, they’ll quickly realise that Elba’s Bond is still the same old misogynistic throwback that we’ve all learned to tolerate over the last fourty-odd something rehashes of the exact same plotline.”",NaN,"August 15, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/elba-1024x600.jpg,Fake
Victoria to introduce involuntary euthanasia for families that walk side-by-side on footpath ,"The Victorian government has surged in approval ratings today, following an announcement by Premier Daniel Andrews that the state would be allowing euthanasia for all families who walk side-by-side down the footpath. 




“Frankly it’s the humane thing to do,” announced Andrews at a press conference earlier today, “to end the protracted pain and suffering of millions of pedestrians, by taking these gumbies out of the gene pool once and for all.”
Though the government will not be passing any new legislation to legalise these killings, Andrews says that the Attorney General found that they were still perfectly legal under existing euthanasia laws. “It’s been longstanding practice that doctors are allowed to end the lives of anyone who shows little to no cognitive activity, and I think we can all agree these footpath fleshwalls are as braindead as they come.”
Responding to concerns from parents groups, Premier Andrews stressed that the plan would only apply to those who walked in a blocking line across the footpath, and not those that walked back to back. “We’ve got nothing against single file families, except for the ones that walk on the right, against the flow of traffic. They’re on thin ice.”
However, despite the policy’s popularity with anyone who has ever tried to walk through the city, the plan is not without its critics, with many conservative religious groups warning that Victoria is on a slippery slope towards legalising all sorts of killings, if the plan is enacted.
“Sure, we’re all on board with taking out those idiotic side-walkers, but where do we draw the line?” asked Reverend John Hope, leader of Choose Life Ministries. “If we do that, what’s to stop us also killing off slow walkers? Or what about couples who walk hand-in-hand down a busy street? Or people who text and walk, careening wildly across the footpath with every step? What about the Uber-Eats cyclists ride down the footpath at 100 kilometres an hour? Will we start killing them, and the people who suddenly stop walking when there’s a crowd of pedestrians behind them? All I can say is I sure hope we do. All these fuckers need to die.”",NaN,"August 13, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/family_blocking.jpg,Fake
City2Surf entrant hopes 2 minutes of stretches will make up for last 7 years of inactivity ,"Local City2Surf entrant and part-time sedentary blob Rick Morrow has today rolled out of bed on a freezing cold Sunday morning in order to partake a 14 kilometre race that he has done absolutely no training for – all in the name of fun. 




“I definitely do not regret every life decision I have made leading up to this point,” said Rick through gritted teeth as he pulled on his unbroken-in sneakers for the first time, “and I really cannot wait to get out there in the blazing sun and run off this crippling hangover I have from being out till 2am last night.”
“I also certainly don’t regret eating that kebab. I’m sure it will be just as enjoyable the second time round at 8am.”
Asked why he thought it was a good idea to enter himself in a fun run given his complete lack of physical exercise in the preceeding seven years, Rick says that he had naievely believed that the prospect of having to partake in such a gruelling physical feat would have been more than enough motivation to kick him out of his former lazy lifestyle. “Boy, was I wrong” chuckles Rick, “I really underestimated what a garbage human I really am.”
However, witnesses report that the possible heath benefits played only a minor part in Rick’s decision to jog into the fifth circle of hell. “Nah mate, the only reason he joined the fun run thing was to impress Emily from HR,” says Rick’s co-worker Robert from the comfort of his warm bed. “She came around asking all of us if we wanted to join the company’s team this year, and Rick was too much of a wuss to admit he gets asthma just walking to the break-room.”
“The good news is that it’s technically a business activity so he’ll be under the work’s insurance. That’ll probably save him a fair bit on the ambulance transport back from the finish line.”",NaN,"August 12, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/city2surf.jpg,Fake
Great Barrier Reef downgraded by scientists to “Pretty Average Barrier Reef” ,"Executives on the UNESCO World Heritage board have made a unanimous decision today, approving the motion to change the name of Australia’s world famous ‘Great Barrier Reef’ to simply the ‘Ocean’ over fears that they may be sued for false advertising. 




Prof. Douglas Ronson, a marine biologist and long time conservationist, says the move was saddening, but necessary. “I’ll admit the name Great Barrier Reef had more ring to it, but we just can’t lie to tourists anymore. At first we considered to just downgrading it to the ‘Adequate Barrier Reef’, but it turns out to legally call something a reef it actually has to have some coral left, which would have been stretching the truth a bit at this point.”
The name change was first put UNESCO’s agenda after PeroxyChem’s multi-million dollar investment in the reef’s “refurbishment”.
The CEO of PeroxyChem, Bruce Lerner,  told The Chaser that the Great Barrier Reef was looking “better than ever” now that it had finally got a nice cleaning and the minimalist white aesthetic of the reef was a pleasant change. “The fact is these days tourists tastes are a lot more refined,” said Lerner, “the whole fluro colours thing may have been great in the nineties, but I think we can all admit that the reef really was overdue for a good scrub and bleach.”
When asked for comment, the Australian Minister for the Environment and Energy, Josh Frydenberg, told The Chaser he had mixed feelings about the change. “On the one hand, the ‘Minister for the Environment’ part of me is screaming internally about the loss of one of the world’s most beautiful natural treasures, but then the ‘and Energy’ part of me thinks this is really great for our economy. Besides, it’s not like Tourism contributes that much to our economy anyway, and we’ve got plenty of other cool things for tourists to see in this country, like the Opera House and … that big rock.”",NaN,"August 11, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/turnbull.jpg,Fake

End of Crocs footwear mourned by virgins worldover ,"Fans of unflattering clothing that you shouldn’t be seen dead in are in mourning today, following news reports that the Crocs Corporation has undergone significant downsizing, following mass resignations from their board. Stating that it was “the end of an era”, the manufacturers of the once “most hated footwear in America” say they have struggled to keep that mantle since the rise of the much more hated ‘hipster toe-shoe’ in 2016. 




While the controversial footwear will still be manufactured by third party suppliers, fans of the brand say it just won’t be the same. “Do these knockoff manufacturers know how to get the size of the airholes just right for maximum fugliness?” asked one fan at a headtorch-lit vigil this afternoon. “Will they know to only pick the most garish colours to make the shoes look like they were intended for an oversized Ken-doll? And what about the all important excess space, which makes every shoe look like it was designed to fit Shrek’s feet? Those aren’t things you can just dream up in a boardroom overnight. No, it takes a certain inborn complete lack of style to come up with a product so universally unappealing in every single design choice.”
“Now what are we supposed to do with all these camo-cargo pants, AC/DC t-shirts, and pinstriped K-mart fedoras,” wept another fan, “if we can’t complete the look with a shiny new pair of fluorescent-green crocs? I can’t go back to just wearing socks with sandals anymore! God, that would be so unstylish!”",NaN,"August 10, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/crocs.jpg,Fake
Starving Africans relieved to learn that only white people experience poverty ,"Starving children across the world were relieved today to learn that they actually have it pretty good compared to many white people, after hearing that former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce had dedicated his memoir to struggling poor people who “in many instances are white”. 




Mr Joyce’s comment came in reaction to questions from the press about why he had decided to launch a tell all book about his affair, complete with a national media tour, only months after repeatedly requesting the media stop talking about his affair. “Well, it’s not a memouir about me.” explained Joyce, apparently completely misunderstaing the entire point of a memoir. “It’s a memouir about trying to look after people who are poor in many instances they’re white and we’ve got to come up with policies that take these people ahead.” said Joyce, while randomly picking words out of a hat and reading them aloud.
The comments are just the latest in the cycle of scandals that make up Mr Joyce’s life, ranging from the time Mr Joyce helped out struggling farmers by threatening to kill Johnny Depp’s dogs, to the time Joyce looked out for the average working Australian by taking a $40,000 cheque from Gina Rineheart, to the time he addressed the worries of drought stricken farmers by having an affair with a juniour employee and then denying he was the father of her child on national TV.
“I’m just glad to know there’s still someone in parliament who’s got our back,” said one drought-stricken farmer. “Baranby’s always focused on improving life for country people, you know, in between his frequent national book tour appointments that is.”
“Sure the bloke may have denied climate change while sitting in the nation’s parliament, contributing in a large way to now irreversable changes in the global climate that will cause worse periods of drought, and increased hardship for farmers in years to come, but you know he also often appears on TV wearing an accubra so it all balances out.”",NaN,"August 9, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/barnaby_hut.jpg,Fake
Turnbull takes action against the drought by putting on an akubra ,"With climate change in full swing, Turnbull has signalled his desire to take action to mitigate the drought by putting on an akubra. 




“Having ignored this issue, I want to assure farmers they will not be ignored until after the election is over,” the Prime Minister said in a plane that was flying over a drought affected farm on his way from Canberra to Sydney.
When told that 99% of NSW farms are affected by drought, Mr Turnbull suggested that they should just get a hose and water their farm. “That’s what our gardener does to our garden in Point Piper whenever it gets a bit dry. It works wonders.”
Meanwhile, business groups have swung behind the Prime Minister’s newly found concern for the drought. One consortium of well-connected businessmen have set up the Drought Relief Foundation on the off-chance that Turnbull swings them a spare half a billion dollars.

"“Refugees are going to take my job,” claims unemployed man ","Local man Gareth Jones has voiced his outrage in his local pub that “Refugees are going to take my job. That’s it for me my careers well and truly done.” 




Jones had been talking about becoming an architect for several decades now, but has decided instead to double down on his current occupation of yelling at his TV and listening to talk back radio.
Jones defined “The time I saw a woman wearing a burka thingy in the audience of re-runs of The Chase,” as the seminal moment when he realised that the Australian way of life was doomed forever.
“There’s no point really going for jobs anymore since, some immigrant is going to come in with a better fake resume than me, and mines a pretty good resume as far as they goes.”
In a display of peaceful protest Jones has decided to live off government welfare and go fishing for the rest of his working life, “To stick it to the government that wronged him and his people.”
Mr Jones also said that refugees would destroy simple pleasures of Australian life.
“We’ll end up with those disgusting squatting toilets everywhere. Imagine walking into the men’s toilet and it smelling terrible. It’ll totally change our way of life,” said Mr Jones, who last aimed correctly at a urinal in 1993.

Kate McClymont appointed Senior Instagram Correspondent following Fairfax-Nine merger ,"The once-great television network Nine announced today that it would swallow up the once-great print empire Fairfax, which, reflecting the relative importance of each company, will be called ‘Nine’.
Demonstrating its commitment to reporting the facts rather than spin, the press release described what is obviously a takeover as a merger.
CEO Hugh Marks spoke enthusiastically about the new opportunities for the legacy newspapers, the most famous of which will be renamed the Sydney Morning 9Honey.
“The new SM9H will be Australia’s premier destination for compelling lifestyle content compiled by Peter Hartcher, the most shareable viral videos chosen by Ross Gittins, and a roundup of today’s most unmissable Instagram posts edited by Kate McClymont,” Marks said.
“We’ll also bring you all the latest breaking news about what’s on tomorrow’s edition of The Today Show.”
Marks has vowed, however, to protect Domain’s lack of journalistic integrity. 
Fairfax’s Melbourne masthead will become Nine’s platform for lucrative sponsored posts about reiki and cupping, and renamed The New Age.
Nine chair Peter Costello said he had been eager to bring some of Fairfax’s famous high-quality approach to journalism to the network’s tv programmes like 60 Minutes and ACA, but that after the newspapers’ last few rounds of redundancies, they hadn’t been able to find any left.
Perhaps the most disappointing development for fans of Fairfax’s best content, however, was the announcement that Michael Leunig would continue as a cartoonist.
Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood claimed that despite the obliteration of his company’s legendary name, Fairfax’s “DNA would be all over the new company”, as happens at the scene of any murder.

Starting global wars will result in one-hour suspension under Twitter’s tough new terms of service ,"Twitter has responded to a threatening tweet posted by Donald Trump to the President of Iran by updating its terms of service. 




On Monday, Trump tweeted:
To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2018

The social media company immediately responded to concerns that the tweet breached its terms of service. “It’s come to our attention that a small percentage of users have been acting aggressively and posting offensive or dangerous content,” said a spokesperson for the company. “To them we say thank you! That’s what makes Twitter Twitter!”
But the company said it would update its terms of service to reduce the change it would be directly blamed when World War Three inevitably breaks out.
“From now on, making inflammatory threats towards a foreign adversary is a breach of content guidelines and will result in harsh penalties, namely a one hour suspension of your posting privileges,” said the spokesperson.
“Furthermore, making fun of people with disabilities, minorities and women is only acceptable if your have a blue tick next to your name.”
The spokesperson added that lying, mocking and reposting racist content from Nazis is still an integral part of the twitter experience and won’t be affected.

MyHealth data to be stored on a highly-secure state-of-the-art Commodore 64 ,"Facing mounting criticism over the security of private medical records of millions of Australians, the government has claimed the MyHealth Record website is virtually impenetrable. 




Heath Minister Greg Hunt today told reporters the website was far too unreliable for hackers to be able gain access. “Our protection is flawless: if anyone tries to gain access, they usually just end up with a 404: The Website Not Found message. You can’t get more secure than that.”
Minister Greg Hunt also announced on Thursday that the interface of MyHealth will be redesigned by the same designers who did the MyGov website. “That way, if someone does manage to gain access to your account, they won’t be able to find the information they want anyway.”
Last year, millions of health records were hacked and put up for sale on the dark web. The minister said that there was no way a hacker would be able to work out how to use the MyGov interface, effectively ensuring user’s data remains private.
The MyHealth Record opt out period has just begun. If you don’t opt out by 15th October, your medical records will automatically be saved to a national database and emailed to a News Corp journalist whenever you complain about the government.
But Mr Hunt implored people to give the government a chance to prove that it can keep your information safe online. “You can trust the Government with your data. According to the 2016 Census, all four people who managed to fill it out think government websites are reliable,” he said.
The Chaser has compiled this useful information sheet to help you choose whether to opt out, or trust your information to the same people who brought you the 2016 Census.

Scientists Announce A.I. Now Advanced Enough To Run Fish and Chips Store ,"Researchers at MIT university have today revealed that for the first time in history, Artificial Intelligence has finally reached the level where it could probably run a Fish and Chips shop by itself. 




While the scientists admit there hasn’t been any sort of testing or experimentation into the subject, they say they are confident that any robot with simple self management capabilities, a blue apron and a tendency to overcharge on potato scallops would be able to replace most owners and managers of local fish and chips shops “within one to two years”.
Robotics expert, Pat Dougherty, explained that it would be surprisingly easy to reproduce the authentic experience of bbq-sauce soaked burgers and underpaid teenagers that has come to encapsulate the modern Fish and Chips store. “While it would take time to configure the robot to achieve the right amount salt to fish ratio, commonly thought to be at 80:1, other characteristics such as, passive aggressively serving tourists, asking whether customers would like chicken salt and then just adding it anyway, or starting your own political party to protect Australian values and hate Asians, would probably be well within the current capabilities of even the most rudimentary AI.”
While critics say that there is a lot of subtle nuance to dunking fish into a large vat of boiling oil, which a robot will never be able to perfect, a taste test stand was set up outside of a Fish and Chips shop in the town of Bendalong proved otherwise, with most customers stating “they both taste equally as shit.”
The biggest differences listed by the customers was the lack of hair found in the robot made food and the lack of fish in the human made meal. Scientists say they have already begun work on a machine that will harvest hair from local barbers and hairdressers to deal with the oversight.",NaN,"July 5, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/salt_chips.jpg,Fake
Lazy sniffer dog just sits down next to any festival-goer with dreads ,"Veteran police sniffer dog and part time good-boy “Constable” Rex Barker has today revealed in an explosive interview with Sunday Night that he no longer even tries to detect the faint smell of drugs on festival goers, and rather, he just sits next to any person sporting dreads or a Tie-dye t-shirt. 




The 10 year old Labrador’s explosive claims come on the back of revelations that it is “simply too hard” to detect the smell of drugs at a modern festival given that “the overpowering smell of weed has permeated literally every surface, including the clothing of every single man, woman, and child within a five kilometre radius.”
“The fact is, I get about the same percentage of correct readings as when I actually try to smell out some drugs,” says Barker of his controversial method of targeting anyone who vaguely looks like they have a poster of Bob Marley on their bedroom wall. “Roughly 5% correct, which is actually pretty impressive given how high I normally am after sniffing so many stoners.”
“I stopped giving a shit about 3 years ago at Splendour in The Grass,” explained Barker. “Every time I picked up a whiff of something on a potential entrant they ended up being the same scraggly, white guys wearing a weed t-shirt, and walking around with their hands in their pockets. I eventually figured it’d be easier to just cut out the middleman.”
The revelations from one of the police forces’ most senior drug detection dogs has led to renewed calls to reduce the use of sniffer dogs outside music festivals, with one regular festival goer, Kevin Burrows, angrily responding, “Just because I never wash my hair, have a ratty half-beard, and am constantly wearing hoodies even in 40 degree heat, that does NOT mean that I do drugs or deal drugs, to suggest such a thing is pure discrimination! It’s going to take a lot of weed to calm me down tonight.”
Mr Burrows then walked off, not before dropping his bag where numerous small baggies of white powder fell out across the pavement.",NaN,"July 5, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dog-1024x512.jpg,Fake
Mutant Ninja Turtles now experiencing mid-life crisis ,"Two decades after they came to prominence, the one-time Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have spent their mid-thirties questioning their life choices. 




The Turtles found it difficult to cope with the death of their sensei and father-figure, Splinter, which sparked a move out of their long-time sewer home for new lives in mainstream New York society.
“I spent so long studying to be a ninja,” said the group’s leader Leonardo, who recently opened an upscale art gallery-cum-bakery in the Meatpacking District.”What if I’d put that energy into going to art school, so I could have become a great painter instead of merely being named after one?”
Leonardo, who came out five years ago, readily confesses to “dabbling a little in watercolours — with a predominantly green palate, naturally”, and plans to hold his first-ever solo exhibition next spring.
Ever the loner, Raphael has been spending most of his time in India, and can now play the sitar nearly as skilfully as he manipulates his trademark sai.
“Splinter was always going on about meditating, but he’d never even heard of the Maharishi,” scoffed Raphael, who now prefers to be called Rajendra. “And to think I once called him Master.”
Perhaps the best-adjusted in the group is amiable nerd Donatello, who has settled down with longtime colleague April O’Neill to raise a brood of half-turtle redheads in a sprawling Brooklyn brownstone. Whereas Donatello once relied exclusively on the sewers for transportation, he now happily drives a Prius.
Self-described “party dude” Michelangelo is the only Turtle not to have attempted to reinvent his life, and is still charming co-eds at A-list events with tales of being a massive star in the mid-90s.
“I ask the ladies back to my pad to watch one of my live-action movies, or to play one of my dozens of me-themed videogames,” Michelangelo said.”And before long, it’s Cowabunga time.”
“And by ‘Cowabunga’, I mean sex,” he said, acknowledging that many now seem to have forgotten the team’s iconic catchphrase.
But while Michelangelo maintains that he loves his bachelor lifestyle, the others say they find it tiresome. “Mikey’s always texting at 2am from some exclusive club, saying he’s just snorted a line off the chest of an Olsen twin,” Leonardo sighed.”He’s going to turn around at forty and feel like he’s wasted his life. God, even the Olsen twins aren’t that young anymore.”
The Turtles’ decision to “put that whole crime-fighting thing on hold to explore our own individual projects,” as Rajendra puts it, has been welcomed by longtime nemesis The Shredder. His Foot Clan has unleashed an unprecedented crime wave in recent months and is said to be well advanced in its latest plan for world domination.
“We’ll get around to doing something about old Shredhead eventually,” Donatello said. “But we have new priorities, and right now mine’s assembling my eldest daughter’s new IKEA bunk bed with built-in homework nook.”",NaN,"July 3, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/turtle-1-1024x578.jpg,Fake
David Leyonhjelm only got into the Senate by promising not to have sex with anyone ,"David Leyonhjelm only got into the Senate by promising not to have sex with anyone, it was revealed today. 




An insider on the Leyonhjelm campaign made the shock revelations on “Sky News”, a children’s play-gym for grown men, which pretends to be a television news network so that angry, white men have something to do during during the day.
“It was a novel tactic,” the insider told The Chaser. “Our polling showed that voters were incredibly repulsed by how creepy David Leyonhjelm is. We worked out that if we guaranteed voters that, if elected, he wouldn’t have sex with any of them, they’d be more likely to vote for him.”
The insider said it was a promise that turned out to be extremely easy to keep.
In addition to that, the campaign focused on the idea that if he was elected to the Senate, he would spend most of his time there. This was extremely popular with his neighbours, and anyone else who had interacted with him.
The slogan that they ultimately used was “A Vote for Leyonhjelm Means He’ll Be In Canberra Most of the Time, and So You Won’t Have To Put Up With Him Lurking Around Here All The Time.”
The insider said it was incredibly effective. “In the history of campaign slogans, it was up there with It’s Time, and Yes We Can.”",NaN,"July 3, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david.jpg,Fake

Peel’s decision to quit buying cigarettes was reinforced when Peel’s father was diagnosed with emphysema. “I realized that my cigarettes were going to kill me, the way that his will kill him. He said to me recently that he wished he’d never started smoking his own cigarettes, and I’ve taken that to heart.”
“It’s a real test of will power not to fork out ten bucks every time I get cravings,” he said. “I called Quitline, and they told me I should avoid situations where I might be tempted, so no convenience stores or petrol stations for me. I’ve really got to do it the hard way, and I’m not above scamming a menthol cigarette from somone else.”
But Peel’s mission will be impossible without the support of those around him. “I’ll be relying on my friends, acquaintances, and patrons of my local pub,” he said. “They say that it’s important to let others know that you’re planning to quit, so I’ll be sure to tell people ‘I’m quitting’ before asking them for a cigarette.”
Peel says he may consider using nicotine gum to help him, if he can find someone to scab it from.",NaN,"June 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/shutterstock_1098307643.jpg,Fake
"Optus to buy ABC, and stream it on its app: “What can go wrong?” ","Optus has announced plans to buy the ABC, and broadcast its programming on its robust app. Announcing the plan, the CEO of Optus said, “What could possibly go wrong?” 




The move comes after the Liberal Party announced plans to sell off the national broadcaster “because Emma Alberici said mean things about Chris Kenny.”
Malcolm Turnbull described the sale as regrettable but necessary. “I support  the public ownership of the ABC, but if 70 years of public broadcasting has to be flushed down the toilet to allow me to keep the numbers in the partyroom for another few months, then I think that’s a sacrifice well worth making.”
Mr Turnbull said that things worked much better in private hands. “Private enterprise is much better at delivering reliable services. I mean, except for Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank, Medibank and the power companies. Oh, and the less said about the airports the better. But besides those isolated examples, the privatisation of public assets has been seamless.”
The carrier said that if they did run into “isolated” technical issues, like they had with the World Cup, then they could always let SBS stream the ABC on its free-to-air channels. “That would be the perfect solution actually. I don’t know why anyone has thought of transmitting this stuff over the air before. It would work better than this streaming shit online.”",NaN,"June 22, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/abc-gvku1c6n7h840rqg7o2_ct677x380.jpg,Fake
Socceroos fans begin search for team they’ll support when Australia is eliminated ,"Australian soccer fans, who have nearly ended their 4 year long wait to be severely disappointed in the upcoming Soccer World Cup, have already begun to prepare for the event, taking to social media today to decide which new team they will support when the Socceroos are eventually eliminated from the group stage. 




Fans report they are eager to catch their Aussie soccer stars on TV, after stumbling home from the pub at 1 in the morning, for the couple of weeks that the group stage occurs. While Australian soccer fans often get labelled as “band-wagoners” around the time of the world cup, many fans often leave the bandwagon, to support a better, more European or South American, soccer team for the games that actually mean something.
Local Socceroos fan, David Gourgonsoloas has described his process for picking his “adopted team” for the qualifying stages of the World Cup, saying, “Well usually I just pick Italy because that’s the old country where my Nonna and Poppa were born, however, with them being out of it, it’s a bit harder this year.”
“I desperately hate Ronaldo so I can’t pick Portugal, and if I was ever seen supporting France I’d lose the respect of my family, so this year I’m just going to pick the new “cool” team. Lets go Nigeria!”
However not all fans share Mr Gourgonsoloas’s view, with head of the Australian Soccer Football Supporters Group, Timothy Kleine stating that, “If we don’t get around our Aussies now, and back them all the way, how are they ever going to achieve their, and our, lofty goal of winning at least one of the halves, of one of the games, friendly or group stage, in this world cup? Goooooooooo Tim Cahill!”
Mr Kleine was then forced to make an unexpected emergency exit after being asked to name any other player than Tim Cahill.",NaN,"June 14, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sh0jboes20y7174mjedf86gb0-1024x576.jpg,Fake
North Korean/US Tensions Reignite as Both Leaders Claim Handshake Win ,"Tensions between the United States and North Korea have reemerged today, as both Kim Jung-Un and Donald Trump claim they were the “clear winner” in their history making handshake at the Singapore summit. 




While Mr Trump claims the North Korean leader gave him a “wet fish” handshake, the notorious dictator hit back claiming that Mr Trump’s hands were “slipperier than an eel”, and “his hand were so sweaty that his fake tan rubbed off onto my hand, it looked like I’d been eating Cheetos all day. And I’d only had three packets!”
The disagreement over the winner of the very minuscule and, probably unimportant in the scheme of things, handshake, has completely revoked any progress made at the summit, with both leaders clearly not being mature enough to move past the incident.
The North Korean state media have ramped up rhetoric following the summit, claiming “Kim Jung-Un, our glorious and supreme leader, with hands of steal and the strength of an Ox, has dominated Mr Trump in the pivotal pre-meeting handshake, with  Mr Trump crying out for his mummy like a little girl, and our leader showing great mercy on him by releasing his hand with grace and poise.”
“If he had wanted to, our leader could have slammed Donald to the ground with more explosiveness than the nuclear bombs that we may or may not have.”
Mr Trump has personally responded to the claims by the North Korean state media, responding through the American state media outlet, Fox News, stating “Mr Un, I think that’s how you say it, Mr Un, pathetic name really, Mr Un, and you know I know people with some really bad names, but his is the worst, and he had a weak handshake that I clearly dominated, I grabbed his hands with force and will, and it was wetter than those pussy’s I also grabbed, with force and will.”
US military officials have confirmed that nuclear warheads have been set ready to deploy, as China, the UK and Russia attempt to negotiate between the two parties and prevent nuclear war, over a handshake.

Driver Of Swastika Tank Revealed ,"New photos leaked to the ABC this afternoon have for the first time revealed the identity of the driver of the tank condemned for flying a Swastika flag in Afghanistan in 2007. Using new photo-enhancing technology, investigators were able to identify the driver, revealing him to be none other than known Nazi sympathiser Prince Harry. 




Officials from joint military forces in Afghanistan have confirmed that Prince Harry secretly packed the swastika flag, along with his famous Nazi uniform, and a favourite photograph of famed Nazi, King Edward VIII, to bring on his tour to Afghanistan in 2007.
“We tried to stop him,” says a general who asked not to be named, “But he pointed out they were all just sentimental family heirlooms, which are technically allowed under the rules. Also his gran could have me beheaded for looking at her the wrong way, so I wasn’t about to argue with the guy.”
However, members of Harry’s troupe have sought to defuse the situation, explaining that the flag was simply a “sick joke” and was not in any way reflective of Harry’s personal views. “Those special forces guys, when their not doing meth and threatening the rest of us, their actually pretty hilarious,” explained one of Harry’s colleagues. “Like that time they blindfolded those prisoners and told them not to move or they’d fall off a cliff. Sounds pretty morbid when I say it out loud, but I guess you had to be there.”
The revelation that the driver was not an Australian national has failed to defuse tensions in Canberra, with politicians pledging to come down hard on the military for allowing contraband items like camera-phones to be snuck onto the battlefield.
“It’s an absolute outrage”, commented Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull this morning, “When I found out that the people we’d hired for a job that revolves around shooting other people weren’t all morally sound, I was shocked! From now on we’re going to be much more picky about the people we recruit through banner ads on 9gag.”",NaN,"June 14, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/driver-1024x546.jpg,Fake
"US, North Korea reach historic agreement to one day make historic agreement ","President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart have made history in Singapore today, after the pair shook hands at the start of their summit, achieving the primary goal of the meeting – to get their photo taken in front of lots of flags, and to make no actual binding agreements whatsoever. 




Preliminary talks between the two nuclear powers earlier in the month revealed that while there were many issues that divided the two camps, there was one uniting issue on which both sides agreed.
“We both want a Nobel Prize, but we also both really detested the idea of doing anything remotely peaceful,” Kim Jong-Un reportedly explained to his top aides. “Fortunately Trump also had zero interest in doing any actual peacemaking and just wanted photos as well. Frankly, I’ve never met any leader who was so easy to deal with.”
While Trump is desperate to win a Nobel Peace Prize because Barack Obama won one, Kim’s interest is simpler. “The Nobel Committee gives winners more than a million dollars. That could feed thousands of starving North Koreans!” he explained. “In theory of course. I’m going to spend it on Lamborghinis.”
For their next meeting, Trump has invited Kim to the White House, and was gratified by how quickly the reclusive North Korean leader accepted. “Of course I’ll come to Washington,” Kim said. “I’ll gladly travel anywhere outside North Korea. That place is a dump.”
Trump has described the meeting as a stunning success, stating he can’t wait to meet Kim again for future photo-ops. “I’ve always said that the person America needed handing its foreign policy was the guy who wrote The Art Of The Deal,” he said. “Unfortunately Tony Schwartz hates me now, but I reckon I did a pretty good job without him.”",NaN,"June 13, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trump_kim-1024x550.jpg,Fake
Five Amazing Facts About the Queen’s Birthday Holiday ,"But celebrations for her birthday are held in June because the weather is better and the mass inequality and homelessness caused by the class system she resides over, is less noticeable. 




Her status was akin to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie of York today—but that all changed when she brutally murdered her grandfather, King George V, in 1936.
She selects a minor royal she dislikes to get into it and then tells the driver them to drive them at high speed through a Parisian tunnel.

"Despite Setbacks, Corporate World Pledges to Keep Shitting on Everyday Australians ","The Business Council of Australia has today issued a public apology following the arrest of Aveo executive Andrew Macintosh, more commonly known as the “Poo Jogger”. Stating that Andrew’s actions were “completely against the ethos of business-people across Australia”, the Council released a statement insisting that this was an isolated event and that it was “not in any way in the spirit of most business people, to be held legally accountable for their shitty actions.” 




A spokesperson for the Corporate, Rich and Privileged Association or CRAPA, today told the media that no amount of arrests or fines will stop the rich and powerful of the country from continuing to use their wealth and power, but especially their bowels, to continue to undermine regular Australian people.
“Mr Macintosh in my eyes did no wrong,” explained Susan Cartwright, lead advocate for the CRAP association. “If anything those people should be thanking him for fertilising their lawn with the charitable donation of his expensive digested company lunches.” Mrs Cartwright then excused herself to go to the bathroom, before proceeding to take a dump on the lecturn.

Sushi train runs late and out of timetable order ,"SYDNEY, Monday: Sydney transport was thrown into disarray last night when unscheduled track work on a sushi train resulted in long delays for diners. The incident follows an horrific derailment at Redfern earlier in the week, which saw three victims sustain third degree wasabi burns to 70% of their bodies. 




Last night’s incident, which occurred during peak hour, caused havoc across the city. While extra sushi trams and buses were scheduled to deal with the overflow, disgruntled diners said the alternative services “were neither efficient nor fashionable”.
The unexpected sushi delays compelled hundreds across the inner city to opt for inferior culinary options. Many were forced to eat fast food as a last resort, causing severe indigestion in some areas, as well as blockages in major arteries across the city.
Angry commuters have now threatened legal action against the owners of the sushi train company. Law firm Maurice Blackburn is already understood to be working on what lawyers and chefs have described as “the world’s first sushi torte”.
NSW Transport’s sushi debacle is causing severe problems for the Berejiklian government. In the Coalition’s seven years in office, the rate of sushi mishaps has increased almost tenfold. NSW now has the worst youth sushi-side rate in the country.
Many NSW voters are starting to hanker for the raw style of former Premier Bob Carr. “He may have been dictatorial,” said one angry diner. “But at least he made the sushi trains run on time.”",NaN,"June 8, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2001/09/maxresdefault-1024x576.jpg,Fake
Poo jogger hoping incident will quickly blow over ,"The poo jogger has told friends he’s hoping everyone will quickly forget the whole thing ever happened and move on with their lives. 




“I hope I’m not known for this one thing for the rest of my life,” the poo jogger said.
Friends and family of the poo jogger were keen to reassure the poo jogger that they were sure the whole poo jogging thing would blow over. “Things blow over,” one friend reassured the poo jogger. “I mean, who still remembers that time Prince Harry dressed up as a Nazi? Or when Malcolm Fraser turned up without his trousers in Memphis? Hardly anyone.”
“In 100 years from now — who knows, maybe poo jogging will become a thing,” his wife reportedly reassured him. “Maybe it will be accepted practice to shit in front of apartments while going out for a jog? Maybe you’re the true thought leader here?”
Experts say “poo jogger” will almost certainly end up being The Macquarie Dictionary’s word of the year, however they said it is entirely possible the incident will be eventually be forgotten. “Occasionally the origin of words is lost to history. In 5000 years, who knows, maybe the term “poo jogger” will fall victim to etymological amnesia and nobody will remember the original poo jogger. After all, there are plenty of Ancient Egyptian words that we don’t know the origin of.”",NaN,"June 8, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/63D906DA-FF26-48C3-8427-61739B8AEE43.jpeg,Fake
NBN chief says gamers to blame for the dodgy butter chicken he had last night ,"The head of the NBN has slammed people who play video games for a severe bout of indigestion he suffered last night after eating dodgy Butter Chicken from an Indian takeaway joint around the corner from his house. 




Mr Morrow dismissed concerns that he should have realised the butter chicken was dodgy, especially as it was advertised as “Last Week’s Butter Chicken” and had green mould growing on it. He claimed he was correct in purchasing the dish. “After all, it was $2 off.”
Mr Morrow said gamers were the real problem. He said that blaming his indigestion on the meal would be like blaming the quality of an internet network on the people who built the internet network. “That doesn’t make any sense.”
The attack comes days after Bill Morrow attacked gamers for using the internet, claiming they were slowing down the network. He pleaded with users to stop using the NBN, pointing out it would be much faster if nobody used it.

Barnaby Joyce blames entire career on Ambien ,"Barnaby Joyce has back-tracked on everything he said during the interview for Channel 7, which will air this Sunday. 




“Look, I’m terribly sorry about that Sunday Night interview, I was Ambien interviewing,” he said, speaking privately to the entire national media. Ambien is a powerful sleeping pill that is popular amongst celebrities wanting to avoid responsibility for stuff they’ve done.
“In fact, come to think of it, I’ve been Ambien governing for the past few years. That explains a huge amount, actually.”
Joyce backtracked on the interview after it became apparent Channel 7 had managed to capture the true nature of his character in the interview.
Joyce has worked tirelessly over the years to keep his true character private. “Some private matters are private. Not my affair, obviously, nor the intimate details of my sex life, nor even the privacy of my baby son. They’re all up for sale. But my narcissism is a private between me and the people close to me in my life that I’m hurting with it.”

Barnaby Joyce wondering whether interview will affect future chances of picking up ,"Barnaby Joyce has expressed privately to the nation’s media that he’s beginning to suspect the events of the past few months may adversely affect his ability to pick up staffers in the future. 




“Look, on the bright side, Vicki has walked away with $150k so it’s not like she’s been totally dudded by going out with me,” he said.
“But the fact that I come across as a narcissistic dick who blames everything on other people will probably send the wrong message to all the single ladies out there walking the corridors of Parliament House. Personally I blame Vicki for that.”
Joyce said everyone now knows that he’s got a baby and most women steer clear of having affairs with men in that situation. “I’m going to hold that against Sebastian for the rest of his life,” he told the entire nation even though they didn’t want to know.
Joyce told The Chaser “you can’t choose who you love, and in my case, it’s whatever piece of skirt is hottest in the parliamentary bar.”

Scientists discover cure to lactose intolerance is just wanting to eat the food ,"The CSIRO have today announced new findings into research on lactose intolerance, suggesting that they have found the uncomfortable symptoms of the condition are only felt when eating dairy food that you do not enjoy. The report suggests that there is a specific chemical in the brain that completely blocks the effects that lactose has on a sufferers body, that is only triggered when the consumer is enjoying the food, scientists are labelling the chemical reaction “L.T.Y” or “Lying to Yourself”.

"Public shocked to learn Dominos, creator of choc-ice cream pizza, is not a health food store ","Members of the public have today reacted with shock and outrage following reports by Deakin University that Dominos Pizza is a very unhealthy food – a piece of information that people had no way of knowing this before this report. 




Stating that they had always thought of the fast-food takeaway pizza as a food that should be consumed every single day, members of the public have demanded their money back in droves, claiming they were mislead. “All this time Dominos has been marketing its stuffed-crust, fat dripping, three cheese salt-pumped bread plate as a sensible and balanced part of your daily diet, and now they’re telling us that it’s something that should only be consumed on special occasions!? It’s an outrage! Next they’ll probably be telling us that we shouldn’t be eating the whole pizza as a single person’s meal, and also finishing off a two-litre bottle of Pepsi and a stick of garlic bread dripping with butter in the same sitting.”
Informed that drinking a two litre bottle of Pepsi in one sitting was in fact a terrible health decision, onlookers expressed dismay. “Why the hell do they call it a Diet Pepsi then!” screamed one woman on the street. “I’ve been drinking nothing but Diet Pepsi for months now! It’s a good thing I balanced it out by eating that vegetable last month.”
Members of the public say they have learned their lesson, and from now on will be only sticking to healthy, body friendly food. “Yep from now on it’s only apples for me,” reported one Dominos convert this evening. “A MacDonald’s apple pie, to balance out a hearty meal of their 36 chicken nuggets. I can already feel my heart thanking me!”

"Public crowdfund $160,000 to pay Barnaby Joyce not to talk about his sex life ","A crowdfunding campaign organised this week in order to pay Barnaby Joyce $160,000 to not talk about his sex life on national TV has been declared a stunning success, with the Pozible campaign reaching its fundraising goal within just an hour of launching. Although only originally intended to raise $160,000 – the amount required to outbid Seven for their interview fee, organisers now report they have almost tripled that amount, with the public clamouring to do anything they can to keep the former deputy Prime Minister from spilling the beans about his sordid sex life. 




“It’s quite extraordinary,” says campaign organiser Monique Waters. “I thought it would take us at least a month to raise that kind of money, but at this rate we’re going to have enough to buy Barnaby’s silence for the rest of his life by the end of the week, with enough left over to begin research into ways to wipe the public’s memory entirely so they can forget this affair ever happened. It really brings a tear to my eye, thinking about that horrid sweaty sack of tomatoes bonking away like that.”
Asked why he was so quick to throw money at the campaign, major donor Andy Johnson says he felt it was his civic duty to donate to the cause. “I’ve been saving up for years to afford an extension out the back of the house,” says Johnson, “but when I heard about this campaign, I knew it just wasn’t something I could turn a blind eye to. Sure giving $10,000 out of my savings might have put a dent in my dreams, but it’s a small price to pay to put a stop to so much suffering and illness that tales of Barnaby’s filthy office-table sex romps would have caused.”
However, experts have warned that fundraising the money may have the opposite effect intended, with many more politicians now considering coming out about their sex lives in order to secure lucrative non-disclosure payouts from the public. “It’s been an absolute nightmare, the dam has well and truly opened,” reports political journalist Annabel Crabb. “Just this morning alone I’ve had Kevin Andrews on the phone offering to give all the saucy details about that one time he had sex with his wife for non-reproductive purposes after overdoing the sacramental wine, Jackie Lambie hasn’t stopped calling to spill all about how ‘well hung’ her last three tinder dates were, and Cory Bernardi has just now forwarded on an email about his last man-on-man dalliance in the parliamentary bathroom.

Sydney friends’ facebook feed to become completely insufferable for next 2 weeks ,"Members of the public logging into Facebook this evening have been left outraged and dismayed at discovering the service has become completely unusable, after the entire population of Sydney logged in at once to upload the same image of the Opera House lit up with orange lights. Witnesses to the incident say that the images were “deeply distressing”, comparing the deluge to similar tragedies that have taken place around late May “every single god damned year since 2012.” 




“It starts with a slightly out of focus photo of the Opera House, shortly followed after by ten more of the exact same shot. After that comes the blurry picture of the MCA, a few of the boats, and then if we’re really unlucky they’ll also put up something romantic like them and their partner holding hands in the dark surrounded by a bunch of glowing fish. It makes me wish there was another Telstra outage, just so people would be forced to put down their phones for two mintues.”
“It’s almost as stale and repetitive as sculpture by the sea,” reported another witness. “Though at least with those there’s some art to enjoy. What the hell does Vivid have to offer in a photo? It’s just a bunch of blue buildings. There’s literally no enjoyment to be gained by seeing that second hand through an underexposed three inch jpeg on a computer screen.”
However visitors to Vivid this year remain unperturbed by the pleas of the public, insisting the photos they are taking are for their own enjoyment, and not for social media. “I just know I will look back at these 80 photos of Customs House again,” reported one perpetrator attending the event. “Just like the 200 photos of the News Years’ fireworks I took earlier this year. I mean, I certainly didn’t spend the entire spectacle watching a multi million dollar display of fireworks through a three inch phonescreen because I’m cripplingly addicted to the dopamine that meaningless likes on social media provide!

Responsible Drink Driver Indicates Before Running Up Curb ,"Police have today reported that a man who was three times the legal limit to drive, has respectfully indicated to the cars behind, to the side, and any pedestrians that may be in front, that he is ready to run up on the curb of the street he was wildly driving on. 




Police have confirmed that while the driver narrowly missed running into a preschool and its adjacent playground, if it wasn’t for his quick mirror check and over the shoulder blind spot check, then he may have also of taken out the cyclists who were just close behind him.
The driver, Andrew Pennington, was shocked by his actions, saying that it was completely not in his character what transpired that morning suggesting, “I cant believe i didn’t try and hit those cyclists, if i wasn’t drunk then i definitely would have taken them out without the slightest bit of concern, clearly my drink driving is affecting my ability to make clear, calm and rationale decisions on the road, and i must change to save myself from further embarrassment.”
After being informed of his close call with the pre-school, Mr Pennington suggested that “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, at least that’s what i tell myself before necking a bottle of rum and getting behind the wheel, and goddammit do i feel strong.”
Mr Pennington was released from police custody at 10 am the next day, with a date with court coming within the next month, with Mr Pennington suggesting that it was “beer o’clock”. While some thought it would be slightly irresponsible to start drinking just after a major drink driving accident, that nearly cost the lives of numerous people, Pennington retorted “hey im doing the responsible thing of only drinking light beers, maybe a couple full strengths after, rum and coke or 10, couple shots, and no i will not be driving after, ill be taking the sound decision to abuse a middle eastern taxi driver to get home tonight.”",NaN,"May 25, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/car.jpg,Fake
Foley defends ‘white flight’ comments: “I was incredibly drunk when I said it” ,"NSW Opposition Leader Luke Foley has defended his comments that white people are fleeing the Western Suburbs of Sydney because of the number of immigrants arriving, saying that he was drunk when he made the comments to the Daily Telegraph. 




“In my defence, when you’re drunk as often as I am, it’s very hard to keep track of whether what you’re saying is racist or not,” he told The Chaser, while he enjoyed his first beer of the morning.
“To be honest, I usually try and hide racism by dressing it up with a bullshit class analysis. But I was so drunk I completely forgot to do that.”
Foley himself lives in a highly multicultural electorate, but he hasn’t been seen there much recently, leading to suspicions that he himself has participated in white flight from the seat. But Foley dampened those suspicions. “No. Not at all. I love my electorate. It’s just that the member’s bar at Parliament House is subsidised, so it’s much cheaper to drink there.”

Local kid killing it at open mic night with smutty rendition of Cottees jingle ,"Local primary schooler Cooper Bailey has this week taken out the grand prize at the National Open Mic comedy competition after impressing judges with his innovative smutty take on a popular TV jingle. Stating that he was inspired by his idols in year 6, who had previously come up with such genius takes on popular ads as “Good on ya bum”, a play on the Tip Top slogan, Cooper says that he hopes his success will help inspire other ten year olds to find new ways to fill TV jingles with PG rated swear words. 




“At first I was just going to go out there and make farting noises with my hands, that’s never failed to get a laugh with my classmates in the playground,” said Cooper, “But then I thought, no if I’m going to do this I’d better bring a bit of showbiz to the stage, and a song and swear words combo just developed naturally from that.”
Asked whether he has plans to spin this success into a potential career, Cooper says he’s already got to work on a second set which he plans to bring to next year’s competition. “I’ve been looking at the aeroplane jelly song and I think that has a lot of potential.” he says, “I don’t want to give away too much just yet, but lets just say the words ‘me’ and ‘pee’ can both fit the same metre.”",NaN,"May 21, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kid_standup.jpg,Fake
Telstra Outage Leaves Customers Unable to Scroll News Feed on Morning Bus ,"Millions of Australian Telstra customers have been left unable to mindlessly scroll their Facebook news feeds this morning, after the company suffered yet another mobile coverage outage, affecting customers’ ability to access data, make phonecalls, and avoid conversation in the work elevator. The outage has caused much distress within Telstra’s customer base, with widespread, harrowing reports of customers having to actually make eye contact with other strangers, and at times even have to make polite small talk with people they don’t even know on the bus. 




One Telstra customer, Alex Hart, was furious with his mobile provider telling reporters, “I had to read a fucking book on the bus this morning, do you know how long its been since I have read something like that, probably the last one was the magic school bus, fuck me was I bored. If that’s not bad enough, I use Spotify to listen to music, all I could listen too was the trashy gossip of the two school kids behind me, and I can tell you now, I still don’t give a shit about how many guys Kerry from year 10 has kissed.”
Workplaces across the country have also been plunged into chaos by the outage with workers unsure what to do with themselves, and productivity skyrocketing. “Without being able to check Facebook on my phone every two minutes I finished my entire day’s work before midday,” said one annoyed office worker Jan Jannetson. “I’m having to just pad time now by finishing up all my overdue projects. It’s just awful.”
However, not everyone was negatively affected by the outage, with homeless people reporting a massive increase in donations as pedestrians were unable to avert their gaze from the many beggars in the city’s streets. Many of Australia’s public transport ranters also reported a major uptick in the attention paid to their wacky and often times unintelligible rants, with local pan-handler and part time reincarnation of John the Baptist Richard Shermer describing the morning as “the most attention anyone has ever paid to my thoughts on our lizard overlords.”",NaN,"May 21, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/th.jpg,Fake
Earth Hour Successfully Offsets First 8 Seconds of Vivid Festival ,"Sydney’s annual “Vivid” festival is set to begin this Friday, with organisers stating that they are excited to once again completely undermine all the energy saving made by last month’s “Earth Hour” within the first 10 seconds of the festival. With plenty of new and innovative lighting displays set to be revealed at the 2 week festival, there is sure to be plenty of attractions to help visitors forget the $8 million of taxpayer money being spent on just two weeks of pink lightbulbs. 




Responding to criticism over the festival’s energy wastage, chief organiser Richard Orville has explained that the annual event has been actively trying to pursue energy saving methods in recent years. “We’ve stopped putting the lights on during the day,” says Richard, “mainly because you can’t see them then, but I guess it also has the added benefit of saving energy.”
However critics have hit back, stating it is not just the huge amount of lights used that is the problem, but also the extra events scheduled. Anti-Vivid advocate, Mitch Howard, told the Chaser “It’s not only Vivid’s lights displays that make Gina Rinehart look like a modern day Al Gore, some of these planned events are just absurd! What has an ‘intimate outdoor acoustic set under the stars’ got to do with lights displays? And why do they need to heat it with twenty-five space heaters!? Just hold it indoors for gods sake. Don’t these people realise tt’s the middle of winter!”
“And don’t get me started with their opening event, ‘Malcom Roberts sets fire to a 10ft pile of coal and laughs hysterically for an hour’ they’re not even trying to hid it at this point.”",NaN,"May 21, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/vivid-1024x596.jpg,Fake
"Royal couple experience first night of dull, routine sex ","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have had sex for the first time as a married couple, in a session the newlyweds described as “adequate”. 




In order to honour their recent commitment to each other to never again have sex with anyone else, no matter how much they want to, the couple decided to do it in the missionary position with the lights turned off.
After the brief session, Harry caught up on the results of the football on his phone, while Meghan browsed Instagram.
Eventually, Harry felt drowsy and said “Night” to Meghan before turning his back and falling asleep. Meghan then read the next chapter in a Lee Child novel she’s been reading and then also fell asleep.

WEDDING CANCELLED: Harry and Meghan split over whether it’s Yanny or Laurel ,"In a move that has stunned the royal family, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have announced they are calling off their wedding, citing “irreconcilable differences” over whether it’s pronounced Yanny or Laurel. 




Insiders say that the argument started harmlessly enough, with Harry casually mentioning over breakfast on Friday morning “that silly meme that’s clearly Yanny”. Meghan initially reacted well, biting her tongue at Harry’s misguided belief.
By midday, however, palace guards had to be called to their residence to break-up what one witness said was “the most vicious knife fight I’ve ever seen”.
Prince Harry achieved house colours in Knife Fighting at Eton, while friends close to Meghan say she is also an accomplished street brawler, a skill she developed while living in Hollywood, to deal with Harvey Weinstein at cocktail parties.
By mid-afternoon, the Queen was called in, in a last ditch effort to broker a peace between the couple. However, after hearing the meme, the Queen got into an argument with Prince Philip about whether it was Yanny or Laurel, ending only after the Queen got Philip in a head-lock and made him beg for his life and admitting he was wrong.
Instead of the wedding, a pile £32 million of taxpayers money will be simply be burnt outside Windsor Castle, achieving much the same result.",NaN,"May 18, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/markle-1024x576.jpg,Fake
Mueller asks Trump aides to pause corrupt deals to give him a chance to catch up ,"The FBI Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has pleaded with Trump aides to pause all corrupt and criminal dealings to allow him time to work through the backlog of crimes that they’ve already committed. 




“What I’m asking is for anyone close to Trump to stop breaking the law just for a week or two, so I can get onto of all the crimes that have already been committed,” Mr Mueller said.
Mr Mueller said that if he didn’t get a repreive, he doubted he would ever be able to release his report into Donald Trump’s relationship with Russia. “I mean, I feel like I’m getting further away from the conclusion every time I open my Twitter feed.”
Mr Mueller said it was having a genuine impact on his enthusiasm for bringing down the President. “I took this case on because it was a simple open and shut case of treason. But there are just so many other, extra crimes, it’s becoming a real bore. I get to work each morning, and no matter how many charges I file, there are always more to file by the end of the day.”
The plea comes just hours after it was revealed President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, had asked the head of a $100 billion Qatari investment fund for money to pass on to members of the Trump family.
But insiders say it’s unlikely Trump and his aides will take notice of Mueller’s plea. “It’s actually a brilliant legal strategy, to outrun a prosecutor by swamping him in more and more crimes,” Trump’s current legal counsel Rudy Giuliani told Sean Hannity. “Oh. Wait, did I say, that? I didn’t say that. I meant it’s a brilliant legal strategy to be innocent of all crimes. That’s what I meant.”",NaN,"May 16, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mueller-1024x720.jpg,Fake
Tupperware somehow even wetter after 8 hours in drying up rack ,"Local mother of two Edith Sexism has today stunned scientists and revolutionised water conservation efforts after discovering that common Tupperware is capable of conjuring water out of thin air if left in a drying up rack for more than an hour. 




“At first I thought it must have been the water left over from washing it up,” said Edith to a packed symposium of scientists this afternoon, “but then I realised, this container was only given a light rinse, and now it’s absolutely soaked! What’s more when I tipped it over there were at least three more litres of water hidden in those curled up corners, in fact there was enough to completely soak all the plates and cutlery that had also been sitting in the rack that were completely dry only moments ago. The only logical conclusion is that this tupperware must be generating water somehow.”
Scientists hope to start using this new water harnessing technology to bring new hope to drought affected regions in rural Australia. “We’ve been testing out a new 50km rack filled with over 10,000 Tupperware containers over the Murray Darling basin, and while I don’t want to jinx things, I must say the results so far are astounding.”
“We’re seeing almost three times more water produced than our old method of having a bunch of kids stand around biting into McCain’s super juicy corn, as well as ten times less suicides from farmers who realise that the rains actually aren’t ‘ere.”
“We’re also toying with a new model which involves simply placing a single Tupperware container in a dishwasher and putting it on for a rinse cycle. Our latest research has confirmed we can gather thousands of litres this way.”",NaN,"May 10, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/washing_up-1024x564.jpg,Fake
"Told to increase Australian content, Netflix launches dark, gritty reboot of Huey’s Cooking Adventures ","Netflix Australia has today unveiled a raft of new Australian based series, following warnings from the Australian government that the streaming company may be forced to comply with laws requiring TV stations to air at least 50% Australian made content. Stating that they intend to take this requirement as seriously as every Australian free to air broadcaster does, Netflix announced that 50% of all content on Netflix Australia will now be news and infomercials, interspersed with the occasional low-cost reality show about celebrity chefs getting married to farmers. 




Netflix has also announced their intention to relaunch a number of classic Australian TV series in order to meet the Australian content quota, including a dark, gritty reboot of Huey’s Cooking Adventures, a new series of The Mole in which a contestant is stationed in the White House and must work out which single staff member isn’t a Russian Mole, and a new Netflix Original series featuring Waleed Aly reading the phonebook, to applause and whoops of approval from an enraptured studio audience.
In keeping with the other compulsory Australian content requirement, Netflix have simultaneously announced that they will now be running a 24 hour live stream of Osher Günsberg, as he goes about his day to day life, shopping, eating and occasionally sleeping between breaks in the filming of the twenty Bachelor series Channel Ten now produce per year.",NaN,"May 10, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/huey-1024x577.jpg,Fake
"Trump: “I consulted world leaders on Iran, but Rick from Texas had a point” ","American President Donald Trump has today hit back at critics accusing him of acting rashly by cancelling the Iranian nuclear deal, stating that he consulted many world leaders on his decision, but ultimately it was retired post office worker and singing trout enthusiast, Garth Somerton from Texas, who convinced the president to pull out of the deal. 




“While some of those so called ‘braniacs’ in the press might think having a cohesive strategy to denuclearise the Middle East would be a sensible policy,” said Trump, “after a long discussion with Garth, I am convinced that my supporter base of white uneducated Americans whose entire foreign knowledge consists of the menu at the Outback Steakhouse, have a much better idea about how to solve the multi-generational war taking place in the Middle East.”
As Trump’s key adviser in this decision, Mr Somerton says he was startled at the amount of media attention he received, describing the 10 person media scrum as “The most amount of people I’ve ever seen in one place at one time.”
“I called Trump about my thoughts on the Iran deal last week, and wouldn’t you know it, they put me right through! Said they thought I was just Steve Bannon drunk agin or sommint. Anyway I told Trump that the Iran problem was just like what I do with my daughter Etheline when she eats me candycorn, I take away her pocket money and make her think about what she shouldn’t’ve did that for. Sure she weren’t makin no nuclear weapons, but it’s all connected ernit?”
Asked if he’s had any other ideas on foreign policy, Mr Somerton stated “Mah only policy on foreigners is that I don’t like them. Specially those turban wearing, Arab, Muslims in the Middle East, like those Chinese, Kenyans and North Koreans.”
Despite the fallout from the decision, Mr Trump believes that his supporter base could become a vital source of knowledge that he could tap into more often for policy, suggesting “These world leaders really aren’t that smart and special, trust me. From now on, I’ll be entrusting much more of my choices on policies, such as economics, health and the benefits of inbreeding on the collective wisdom of my supporter base.”

John Howard hospitalised after calling for increased welfare ,"The family of John Howard have today thanked the public for their support during a “difficult time”, following reports that the former Prime Minister had called for an increase in welfare payments in this year’s budget. Stating that the signs that Mr Howard was losing his marbles were “now irrefutable”, members of his family said that they had no choice but to have Mr Howard committed for his own good. 




“I actually think there is an argument for increasing welfare payments in this country,” said Howard to a room of concerned looking doctors this morning. “I think the freeze on Newstart increases has probably gone on too long!” he continued shouting, as they rolled him away in a straight jacket.
“He’s clearly very ill,” said neurosurgeon Dr. Ugme this afternoon. “I haven’t seen a case of cognitive dissonance this bad since Chris Pine campaigned for the government to save the ABC in Adelaide while simultaneously cutting the ABC’s budget.”
Mr Howard is the latest economically liberal voice to come down with a severe case of socialism in recent weeks, with the Business Council of Australia also being placed into quarantine following an official announcement calling for a rise in Newstart. “We believe that the best way forward for helping the unemployed get back on their feet is to provide them with a liveable income,” said the council in a clearly deranged and rambling press statement yesterday.
Doctors have meanwhile given the all clear to Prime Minister Turnbull, a former proud proponent of social welfare, stating that he is not at risk of catching the Newstart disease, despite recently meeting and shaking hands with John Howard. “Much like a belief in climate change, taxing miners, or a republic, once you’ve been ill with socialism, you won’t likely come down with the bug again,” said Mr Turnbull’s doctor. “If anything we’re much more concerned about Mr Turnbull’s spine, which is showing some serious wear and tear. After so many backflips in recent years, it’s been worn down to a husk. In fact it barely even shows up in X-Rays these days, you could say the man is completely spineless!”",NaN,"May 10, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/howard_hospital-1024x560.jpg,Fake
Low income earner dreaming of all the smashed avos he can buy with $10 tax cut ,"Low income earner Josh Summers has today opened a box of wine and broken out the Home Brand Jatz in celebration, after hearing the good news about this year’s federal budget. “All these years of abject poverty have finally paid off!” said Josh happily this afternoon, wiping a tear from his eye, after learning that he would be getting a $10 a week tax cut as a result of being cripplingly poor. 




Asked what he planned to do with the saving generously meted out by the government, Josh says he hopes to use it to pay down some debt, put a deposit on a house, maybe take a holiday for the first time in ten years, and the rest will go into a high interest savings account. “With five dollars a week put in a savings account, indexed at 30% compounding interest, I project I’ll have as much as negative $50 in a year’s time, when adjusting for account fees,” says Josh. “Can you imagine what having that kind of debt would feel like? I sure can I’ve already got that much and more. But at least I’ll be able to put $40 a month towards that $30,000 worth of credit card debt now. Crisis averted.”
However, Josh admits that these dreams may not be realistic as life’s essentials must come first. “My last pair of $10 shoes from Target have got holes in both the toes, so I should probably buy a new pair for my job interview next week,” he says, 
“I’m applying to a trendy inner-city cafe. If I’m lucky they might even pay me a living wage! I’m not holding my breath though, after all cafe owners are doing it tough these days. It’s not like they’re getting a $10 tax cut in this years budget!”
Josh then excused himself to another room followed by muffled screams, after he was informed that rich business owners would be receiving a much, much larger tax cut.",NaN,"May 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/daydreaming-1024x543.jpg,Fake
“I could live off $40 a day” claims minister who spends $60 a day on stationery ,"Liberal party backbencher and enemy of Microsoft spellcheck Michaelia Cash has today claimed she could easily survive on the $40 a day Newstart allowance, by comparing the cost of living on Centrelink payouts to a backpacking holiday she once took in the early 90s. 




Speaking to the ABC’s Insiders programme, the Minister for Jobs explained that because she had chosen to take a relaxing holiday once that all poverty was therefore solved and everyone should just stop complaining.
“When I was young, I didn’t sit around moping about ‘not having enough money to pay for dental work’,” said Mrs Cash. “No I got off my butt, pulled up my socks, and took a three year backpacking holiday around the Middle East safe in the knowledge that I could return home anytime to the care and comfort of my father who was both a politican and a company director. I think the poor of this country could learn a thing or two from my example.”
The minister, who was caught failing to declare $1.4 million worth of assets last year, said she believed she could do very well on Centrelink. “If there’s one thing I know Centrelink likes, it’s people who forget to declare assets.” said the Minister.
Sending out a press release to journalists today on low gloss rippled paper with a pre-printed letterhead, a process costing a mere $3 per sheet before accounting for printer ink, Ms Cash explained that her offensive and wildly out of touch comments had simply been misconstrued, and that she fully intends to apologise as soon as she can find a whiteboard to escort her out to the press room.
Ms Cash was then spotted exiting her $800 a day office, reading one of her $200 Who’s Who magazines, before getting into her her $100 a day Comcar and making a phonecall on her $11 a day mobile phone.
“The idea that Newstart could barely cover rent, let alone essentials like healthy food, clothing, and transport is absolutely ludicrous,” said cash to her expenses paid chauffeur, as he drove her to one of her $300 a day domestic flights. “Why when I was a young person you could rent an entire house for $100 a week and still have ample money left over for food and clothing!”
When questioned by the driver whether increases in rent and inflation may have changed things since Cash’s time as a freewheeling backpacker, Ms Cash said that he was missing the point. “Yes, it might be more expensive these days,” explained Cash, “but that just means people will have to cut back on non-essentials like coffee, health insurance, and food.”
“It’s not the government’s job to be making sure that the public are able to put a roof over their heads AND eat every single night,” scoffed Ms Cash, “What do you think this is, Soviet Russia?”",NaN,"May 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cash_stationary-1024x519.jpg,Fake
Libs roll out the ol’ minority dartboard to decide who’s getting shafted in 2018 budget ,"The LNP partyroom has today once more partaken in what has become a time honoured tradition on budget day, by rolling out the ceremonial Liberal Party Minority Dartboard in order to officially decide which minority group will be getting completely fucked in this year’s budget. 




Dressed in their ceremonial white armbands, members of the party solemnly wheeled out the dusty and pockmarket dartboard, now completely covered in post-its naming various minority groups – added during the short but eventful Abbott ministry. “Originally it was just a few post-its naming the usual groups, you know women, the ABC, public education, nurses and just one dart.” says Liberal Party spokesman and part time vampire James Patterson. “We figured we’d at least give them a fighting chance. But since the Abbott government revolutionised the budget process we’ve added over 100 more underfunded groups to the board – from the climate council to the Australian Ballet, as well as 100 more darts.”
“The dartboard strategy has really helped us look like sensible economic managers since the old plan of selling off every single asset that wasn’t bolted to the ground dried up,” says Liberal Treasurer Scott Morrison. “Just three more cuts to various wildlife protection funds and we’ll be able to give the big banks another tax-break they so clearly need.”
The ceremony was followed shortly after by the traditional wheeling out of the second dartboard used to decide who would be benefiting from the budget of the year. Featuring nothing but a A3 photo of Rupert Murdoch, members once again took turns each throwing a rose at the picture, before unanimously deciding to just leave a truck of unmarked dollar bills outside News Corp headquarters.",NaN,"May 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dartboard.jpg,Fake
Federal government tips budget surplus after taking out $5 billion Nimble loan ,"The Federal government has today given the strongest hint yet that the 2018 budget will present a surplus for the first time in years, after the government embarked on a year long project of cutting funding from “wasteful areas such as the CSIRO, the NBN, education, overseas aid, and chemotherapy, which is believe to have netted as much as $15 million in savings, almost covering the cost of Bronwyn Bishop’s gold card travel for the last month. 




Asked by reporters if the Liberals were still “the government of fiscal responsibility” despite not having resolved the budget deficit five years after promising to do so, Scott Morrison was then seen taking out a quick $5 billion Nimble loan under the table, before announcing to journalists that “the budget crisis has been solved”.
Questioned what the government intended to do with the new surplus, Morrison said that it was the government’s resolve to use the money to pay off the 30% interest that they would be gaining on the Nimble loan every day until they pay it back – right after they buy a new 8′ flatscreen for the partyroom, and give big business another tax break.
“Yea nah yea, I better also get meself some more ciggies as well,” announced Morrison, “and pay off the credit cards, eh? Oh nah actually on second thought I’m gonna buy some new spinning rims for me comcar. That’ll look sick!”",NaN,"May 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nimble.jpg,Fake
Australia believes it could survive with Michaelia Cash being unemployed ,"It has been revealed today in a morning newspoll that most Australian voters would be perfectly able to go about their day to day lives if Liberal backbencher Michaelia Cash were unemployed. While Australia knows that it would have a cut back on certain lifestyle choices,  such as leaking important federal police raids to the media and falsely accusing opposition politicians of sleeping with their staffers, ultimately the Australian public say they would be able to get through the rough period without the Liberal Party backbencher. 




The newspoll was today conducted after Cash stated that she believes she could live off the newstart allowance, because she once spent time backpacking on holiday, an experience that she suggested was like being on the unemployment benefit as she too, “drank a lot of goon and partied a lot, just like other unemployed people.”
“I understand that people who are unemployed often have to chose between feeding themselves or paying for necessities such as internet, but I had to pay 10 cents a minute in a run down internet cafe in France to search up the hottest nightclubs in Europe,” said Cash empathetically, “and after that night on the town, I too was unable to eat the next morning.”
The Liberal Party has come out strongly against the Newspoll findings, stating in a press release, “The Liberal Party stands with Michaelia Cash, and we will not let her lose her job due to the findings of a single newspoll, they don’t even really matter. The Liberal Party is the only truly fiscally conservative party in the nation and thus we are determined to save Cash.”",NaN,"May 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/22f61c3839a0bb4eee4ccb99f4f48212.jpg,Fake
The Latham fix: How John Howard really won an historic fourth term ,"In 2004, John Howard was returned to office to serve an historic fourth term as Prime Minister, convincingly beating Labor rival Mark Latham. However, for the first time, The Chaser reveals the story behind Howard’s stunning election comeback.




(This is an extract from Chapter 12 of The Completely True History of Australia)
 
It’s 9:30 on the evening of Saturday 9 October, 2004. John Howard walks onto the stage at Sydney’s Wentworth Hotel to declare victory in his fourth straight federal election. “I am truly humbled by this extraordinary expression of confidence in the leadership of this great nation,” he says, to roars of approval. 
But it’s all an act. An elaborate hoax. A fix. The truth is, Howard never won that election. Mark Latham won it. Convincingly. 
Only a few people have known what actually took place on October 9. Howard’s Chief of Staff Arthur Sinodinos; Labor powerbroker Graham Richardson; then first-time MP Malcolm Turnbull; some guy from the Australian Electoral Commission and Howard himself all knew. They’ve guarded the secret carefully, until now. 
Sinodinos got pissed after an ICAC hearing last year and boasted about the whole episode to one of his mates. We secretly recorded the conversation. 
“So it’s about 4pm on election day and the numbers are looking really bad for us. The exit polls are saying we’re heading towards a bollocking, which means Latham is hours away from becoming PM. Can you fucking imagine? Mark Latham! Then I get this panicked phone call from Graham Richardson, would you believe. ‘We’ve got a problem,’ he says. ‘Latham is about to fucking win.’
I’m confused because I was pretty sure Graham Richardson was a Labor man. But, you know, my memory’s not all that flash. I took a $74,000 donation from Australian Water Holdings when I was Liberal Party Treasurer and totally forgot about it, and I was the fucking deputy chair of Australian Water Holdings! My memory’s a total bloody sieve. 
Anyway, Richardson confirms that he is, in fact, a Labor man, but that they don’t want Latham to win. Can you believe it? They actually don’t want him to win. He’s a liability, they reckon. He’s crazy. 
‘I know he’s crazy,’ I say. ‘He came up to me out of the blue last week, took my glasses off my face, cleaned them, then broke them in half,’ I say to Richardson. 
‘Oh that, no that was my idea. It’s just a prank we play on Liberal staffers,’ Richardson replies. 
‘Oh, right,’ I say. ‘Well the week before that he came right up in my face, got out a polishing cloth and started polishing my head, and then said he was going to crush my spirit with his bare hands.’ 
‘No, no I don’t think you understand,’ Richardson says. ‘He’s properly nuts. The guy’s not all there. He is unstable. Just to give you an example, he came into my office the other day, pulled down his pants, and then started urinating on the pot plant in the corner – said ‘it needed a water’ – and then …’ 
‘Oh wow, that is truly bizarre,’ I say. 
‘What? No, that’s not the story. That’s just how we start meetings in the Labor Party. No, the crazy part is, he pulls up his pants, sits down and then says (and I’m quoting word for word here) that there is no longer a place for factions in the Labor Party. No place at all he reckons! And he wants to be running the place! Like I said, total nutcase.’ 
‘Right. Yeah. Totally crazy,’ I say. 
Anyway, so Richardson goes on to say he wants to rig the result. Put together some sort of ‘arrangement’. Says we need to meet straight away to discuss the details. Somewhere discreet. Says he knows just the place.
***
Half an hour later I’m standing in a cramped toilet cubical in the Wentworth Hotel bathroom with Graham Richardson, John Howard and some other guy I’ve never seen before.
‘This is Bruce from the Australian Electoral Commission. We’ve um, let’s just say we’ve done some work together before,’ Richardson says, gesturing to the man. 
‘Yeah I know Bruce,’ Howard says. ‘We’ve also done …’ 
‘Great, so we all know each other then,’ Richardson says. 
There’s an awkward moment when Richardson manoeuvres himself into the space between the toilet bowl and the side cubical wall trying not to tear his pants on the toilet roll holder. Then he says, ‘Let’s get down to business.’ 
He called it a ‘gentleman’s agreement’. ‘We hand Government to you this time, and then, in three year’s time you hand it over to us. By then you’ll have been PM for 10 years or so John, you’ll be ready to move on. It’ll be a very smooth transition.’
And then, at the very moment Richardson says ‘smooth transition’ we hear these footsteps walking past the cubical, and a voice calls out ‘Who’s in there?’
‘Fuck, it’s Peter Costello!’ Howard hisses. ‘Everyone shut up.’ 
‘Who’s that?’ Costello says, really suspicious. 
‘Um it’s just me, Peter,’ Howard says. 
‘I heard talking. Did you say smooth transition? I’m sure I heard someone say smooth transition.’
‘Clear transmission. I can’t get a clear transmission on my wireless in here, that’s all.’
‘Righto,’ Costello says. He’s not convinced though.
There’s a very tense couple of minutes while John pretends to go to the toilet. He tears the toilet paper off the roll, scrunches it up, shifts from side to side on the seat and makes a plopping sound. Then Peter finally leaves. 
‘Very, very fucking close,’ Howard says. ‘Do NOT under any circumstances say ‘smooth transition’ again, Costello might come back. Anyway, so you were saying we just hand over to you guys in three years. Sounds fair. Do you have someone in mind?’
Richardson suggests Kevin Rudd. 
‘Who the fuck is Kevin Rudd?’ John and I say. 
‘You know, that quiet, geeky guy with glasses. Into China. Quite the opposite of Latham. He’s a really level-headed bloke, a steady hand. You’ll like him.’
‘Oh him. Sure, harmless. Let’s do this,’ Howard says. 
We squeeze ourselves out from our positions around the toilet and begin to walk out of the cubicle when a small voice says, ‘Um, small problem.’ 
It’s the AEC guy. We’d forgotten all about him. Poor guy was perched up on top of the toilet cistern, ducking to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling. 
‘It’s now 5:52pm,’ he says. ‘In less than 10 minutes the AEC central computer will start feeding results to the TV stations. Within an hour, Antony Green is going to be containing his hard-on while saying ‘Labor landslide’. Any bright ideas on how we’re going to rig an entire election?’
‘Just hack the computer thing. Change the result,’ Howard says casually.
‘Oh brilliant John. And you have someone in mind who might know how to do that?’ the AEC guy says. Sarcastically, I think.
There’s a moment of silence, and then Howard and I say at the same time, ‘Turnbull.’ 
‘What’s Turnbull going to do?’ the AEC guy asks.
‘Pretty sure he invented computers mate,’ Howard says. 
‘And he’s running for parliament for the first time, so he’s got skin in the game,’ I say.
‘I don’t think it’s as simple as that,’ the AEC guy says.
‘I’ve got him on the phone now,’ Howard says, gesturing to us to be quiet.
Howard quickly explains the situation to Turnbull while we wait nervously around the toilet bowl. 
‘Ok, great. Just one second,’ Howard says. 
‘He can do it. But he wants something in return,’ Howard says to us, covering the phone with his hand. 
‘Can we offer him the PM job after Rudd?’ I suggest.
‘Nah, I owe a favour to Gillard,’ Richardson says.
‘And I’ve made a promise to Abbott,’ Howard says. ‘But maybe after that?’
We all nod in agreement.
Howard speaks to Turnbull again. ‘We’ve got a few people in line in front of you mate, but if we give everyone two terms, we could have something for you in 2025.’ 
There’s silence, and then, ‘Yep. Yeah mate. I know it’s a while. Yep, I know you’ll be in your 70s by then. Ok, hang on. Just hold the line for a sec.’
Howard looks at us, despairingly. It’s 5:57pm. 
‘I can speed things up from my end, cut it down to a term each,’ Richardson says.
‘Yep, me too,’ I say. 
Howard puts the phone back to his ear. ‘You there Mal? Ok, we reckon we can pull a few strings. How about 2016?’”

"Swinging on chairs leading cause of death, report nation’s teachers ","A new report released by the Association of Australian primary school teachers today has today revealed the shock new finding that swinging on chairs in school classrooms is the leading cause of death. 




Lead spokesperson of the group “Teachers for the Responsible Use of Chairs”, Wendy Rice, stated that chair swinging had overtaken other causes such as, drugs, illness and suicide. Like these causes, the chair-swinging epidemic needed the proper funding from government departments in order to slow the rise in deaths.
“Chair swinging is as addictive as drugs, as deadly as cancer and as self imposed as suicide. It’s the ultimate killer. Without four legs and two feet on the ground, no one is safe.”
Teachers across the country have praised the report. “With this report,” said Mr Taylor, “I have a reason other than just saying ‘you could fall and break your neck’, to tell students of the dangers of chair swinging. Although there are plenty of times that kids have broken their necks. I wasn’t exaggerating about that.”
Health minister Greg Hunt, has been floored by the findings of the report, suggesting “I almost fell off my chair… although I was leaning back on it.” Mr Hunt announced a new roll out of unswingable and unmoveable chairs will reach every school in Australia by the end of the year. “Unlike Gonski funding, the Liberal party is committed to making changes to Australian schools funding that actually matter, thus these new chairs will have a direct impact on the students of Australia and could save many lives in the future.

Former star of Skippy comes clean about carrot addiction that ruined his career ,"Former Star of Skippy the Bush Kangaroo – Joey Hops – has today opened up for the first time about his crippling addiction to carrots that cost him his job and his family at the height of his career. 




Stating that he felt obligated to speak out after seeing reports today in the news that tourists were being attacked by young Kangaroos hopped up on carrots, Joey says he wants to send a message to young Kangaroos everywhere about the dangers of carrot addiction. “It can start off so innocently,” says Joey. “It might even start with a less addictive substance, like apple slices or celery, but I know from experience that it’s not a path you want to jump down.”
“At first I did okay, I could cover it up, but pretty soon my family started noticing differences. If I didn’t get some beta carotene into me for twenty four hours I’d be hopping mad, and after a few months one day I came home to find my wife and kids had left. That should have been a sign that I needed to change, but by that point I was in too deep, those orange devils had their roots in me and I wasn’t going to get away easy.”
“That’just just how it goes though. One day you’re telling yourself you don’t have a carrot problem, the next you’re waking up in a hotel room with hundreds of empty spent bags of carrots on the floor,” says Hops, “and a dead hooker in your bed. It’s not pretty.”
The government has also announced drastic plans to curb Kangaroo carrot addiction today, unveiling a new TV advertising campaign that will highlight the dangers of carrot abuse. Ending with the tagline “Carrots – not even once” the TV spots will retell a number of stories of real life Kangaroos whose lives were ruined by a simple one time decision to eat carrots. One tells the story of a Roo who attacked a tourist in a fit of rage after they denied him his carrot fix, another tells the story of a Kangaroo who ran down an innocent bystander after deciding to drive following a night of drinking carrot juice at the local Boost store.
“It’s just a shame that it all had to end that way,” says Hops today from his jail cell. “It all could have been so different if I hadn’t chomped down on the orange fairy all those years ago. I was headed for a Hollywood career you know? I was getting offers for spots like ‘Kangaroo Number 1’ in Crocodile Dundee and I was even rumoured to be in the running to play the next Bond, but that all went up in smoke the day I started using C.

Victoria to offer free TAFE courses to 300 remaining Melbournians who aren’t qualified baristas ,"The Victorian government has today announced that it will be offering free TAFE courses to residents, in order to address growing unemployment in fields unrelated to artisanal macaroons. 




Telling reporters that “We might have enough qualified baristas at this point” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews then shouted ‘Skinny Flat White!’ before asking the journalists to stand to the side until their coffee is ready.
However, critics have questioned whether the move to re-skill Victoria’s workforce will be effective, given that the government is only offering free courses in specific understaffed areas. “I understand that we need people other than baristas for our economy to thrive,” says opposition leader Matthew Guy, “but I can’t help feeling that only offering free TAFE courses in ‘beard growing’, ‘cafe waiting’, and ‘staring artistically into the distance while turning the page of a book as you sip coffee in an alleyway restaurant’ might still be keeping our options a little too narrow.”
“Still, I guess it’s still better than that time we gave out all that free twine to help boost the sheering industry. Those giant balls of string are still roaming our streets. They killed three pedestrians last week.”",NaN,"May 2, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/barista.jpg,Fake
British backpacker ready for 7 day hike after half filling bottle of water ,"British backpacker William Huntington III has today set off on a seven day intensive hike through the Australian wilderness, fully equipped with thongs, a sandwich, some mosquito spray and a half-filled bottle of water. Wondering before he left if he might also need a map, compass, sunscreen or even some kind of preparation before embarking on a journey through Australia’s harsh and unforgiving landscape, William shrugged before explaining “Oh I’m sure it won’t be that hard, and worst case I can just call for some emergency help on my iPhone. They do have reception on the Overland Track don’t they?” 




Mr Huntington says he was inspired to undertake the adventure after hearing so many stories about people hiking on Australian TV. “Admittedly they were all stories about European travellers getting lost while out hiking,” says William, “but if it’s still such a popular passtime even though every second British person seems to die while doing it, my god it must be good!”
William also says that he has a plan to finish the hike in just three days, which will negate the need for heavy supplies like food or water. “Looking at the map I realised you can do the walk a lot faster if you don’t follow those winding trails and instead just do a bit of a bush bash directly in a straight line,” he says proudly. “I’m pretty sure I’ll be at the finish line by sundown if I just stay in a straight line. Don’t know why more people don’t do that.”
Mr Huntington says he has big plans for the extra time he’ll gain by taking shortcuts across the track. “I think I’ll spend those extra three days at a local pub drinking Fosters and laying out in the sun without suncream. Then on day two I’ll take a short drive in my $800 Toyota from Melbourne to Darwin, stopping off at Uluru along the way of course. Might also swing by Sydney to have a quick dip in Australia’s famous Bondi beach.”

Macron clarifies comment on Turnbull’s wife – “I just meant I’d sleep with her” ,"French President Emannual Macron has issued a formal apology to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull this evening, after mistakenly referring to the Prime Minister’s wife as “delicious” while giving a speech in Australia. The French President said he was “most embarrassed” about the gaffe, stating that he had simply mis-chosen his words and had meant to describe Turnbull’s wife as “How do you say… one smoking hot babe-alicious vixen who I’d give my right foot just to spend one night with.” 




“Am I translating that right?”
Prime Minister Turnbull has laughed off Macron’s earlier mistake, stating “Oh, you know, he probably just misspoke, after all English isn’t his first language. In fact I’m pretty sure he also messed up that part of our meeting where he asked why he’s ‘even meeting with this spineless leader of a third rate backwater British prison’. It’s a lot like how Matthias Cormann is always getting his English mixed up when he calls me a ‘pathetic girlyman’, or when my wife gets her English mixed up when she says I’m a ‘hollow shell of a human who’s only allegiance is to power and who would put his grandmother’s marriage to a plebiscite if it meant I could sit in the big boy’s chair for another day’, god bless that tongue tied wife of mine.”

"Uber Eats ordered to deliver fairer contracts, sweet and sour pork by ACCC ","Food delivery business and dystopian future cliche Uber Eats has today been summoned by the ACCC to deliver evidence, along with sweet and sour pork with fried rice, to the consumer watch dog’s headquarters following claims that the company has been forcing restaurants into unfair and illegal contracts. The ACCC delivered a statement to the press today announcing “Uber Eats has been accused of writing and enforcing unfair contracts on the businesses they deal with, and thus the ACCC will begin an investigation on these alleged practices, right after a succulent Chinese meal of course, wait should we get spring rolls for entree, or dumplings?” 




Uber Eats has since released its own press release, stating they will be complying with all the ACCC requests, with the popular food service hand delivering the evidence by way of an exploited foreign cyclist.
“Uber Eats are more than happy to deliver fresh evidence to the investigators at the ACCC,” said an Uber spokesman this afternoon, “and if the investigators find that any of the evidence isn’t fresh enough, or up to a suitable consumption standard, then we will be sure to refund them in full by forcing the supplier to pay the refund without evidence of wrongdoing.”
“Wait, shit, we’re the supplier!”
The ACCC have said they will take into account the cooperation of Uber Eats, with investigators stating they were impressed with Uber’s response to their requests. “We’ve never been able to track the delivery of our evidence before and watch in real time as it makes its way to our offices, this Miguel Sanchez really knows how to cycle through the city!”
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has told reporters that he was more than willing to work with investigators to clear Uber Eats name, as long as their offices “aren’t up some fucking hill, or more than a half hour drive from Uber HQ.”
Despite allegations of unfair working conditions, Uber cyclist Miguel Sanchez says that he hopes the investigation doesn’t see Uber Eats shut down. “Without Uber Eats I’d have to go back to Argentina,” says Sanchez, “or even worse, go and work for Foodora.”
Update: The ACCC has since announced they will be penalising Uber Eats, as their delivery was 10 seconds late.",NaN,"April 23, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/uber_eats.jpg,Fake
"Morrison denies opposing banking royal commission, “I had my fingers crossed” ","Scott Morrison has today strongly denied that he ever opposed a royal commission into the banking industry, suggesting that any time he may have sounded like he was against it, he actually had his fingers crossed behind his back. With statements such as calling the proposal for a banking royal commission in 2016 a “populist whinge”, and accusing Bill Shorten of playing “political games” by proposing the commission, Mr Morrison certainly made it look like he thought the commission was a bad idea, and when pressed on the issue Morrison said “ha ha, made you look you dirty chook.” 




“We at the Liberal party have always upheld the rules that if you cross your fingers while saying something you definitely don’t mean it”, said Morrison during Question Time today. “Just look throughout recent history – providing an NBN service that is cheaper and more effective than the Labor plan? Fingers crossed! Providing stable government that wouldn’t have the knifing and political back stabbing that encapsulated the labor party? Fingers crossed! Being a broad church of ideologies that isn’t dominated by political factions? You guessed it! Fingers crossed!”
“Also that time we said we’d give preferences to One Nation then had to furiously backpedal. Actually, no wait that one was gingers crossed.”
Political analysts have been rocked by this lack of transparency on party policy, with one analyst Joe Greenstone stating “This revelation of Liberal party policy, to not actually mean the things you say, would surely lead to some sort of lack of trust in its leaders, something that might mean they could start to lost some two party preferred polls, or even 30 in a row.”
Asked about sliding confidence in his party, and specifically his leader Mr Morrison stated “I unequivocally back the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull, and can assure you that me and the rest of the party caucus are 100% behind him, and there will be no more leadership spills within this party.”

Anger over “fee for no service” confuses politicians – “That’s what we do everyday?” ,"Malcolm Turnbull has today been blindsided by reports that charging consumers and supplying them no service was wrong, stating, “Oh God! But It’s what I do everyday!?” 




“I wasn’t aware that the taxpayers actually expect us to do things with their money, instead of pissing it away on worthless NBN infrastructure and plebiscites on very well known questions!”
Turnbull also expressed his disbelief that his job as Prime Minister actually required him to demonstrate leadership. “As the Prime Minister of Australia, I would feel ashamed in myself if actually provided any sort of management, knowledge, or even general backbone, for the eye-watering wage that the Australian people pay me each year. In fact the idea that I would be in this job for anyone but myself goes completely against the job description when I signed up.”
Mr Turnbull has also expressed his regrets at learning that his former colleagues in the banking industry had been found to be charging some customers for services for up to 10 years after they had died, exclaiming “Damn these charlatans, why did I not think of that!”
Turnbull has said he’s learned a valuable lesson from what he’s heard at the banking royal commission, pledging that the government would be introducing tough new tax laws as a result. “From now on our government will be doing everything in our power to chase down the biggest group of tax dodgers in this country, the deceased! They think they can get away with blatant tax avoidance, ha, over my undead body.”
Some reporters however have had questioned if Turnbull, a former merchant banker himself, was really in a position to comment on the fraudulent practices of an industry he had made millions of dollars out of, with one reporter at this afternoons press conference asking if Turnbull’s position isn’t “a bit rich”. However, Mr Turnbull hit back at any such allegations, retorting “No its pronounced WEALTHY, I’m a bit WEALTHY”, as he smiled condescendingly.
The press conference ended soon after, as Turnbull declared the royal commission an “Unprecedented success for the Liberal Party”. Turnbull then excused himself, explaining he had to phone some friends, before being overheard loudly whispering into his phone “Please, this isn’t our fault Gerald, it was all Labor’s idea!”",NaN,"April 20, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/confused_turnbull.jpg,Fake
"“Fraudulent bankers should be jailed, or made leader of Liberal party” says Morrison ","Liberal Treasurer Scott Morrison has today launched a stunning tirade against the Australian banking sector, following revelations at the Royal Commission into banking that sector had failed in their duties to the public. Stating that the actions of the big banks were “akin to robbery”, Morrison said that these greedy criminal bankers should be dealt with the only way the Liberal Party knows how – by making them Prime Minister of the country. 




“It’s always been my policy that banks and bankers should be held accountable to the law,” said Morrison this evening, “Even when I was opposing the Royal Commission into banking that was still very much my view. And now that all this has come out about the banks, well let me just say that the Liberal Party will be making dealing with this issue a top priority, right up until it moves out of the news cycle.”
However, former banking royal commission defendant and current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has sought to put the brakes on any hasty moves by his party, fearing that his own job may be on the line if the party is able to find richer and even more corrupt former bankers than himself.
“I think we as a country should all take a deep breath and a step back before doing something we all regret, like holding our wealthy to account for their actions,” announced Turnbull, before lighting up a cigar with a wad of $100 notes. “Personally I think the correct response right now is to do nothing, and if everybody is still outraged in six to eight months, I propose we deal with the bankers in a frank and concise manner, by putting their future to some kind of plebiscite. That should sort things out.”
Meanwhile former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has apologised publicly for opposing the Banking Royal Commission, stating that it was a massive failing on his part. “As someone whose sole job was regulation and overseeing the country’s wellbeing, I figured it was my duty to simply assume that everything going on in our financial sector was above board, even when all those news reports were saying otherwise,” said Barnaby at a press conference this morning from his new office/toilet cubicle at the back of Parliament House. “But now that even the banks themselves are saying that their staff acted in blatantly illegal ways, well I’m beginning to suspect that something not-quite-right may be going on in the banking sector. It’s just a hunch though at this point.”
However, opposition leader Bill Shorten has distanced himself from the findings of the Commission, stating that it was no way his intention that it would actually start producing results. “I didn’t think the Libs would actually call my bluff and start the investigation!” said a panicked Shorten this afternoon. “They were supposed to oppose it and end up looking like a bunch of out-of-touch suits! Now they’re basking in all the glory of sticking the boot into the banks, while I’m going to have to deal with the real fallout of the housing crash that these lending restrictions are going to cause. I mean, I guess I could try and lose the next election so I won’t have to deal with it, but Turnbull’s already well ahead of me on that front, I’ve got a lot of work to do if we’re going to out perform that mob on a fuckup-per hour basis.”

China to build military base 200km off Australian coast: ‘can’t afford the house prices any closer’ ,"Despite years of foregoing smashed avocado on toast, the Chinese military today announced that they will locate their first Pacific military base on the island of Vanuatu, 200 km off the coast of Australia. 




“It really is the closest we can afford on our budget,” said the Supreme Commander of the Joint Chinese Military Forces. “We looked at the outer suburbs of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, but even if we went interest-only, it’s a bit outside our price range.”

In a press release issued by the company this afternoon, Facebook said that it was “deeply sorry” that it had mislead its users on the issue and that the company was doing everything in it’s power to rectify the problem. 




“We’re introducing new policies that will make it easier to block your nudes from Mark Zuckerberg” said a notice appearing when people logged in to Facebook this afternoon, “as well as making it clearer for users exactly when our CEO is browsing through your personal messages, and just how hot he thinks you are without pants.”
“We’re also introducing a raft of new options under ‘privacy settings’ that will allow you to opt out of sharing your sexts with Facebook executives, with options ranging from disabling snooping from one to eight hours, guaranteeing you privacy as long as you remember to opt-in daily.”
The company however would not be drawn on whether these changes would extend to their second platform Instagram, stating that this was a separate and unrelated issue. “While we were initially concerned to learn that Mark had also viewed a number of user’s nude photos on that platform, we quickly realised that was simply the product working as intended, and these users had actually willingly and publicly shared those photos. In fact, it turns out the entire platform is almost entirely built around the public sharing of nudes, as a way of saving Mark from having to filter through all those inane conversations people were having.”

Hip priest desperately trying to shoehorn ball tampering reference into Easter sermon ,"Local youth minister Rev. Luke “Luko” Shepherd has today frantically started re-writing his Sunday mass sermon at the last minute, in an attempt to try and seem more hip and relatable to the fair-weather Christians that will be turning up on Sunday. Flipping through his Bible, Rev. Shepherd was seen desperately searching for any reference that could vaguely be used as a segue into a discussion of ball tampering, a topic which the priest hears is “all the rage” with the common man these days. 




“I’m not well versed in cricket per se,” says Rev. Shepherd, “however, most of the Christians who come to my church on easter aren’t well versed in the bible, so I really need to meet them halfway. Besides when it comes to religion, there’s no bigger one than sport in this country, might as well try to hitch our wagon to something like that rather than trying to compete. I’ve even started including regular updates on the football score during my sermon, just to cut down on the number of people subtly looking at their phone during prayer time.”
Rev. Shepherd also thinks that the cricket reference could find it’s way into his regular weekly sermons if it lands well on Sunday. “Sadly people these days, they’re just not as caught up in the whole ‘you’re going to burn in hell for all eternity‘ schtick,” says the Reverend, “and frankly the parables have all been done to death. Even my ‘the Matrix is a metaphor for Jesus’ material isn’t landing with the kids as much anymore.”
Instead Rev. Shepherd has turned to the internet for guidance, where he says he has found a great wealth of material to help his quest to save soles. “I’ve discovered a subreddit called ChristianMemes which has revolutionised my newsletter. Ever since I started including those pictures of Minions with bible passages written in big white text, our click-through rates have almost doubled, I don’t think we’d ever had eight clicks in the twelve years we’ve been sending out our daily church email! Last week we only had four people unsubscribe! Combine that with the bible puns we’ve been including on the letterboard out front, and I think we’re really going to start bringing the youth back to the Church.

Putin wins landslide victory with 120% of the vote ,"Russian President and part time house elf Vladimir Putin has today secured a stunning fourth term as President, a record unmatched in Russia since Stalin did away with the pageantry of staged elections in 1937. Taking to the stage to thank his supporters this evening, Putin glowered warmly at the crowd, telling them through tears of joy that if this election had proved anything, it’s that all who oppose him will die a slow and painful death. 




Putin’s camp had initially looked to be in for a beating at the polls, with RT reporting the President’s approval rating had dropped to a crushing 110% in the weeks leading up to the election. However in a surprise last minute save for Putin and his party, the opposition were declared enemies of the state and executed by the government, helping to secure a victory from the jaws of a slightly lesser victory.
The “Vlad 2018” campaign say they’re not surprised their message resonated with voters, and have put their record breaking win down to their party’s ever reliable platform of promising fairer taxes, better roads, and to brutally beat anyone who dares to vote for the opposition.
Putin has already received many warm congratulations for his victory from leaders around the world, from the Chinese President, who congratulated him on still putting up with the farce of democracy, to British Prime Minister May who told him to “savor every moment as if it were his last”, to American President Donald Trump who denied ever having heard of Putin.
Putin is said to be holding a small private election celebration tonight with the oligarch donors who backed his campaign, before their impending execution as enemies of the state early tomorrow morning.

Dutton: “What did white South Africans ever do wrong?” ,"Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has defended his comments that white farmers in South Africa “deserve special attention” from Australia, pointing out that the farmers “seem different” to most other asylum seekers, but he can’t quite put his finger on what it is. 




Unlike other asylum seekers who make up their genocides in order to get into the country to claim Centrelink benefits, white South African farmers are facing “horrific circumstances” and violence, Mr Dutton said.
“For a genocide to be horrific enough to qualify for special attention, you really need to feel some sort of sympathy for them. I can’t quite put my finger on why the white South Africans look more deserving of special attention, but as soon as I figure it out, I’ll get back to you.”
Mr Dutton said that merely facing the genocide of your entire race isn’t “horrific” enough to qualify for special attention from Australia, pointing out that Tamil Sri Lankans and Rohingyas from Myanmar don’t deserve any attention, and probably should just be sent home. “There’s some other ingredient that makes white farmers special, I can’t quite work out what it is,” Mr Dutton said. “But it’s not that they’re farmers.”
Mr Dutton added that the Australia he grew up with back when he was a Queensland cop has always had a special affinity with white South Africans. “It’s so unfair they’re being victimised.

However Mr Cooper, a TV reviewer, says that the commute home is often the the most gruelling part of his day, with the prospect of finally being able to get home and stare at a screen dampened by the fact that he first has to spend an hour on a cramped bus staring at a slightly smaller screen.
Once he gets home though, Cooper says he can finally unwind and unplug, by pulling out his work laptop and answering all the work emails he’s received since leaving the office. “Once that’s done I’m free to put my feet up and stream a few episodes of the my favorite shows,” says Cooper. “Well, you know, once I’ve scrolled through the entire Netflix library about four times to find something that looks moderately interesting, checked Reddit, answered a few more emails, and clicked ‘maybe’ on all my Facebook invites for the day.”
Sometimes staring at computers all evening can be a bit much though, explains Copper, leading him to re-kindle his love for older, more traditional forms of entertainment. “Once a week I’ll give my eyes a rest and I’ll cave-man it by watching some free-to-air TV instead,” he says, “or read my kids a story on the iPad.”
“That’s pretty rare though these days,” explains Cooper, “They’re always tied up on their Gameboys or playing Playstation. Kids these days eh? Can’t get them away from the screens for some reason.”",NaN,"March 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shutterstock_519514462.jpg,Fake
"Anti-corporate hippy completes image with $70,000 Kombi campervan ","Local new-age hippy and part time financial consultant Wendy “Starchild” Roberts has today taken the final step in her journey to becoming a free-spirited anti-corporate hippy, with an investment in a fully refurbished Kombi Campervan for just $70,000, plus insurance. 




“It’s always been my dream to throw off the shackles of modern capitalist society, hit the road, and travel around Australia meeting strange and wonderful people while sharing authentic human experiences without all the trappings of modern city life,” explained Wendy, “But I’ll probably do that in a modern campervan, because this Kombi doesn’t have air-con and honestly this one’s mostly just for show.”
Ms Roberts says that the campervan is a great way of sending a message that she is the type of person who cares about the earth and the damage we’re doing to it on a daily basis. “My ‘Save the Earth’ bumper stickers really help get the message across to other drivers that global warming is real and it’s happening,” says Wendy, “as does the the thick cloud of lead infused smog that the Kombi’s constantly churning out of it’s exhaust pipe.”
However friends of Ms Roberts say this is unlikely to be a sound investment, saying that they have seen all this before when it comes to chasing trends. “She’ll be over it in about a month when she gets sick of having to constantly tend to her wash-out dreadlocks,” says Ms Roberts’ brother Mike, “This is just like her metal phase when she bought up all those leather jackets that she never wore, or that over-leveraged Hyundai she burned all that money on during her Uber driver phase.”
Ms Roberts however has hit back at such claims, stating that she was in every way fully on-board with the hippy thing, and it isn’t just a phase. “Just look at my new ripped jeans from Tree of Life,” says Ms Roberts. “Or my new Persian sarong from Tree of Life, or these scented sandlewood candles from Tree of Life. Does that sound like I’m just trend chasing to you?”
Ms Roberts has since booked a $20,000 vacation to India to further prove her brother wrong, where she will be spending three weeks travelling the country seeking enlightenment, rebirth, and cheap weed.",NaN,"March 4, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kombi.jpg,Fake
Mardi Gras ends at 7pm as married couples decide to call it a night ,"The annual Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras has today been called off early, as the large number of now married attendees decided that it was getting late at 7pm, and that it was “probably time to call it a night.” 




“It’s been lovely,” explained the couples, smiling politely while checking their phones, “but you know, we’ve got an early start tomorrow, so we’d best be getting home to the kids, god knows the baby sitter isn’t cheap!”
“We weren’t really after a big night anyway,” explained one couple putting away their biscuits and dip in a cooler bag. “Sure getting drunk and partying wildly is fine when you’re young but you know the parade’s been going for 40 years now, and our idea of a celebration these days is more along the lines of getting a few friends around for some a glass of wine and a nice cheese platter, and being in bed by 9.”
However the exit of the parade’s gay and lesbian attendees surprisingly made almost no difference in the number of people marching, with witnesses soon realising that the once political and radical parade was now almost entirely made up of excitable teenage girls and corporate floats manned by open-minded straight people who were just looking for a fun night out in an otherwise mind-numbing city.
“Look we didn’t want to say anything, but the parade’s actually been entirely straight for years, at least since we had to bring in corporate sponsors after we went bankrupt in the early 2000s,” explained Mardi Gras organisers. “Companies like ANZ and Star Casino weren’t too keen on being associated with a large political protest aligned with radical-left wing ideologies, so we quietly sidelined all the gays and just brought in a bunch of shirtless straight bodybuilders to march instead. Thank god we did too, because ever since the gays started getting married they’ve really let themselves go.”",NaN,"March 3, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mardi_gras_over.jpg,Fake
Barnaby Joyce to join Fred Nile at Mardi Gras praying for sanctity of marriage ,"Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has today joined the Reverend Fred Nile in his annual prayer for rain at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, in a move he said was a last ditch attempt to “defend the sanctity of marriage” from people who would seek to turn it into some kind of lifelong commitment of devotion and love instead of the cold transfer of property between two men, as God intended it to be. 




Standing in a prayer circle at Taylor Square, Barnaby, his wife, and his mistress joined hands with Reverend Nile to beg that God help prevent gay and lesbian people from happily entering long term committed relationships, and instead return marriage to its natural form, like Reverend Nile’s second marriage to a woman twenty years his junior.
“If God wanted gay and lesbian people to be happy he wouldn’t have created bigots,” Reverend Nile told the press this afternoon, before being hit with a freak 1 meter square burst of rain seemingly aimed directly at him. “And if we let gay people carry on with this charade, what’s next? Letting them pay taxes, or join the army? Well not on my watch. And trust me, I’m watching every single one of those videos they upload on the internet very closely.”",NaN,"March 2, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/joyce_prayer-1024x576.jpg,Fake
Grandma wishes grandson a “Very happy sent from my iPhone” ,"Local Grandmother and part time telemarketing victim Dorothy Hayes has today embraced the digital age, using her brand new Apple iPhone to wish her 14 year old grandson a “Very happy sent from my iPhone.” 




Leaving the birthday/gratuitous marketing message on her grandson’s Facebook wall, Dorothy also took the opportunity to catch up on all 500 of her grandson’s tagged photos, liking every single one of them, and commenting with 500 variations of “look Like.. fun… timmy,, Love grandma… xxx.”
However grandson Timothy was less than impressed, stating that he would have much preferred the usual postcard packed with unmarked $5 bills than the heart attack of seeing a sea of his dickhead mates liking and replying to his grandmother’s messages on Facebook.
“Thank fuck she doesn’t know what gilf means,” says Timmy “or I’m pretty sure I’d be disowned by her.”
“When she brought it up on my last visit after reading Robbo’s “kind message” from a screenshot of my Facebook wall that she had somehow printed out, I nearly died. I told her it means ‘Grandma I’ll love forever’ once I managed to pick myself up off the floor, but if she one day learns how to use Google without accidentally loading Media Player, I’m done for.”",NaN,"March 2, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/grandma_phone.jpg,Fake
Landlord hopes young tenants won’t decrease value of massively overinflated shitbox ,"Local landlord Michelle Toohey has today expressed fears to colleagues that the four new tenants she has accepted into her 2 bedroom, one story, $1500 per week apartment, will possibly decrease the property’s value, due to the actions of the young first time renters. 




Explaining her fears, Ms Toohey says that while she understands young people do need to live somewhere, she’d rather hold out for a rich boomer to rent the property to, as they are much less likely to do damage to the crumbling, asbestos ridden shitbox. “That measly apartment was the ugly duckling of my 5 other investment properties, I don’t think I would even let my dog rent there,” says Ms Toohey, “but I’ll be damned if any of those millennials think they can get away with adding to the various holes that already litter the walls! I’m going to be keeping a close eye on them, and if I find even one lick of paint has been used to cover up the mold in the living room, so help me god they’ll never see that bond again.”
Ms Toohey has long been hesitant to put the small, dimly lit apartment on the market, fearing that she may be forced to deal with the uninsulated wires in the bathroom, however with Sydney house prices beginning to slow in their incline, and Ms Toohey desperately needing a third holiday to Bali this year, she decided that the extra income could do her some good. “Previously I just sorta let the market increase the value of the place week by week, no need to clean it, or upkeep it,” says Ms Toohey, “the market was a really good tenant and I’ll be sad to see it go.”
Asked whether she thought that there was a possibility that the housing market in Sydney may cool down, Ms Toohey responded by saying “No no, theres no air conditioning in the apartment, you will have to pay extra for that, just get a fan or something,” while sitting under the brand new air conditioner her rental income is paying for.
Ms Toohey is hoping that through her tireless work of having all her properties handed down to her by relatives, and this new Bitcoin thing that her son showed her, she will be able to retire early and live off the income of the lazy millennials that live in her apartments.",NaN,"February 28, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/house_2-1024x566.jpg,Fake
Local Idiot Puts Phone and Wallet in Same Pocket ,"Local dimwit Guy Perry has today been lambasted by mates, after he was seen placing both his wallet and his phone in the same pocket – a move described by witnesses as “just bizarre”. Asked about the unconventional choice of pocket organisation, Mr Perry said it was something he had done “all his life” and he isn’t about to change things now just because “some brainiac from the pocket patrol” had come up with a better alternative. 




“Phone and leather stay together,” recited Perry, seemingly believing that was a saying that actually exists, “that way you have space for all the other things that may need to go in your other pockets, such as spare coins, receipts and the odd loose piece of string”, he said, as he slid his house and car keys agonisingly into his back pockets.
Mr Perry insists he does not buy into the hype of the weirdness of his pocket placement position, stating that he was pretty sure this trend is going to catch on eventually. “I guess you could say I’m an innovator”, Mr Perry stated, as his earphones got pulled out due to his flailing hand gestures, and his inability to tuck them into his shirt.
Asked about whether having a phone and a wallet in the same pocket felt uncomfortable, Mr Perry shook his head. “Look how big my wallet is, still got my school card from when i was in year 7, and a library card I haven’t used since 2005. If i can fit that behemoth in my pocket alongside my phone then I’m pretty sure anyone should be able to do it comfortably,” he said as he took his wallet out, causing his phone to slip out and smash on the floor.
“Fuck!” said Perry. “There goes screen number 4.”

McCormack Passes Final Nationals Leadership Test by Failing to Disclose Entitlements ,"Michael McCormack has today stepped firmly into his role as the leader of the National Party of Australia, after he successfully failed to disclose entitlements to Parliament. During his maiden speech today as Deputy PM, McCormack stated that he had “studied from the greats – from Barnaby Joyce to Matt Canavan”, and that he is ready for his final test of being found not to be a citizen of Australia, “just like those that came before me.” 




“I knew it was going to be a tough challenge for me, seeing as unlike those two I am neither a dual citizen, or am remotely known by the Australian public, but I stuck to my guns, and today I am proud to announce I have taken up citizenship of Lichtenstein, and will now be heading to the high court for my ceremonial re-election hearing, as is the process for all Nationals Leaders.”
Friends of McCormack say that the role of Deputy of the National party was one that he was born to fill, and that ever since he was a child he had been practicing as hard as he could to forget what the property he owned in Melbourne, whether it was just an investment property or if it was a rental income property, and “today that hard work payed off.”
McCormack had previously made his way to the final stages of National Party Leadership Knockout (NPLK), after excelling in all the competition’s fields, including horse riding, hat wearing, and lefty shooting. Mr McCormack was also awarded a 10/10 in the blind tinny tasting competition, where he impressed onlookers by being able to taste the difference between a Tooheys New in a blue can or a Tooheys New in a white can, a feat not seen in an Australian cabinet member since Bob Hawke was first appointed as the Minister for Education in 1975.
Asked on whether he believed that his successor would be up for the job, former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce indicated he had been “very impressed” by Mr McCormack, however he did have some doubts about his mental fortitude. “I’m just not sure if he will be able to take the intense media pressure that comes with the position,” Joyce told reporters this afternoon, “or the smoking hot political staffers that come with the position, he’s gonna really need to screw his staff….ugghhh head on correctly if hes gonna be a successful leader. Will he be able to juggle the demands of the job with the stress of looking after his children, wife, mistress, and love child? Only time will tell I guess.”",NaN,"February 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/0ac616ac52ffacda38ef2d3728f69420-1024x576.jpg,Fake
“I’m not afraid of shooters” tweets Trump from bullet proof car ,"Donald Trump has today consoled the grieving families of the recent Florida school shooting, after the President informed the bereaved parents that their children are still very much alive in the alternative reality that he inhabits inside his head. 




Speaking through a crack in the window of his bulletproof car this evening, Trump wove the families a stunning and heroic tale in which he personally rushed into the Florida school mid-shooting and tackled the shooter, saving the children inside – interspersed with various scenes he half-remembered from the movie Rambo.
“The guards there were completely useless, what kind of wimp runs away from combat!?” compained the man who famously dodged the draft five times. “If I were there I would have used my blackbelt Judo skills to sneak into the vents into the school, working my way through them using photographic memory of the school floorplan, before dropping silently behind the shooter and putting him in a sleeper hold, as all the children applauded and told how impressive my rippling six-pack is. Also I would have a talking dog.”
“But that’s just the kind of guy I am, never afraid of a bit of danger,” said the man who has an entire arm of government dedicated to his 24/7 protection. “You know if I heard a place being shot up, I really believe I’d run in there, even if I didn’t have a weapon. After sending in a few teachers first to distract the guy though, of course.”
“Some people are just soft though,” said the 239 pound man who spends his nights picking fights on Twitter while eating KFC in his silk draped bed. “It’s a shame we can’t all be brave war heroes like me.”
Trump then cut the interview short and fled the scene crying, after somebody in the crowd pointed out that his hands were slightly smaller than average",NaN,"February 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/trump_car-1024x624.jpg,Fake

Republican party implodes after abortion performed with gun ,"WASHINGTON The GOP is in damage control this evening following an attempt by party hardliners to outlaw abortion, a move that major GOP donor the NRA has decried as “stomping on every American’s right to shoot pregnant women in the chest.” 




The NRA has demanded that the Republican party halt any further attempts to outlaw abortion, and roll back any existing laws against the practice, which they say is a clear imposition on the second amendment rights of the country’s crazed mass murderers.
“This is pure discrimination” said NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch this afternoon. “If I want to walk into the maternity ward of a hospital with a semi-automatic rifle and let off a bit of steam by shooting a few prospective mothers at point blank range, killing them and their unborn children in the process, what right does the government to stop me? What’s next? Banning the sale of hunting rifles to ten year olds? Restricting the mentally ill from stocking up on AK-47s? Well that’s the kind of horrible nightmare future we’re headed for if we take even one step on to this slippery slope, and I’ll die by the hand of my 10 year old who mistook the gun in my purse for a toy before I start considering putting restrictions on the rights of my fellow countrymen.”
However the Republican party have defended their stance, stating that some things were more important that the right to bear arms. “The rights of an unborn child are sacrosanct.” said Republican elder Mitch McConnell this afternoon. “We must do every single in our power to ensure the wellbeing of our innocent, defenceless children. That is, up until the moment they leave their mother’s womb. After that feel free to shoot them till your heart’s content.”
Mr McConnell also would not be drawn on recommendations that laws be introduced banning the sale of semi-automatic guns to school children, stating that these weapons have many legitimate child-killing purposes, and that they shouldn’t be tainted by a minority of people who use them to kill children who haven’t been born. “That’s just the problem with kids these days,” says McConnell, “they’re all too coddled. Well I’ve got news for you kids, some people are crazed serial killers and it’s not doing any of you good to shield you from the realities of life. This is just another namby pamby safe space policy with liberals trying to turn our schools into places where a person can’t even walk in and shoot up a classroom without some snowflake getting all up in arms about it. Well guess what, back in my day I was shot all the time and you never hear me complaining. Admittedly my day was the 1700s and guns could barely pierce the skin, but my point still stands – we must protect our children from murderers, but also we need to let murderers keep killing children, as is their right.”",NaN,"February 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mcconnel-1024x538.jpg,Fake
"Password tried again with number, capital ","Local Baby Boomer and part time internet explorer Janet Williams has today given in and reset her password on her joint Facebook with her her husband, after every single possible password she could think of failed – from the word ‘password’ with a capital, to the word ‘password’ followed by the number ‘1’. 




Attempting alternative ways into her account also proved to be in vain, as Janet’s friendly requests to change her password were rejected by Facebook as well. “At first I tried changing the password to ‘password’ so it would be easy to remember,” says Janet, “after all it’s my password to everything else, but Mr Facebook rejected it, telling me I’d already used that password in the last 12 months. So then I tried ‘password1’ but it failed too, because apparently you need a capital. So THEN I tried ‘Password1’ but that ALSO failed, because apparently you also need 25 characters, a batman symbol, three different French words for cheese and a rainman like memory for passwords.”
Jannet eventually opted to just forgo logging into Facebook entirely, instead deciding to just flip through a women’s magazine featuring many flawless models taking expensive holidays around the world. “It’s just easier this way,” says Janet, “and it has pretty much the same debilitating effect on my self esteem.”
Sources later confirmed that Janet did manage to find her way into her account, after her “techno savy” grandson reminded her for the third time that the password was written on a Post-It note, attached to her computer monitor, with the words “Your Facebook Password” written in capital letters above it.",NaN,"February 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/password.jpg,Fake
Nationals enter bold new era under leadership of some guy ,"The National Party has decisively put the Barnaby Joyce era behind it, electing a new leader named Cormack McMichaels or Cormack McCarthy or MacMichael Cormack or Carmichael or something. 




The new leader won over his colleagues by not having impregnated a staffer, not having New Zealand citizenship, not having accepted a rental property from a prominent donor and not being accused of sexual harassment. The party welcomed the chance to appoint a leader with an entirely clean slate as far as the public is aware, which is, in his case, not at all.
The Member for Riverina, or somewhere around there, overwhelmingly defeated North Queensland MP George Christensen, who is far better known than the new leader, but mostly for that inadvertently homoerotic photoshoot with the singlet and the whip.
Christensen broke with many years of Nationals tradition by contesting a ballot for leader, but blamed it on a simple misunderstanding. “I thought I was running for the leadership of One Nation,” he said. “But it was for the Nationals — of which I’m a proud member, right until the moment I jump ship.”
The victorious McThingummy was thought to have jeopardised his chances last week when he had an embarrassingly awkward interview on live TV. Fortunately for him, the appearance was on Sky News, so nobody saw it.
Barnaby Joyce wished his new boss well, but admitted it would be a challenge being led by the new leader. “I’m just not sure which one he is.”
Mr Joyce said he would challenge the guy, you know, that McThingamijig, after the next election. “Nothing personal. It’s just that with five kids, I really need that $400,000 salary.”
The Deputy Leader of the Nationals, Senator Bridget McKenzie, wasn’t asked for comment, or to run, as per standard practice.
The prime minister welcomed the new leader. “I look forward to meeting whatshisname soon, and pretending to give shit about issues that are important to the National Party, so I can keep their votes.”",NaN,"February 26, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_79571515.jpg,Fake
Local school student rushed to hospital after accidentally calling teacher “mum” ,"Local student James Marshall has today been rushed to hospital after suffering a grade 3 cringe attack. 




“It just came out of nowhere,” said James from his hospital bed this afternoon. “I was trying to ask a simple question about whether I could go to the bathroom when I heard the word ‘mum’ come out of my mouth. It was like I was watching the whole thing unfold from outside my body. The whole class heard me, and even the teacher cracked a joke at my expense, reminding me not to forget to get her something for Mothers’ Day. I just don’t know if I can go on anymore.”
Doctors say this is one of the worst cases of traumatic childhood experiences they have seen, and that they have been forced to quarantine James for fear it may spread. “Within minutes of James arriving in the ER and explaining what happened, we had three patients and one doctor struck down with embarrassing memories of thing they’d done in front of their school classrooms.” says head surgeon Dr. Blake Madeup. “At this rate of contagion we may be facing an epidemic of levels we haven’t seen since the ‘Turning up in fancy dress on the wrong day’ plague of ’04.”
Mr Marshall was reportedly euthanized by doctors shortly later to put him out of his misery, after he accidentally asked a nurse “Mum, is that you?” while waking up from an induced coma.

Mosman camper accidentally experiences nature while traveling between car and caravan ,"Mosman locals and part time trust-fund managers Trudy and Bartholomew Smithington have today made a joint visit to their GP for booster shots, after a harrowing experience which saw them exposed to nature for 20 seconds as they travelled between their all-terrain family mover, and their luxury campervan during a recent camping trip. 




Wandering out into natural sunlight for the first time in weeks, the pair were temporarily forced to breathe unfiltered air like peasants as they frantically searched for a missing bottle of Merlot ’87.
The experience is said to have left Mrs Smithington shaken and “deeply scarred” after she was forced to turn down an offer to join a game of volleyball by nearby campers. “Just the thought of getting sand and dirt on these expensive Versace heels makes me feel physically ill,” says Trudy, “What’s next? Eating one of their charcoaled steaks off their filthy germ-ridden campside barbecues, or messing up my manicured nails trying to pull one of those burnt marshmallows off of a filthy stick? No, I go camping to relax in scenic natural surroundings from the safety of 2-inches of bulletproof glass, not to experience the outdoors first hand like some kind of cave-man.”

Scientists discover parallel universe where USBs can be inserted after only 2 tries ,"Scientists at the Harvard University have today unveiled a groundbreaking discovery which is set to revolutionise modern computing, after researchers discovered a parallel universe in which people are able to plug in a USB device after only a single try. “As everybody in our own timeline knows, it is against the laws of physics to be able to plug a USB into your computer in less than four tries,” said the press release. “However, using this new discovery we now believe it may be possible to create a USB that can be plugged in after only 3 or maybe even 2 tries one day.” 




The researchers have gone to great lengths however to emphasise that the discovery is currently purely theoretical, and it may be years before any workable product is able to leave the lab. “There are many potential downsides of introducing such a product that we may not be aware of,” warned physicist Stephen Hawking. “For all we know introducing such a device into our own universe might tear a hole in the very fabric of spacetime, and we could all be killed by the torrent of missing pens and sunglasses that have been slipping into that dimension since the 1950s.”
The researchers say the technology is not limited to USBs, and could potentially be applied in a number of unrelated fields. “We’re currently working on a number of different products based on the research,” said lead researcher Tom Thomson this morning. “From backpack zippers that don’t get caught on the fabric, to hotel showers that don’t go straight from freezing to boiling, to toasters that don’t burn the toast even though they’re on the same setting as yesterday, this technology really could revolutionise the way we live our lives.”",NaN,"February 23, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/usb-1024x649.jpg,Fake
IT worker spends relaxing holiday answering work emails from different timezone ,"Local highly qualified IT worker and office iPhone repairman Greg Thompson has today taken three weeks off of his high pressure job to spend some downtime answering his emails from Europe for a change. Stating that he had been looking forward to this much needed vacation for weeks now, Greg has thrown off the shackles of his 9-5 job and is now looking forward to dealing with the various major technical issues that plague his company at 3am instead of his regular office hours. 




Before leaving, Greg says he made sure to draw a line in the sand with colleagues to ensure he gets a little “me time”, having set an auto-responder on his outlook account explaining that he may take up to two hours to reply seeing as he is now officially on holidays.
“It’s just great to get away from the stress of being in an office and instead spend some time being stressed on the beach for a change.” Greg told family this afternoon. “I’m also loving the challenge of trying to explain to Janet how to use emojis on her phone via email instead of in person for once. Maybe now that it’s written down she’ll finally remember how to do it, though that would probably require her to work out how to open emails on her phone.”
Asked what he would be doing with the three hours a day of his holiday that won’t be spent dealing with the various technical issues caused by his absence, Greg says he’ll be spending his time just relaxing and unwinding. “I’ll probably spend a few hours mindlessly scrolling through Reddit, then maybe binge watch a few Nexflix series while I wait for the boss to wake up and start emailing,” says Greg. “All in all I’ll be just making the most of the many great wifi connections Europe has to offer.”",NaN,"February 23, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_222768685.jpg,Fake
Plan to go to bed at reasonable hour foiled by lure of doing nothing in particular for 5 hours ,"Local university student Sam Williams has today decided to stay up until 3am, in an effort to catch up on all the YouTube videos she has missed out on over the last 12 years.

“On top of that there’s also the twelve episodes of the latest Netflix series that I need to work my way through tonight. God knows they won’t still be there tomorrow.”
Though she had previously pledged that 2018 would be the year she would start getting up at 6am and going to the gym every morning, Sam says that she has not given up the plan, and is simply taking a few months off to treat herself. “I’ve still got the $150 gym subscription, so that will hopefully motivate me eventually,” says Sam “And I’ve set my alarm for 6am so odds are I’ll be up and ready for action in the morning.”
Update: Sam could not be reached for comment this morning to confirm the quality of her decision, on account of deciding to sleep in as “I can probably afford to miss another class, after all it’s only the seventh I’ve missed this week.”",NaN,"February 23, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/phone_bed.jpg,Fake

Joyce resigns to spend more time with his various families ,"Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has announced that he will be resigning from his role as head of the Nationals this afternoon, stating that he would instead be focusing on spending more time with his love children. 




Announcing his resignation this afternoon in front of a packed press circle, Barnaby said it was a matter of prioritising his limited time. “For too long I’ve been splitting my attention between my work, and my family, and my other more secret family,” said a clearly emotional Barnaby this afternoon. “I don’t feel like I’ve been the father that I should have been to my five children, nor the husband I should have been to my five secret wives.”
Barnaby has insisted that this was a decision he made on his own, and went to great lengths to clarify that this was in no way related to the ongoing calls for him to resign coming from the public, his party, his colleagues, his electorate, and his prospective father-in-law this week. “The fact is that it’s just the right time to hand over the reigns,” said Joyce. “Sometimes when the universe unveils that you’re illegally a citizen of another country, that your mistress is pregnant, and that you’re facing sexual harassment allegations, you’ve just got to take the hint that the universe is giving you. And then hold on for two more weeks just to make sure something else doesn’t come along to distract the public’s attention.”
Barnaby has also taken the opportunity to express his deepest condolences to all those that have been hurt or damaged by his actions, stating that it was never his intention, and that from now on he chooses to live as a gay man.",NaN,"February 23, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/joyce_interview-1024x576.jpeg,Fake
Safety Warning Convinces Man Not To Drink Paint ,"Local DIY repairer Ron Bakershmitt has been saved from serious embarrassment at the last minute today, after spotting a warning label on the can of Dulux Colourbond he was about to drink. 




“You know, without the warning that this tin of high-gloss enamel contains deadly chemicals, I was totally down for a few shots with the boys after a hard day of house repairs,” says Ron from his new outdoor deck this afternoon. “I’d even prepared a nice plate of asbestos-drywall chunks as a delicious side snack, and a bit of in-roof insulation for the kids. But after seeing the label warning that consumption may lead to death, I decided I’d give it a miss and just opt for a regular old glass of Tide detergent instead. You might think it’s not meant to be drunk but it still tastes better than anything you’d get at Starbucks.”
When asked why he was considering drinking from a tin of green sludge, Ron explained that it was just part of Australian culture to drink things which taste like their primary purpose is as an industrial chemical. “I’ve been drinking strange seemingly inedible liquids for years now,” said Ron. “From the foggy brown sludge of Guiness, to eye watering soil-flavoured paint-stripper we call whiskey, if we were judging drinks on how much they seem like they should never be consumed, then I’m pretty sure my local pub would go broke in a week.”",NaN,"February 20, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/label-1024x682.jpg,Fake
Chinese New Year late again ,"The nation of China collectively lost it’s shit today, as it woke up to realise that once again it’s alarm had failed, and that the world’s most populous country had completely missed new years by over a month. 




Hopping out the door on one leg as they attempted to pull up and button their jeans, China frantically tried to simultaneously down an entire cup of breakfast cereal, while also sloppily texting out “FUCK, SORRY! Running a few minutes late!” with their free hand.
The rest of the world is reportedly not impressed with China’s tardiness, saying while they love China and it’s devil-may-care attitude to life, sometimes it can be frustrating being related, with their tendency to always turn up late to events. “Look, it was fine once or twice, sometimes busses are late, or you get caught out,” said China’s long time best friend North Korea yesterday, “but you know this has been going on for years now. I’ve even had to start organising New Years two months early just to make sure China turns up on time, and even then somehow they’re still late.”
China’s friends say they are even considering an intervention if China doesn’t get it’s act together. “It was fine when you were younger, sleeping in past February each year is almost expected of you then.” says an as of yet undelivered letter drafted by China’s friends Russia and Mongolia. “But you’re a grown up country now, with jobs and kids and a dog, you can’t just keep putting off major life events like this.”
But China has hit back at the allegations, stating that they just have a different work schedule and other countries need to respect that. “Besides, I may be a few months late getting to the new year,” said China defensively, “but at least I’m IN 2018, unlike some OTHER countries who decided to revert back to 1950, looking at you America.”

Opinion: Sex is unnatural and should have been banned years ago ,"by Firth, Host of The Firth Factor
Malcolm Turnbull is right to have banned sex. After all, sex is totally unnatural, and the way I think about it, it’s also totally disgusting.
For years Canberra has been awash with sex out in the open. I know it’s hard to imagine how anyone even considered having sex in the same place that Clive Palmer once sat, but it’s true.
An unspoken agreement between both sides of politics meant nobody batted an eyelid — unless that was the signal to leave for the night.
In fact, for many politicians, sex with staffers had become a routine event. Like filing a travel allowance claim, or leaking against a colleague.
Now, thanks to Malcolm Turnbull the quality of sex at Parliament House will be massively improved.
What used to be mundane and out in the open, is now strictly against the rules.
Politicians may even need to be punished over and over again if they are naughty and break the rules.
The long term effects are even better. Most politicians are incredibly ugly. By banning them from having sex, it will solve the epidemic of ugly children that is ruining Australian schools and beaches.
Of course, some negative nellies say the ban goes too far and that only sex with Bob Katter should be banned.
But the ban totally solves the problem that has been a major distraction this week.
The problem was that Barnaby was having sex with a staffer and so he got a job for her down the corridor.
Now, if Barnaby wants to have sex with a staffer he’ll have to get a job for her down the corridor before they have sex.
Problem solved.

Joyce spends romantic Valentines Day denying significance of relationship ,"Barnaby Joyce has today been spotted in a local Tamworth newsagent, demanding to know why they don’t stock “To my impregnated friend who I subsequently developed feelings for” cards. 




“Look it’s pretty simple mate,” Barnaby was heard yelling at staff. “We were long term friends in existing relationships who didn’t love each other but would occasionally have sex on my office desk. Then the day after she stopped working in my office I fell deeply in love with her so I divorced my wife, so I could be with the woman who I now loved who also happened to be three months pregnant with my love child. It’s pretty simple mate, as if you don’t have a card for that.”
Local residents say Joyce eventually settled on buying a blank Valentines card and a sharpie, penning his own romantic message to his pregnant partner. “To my long term sexual partner,” Barnaby was heard muttering under his breath, “who I until recently had no feelings for. I’ve loved you since the day you first stopped technically working for me. There, that should do it.”
Joyce and his partner were later seen out in town, hand in hand, spending the day romantically denying their long term relationship to anyone who asked. “Us? Oh no, we just met,” the couple laughed happily when asked by an old lady if the baby was due soon. “And the fact that we’re having a child together should not be misconstrued as indicative of the length or former nature of our relationship.”
Joyce also told interested onlookers that he has a full romantic evening planned out for the couple, today being their three week anniversary. “First I’ve organised a candle-lit dinner for us both, charged as a business lunch to the taxpayer of course,” explained Barnaby. “Then I’ve sprinkled a carpet of roses leading to my office for a steamy session of purely platonic, unromantic sex. And then we’ll cap off the night back at our all expenses paid loveshack, snuggled up on the sofa, drinking some red wine as we’re warmed by the charred burning remains of what’s left of my political career.”

“Gays are destroying marriage” Joyce tells pregnant mistress ,"Barnaby Joyce has today launched a stunning tirade against gay people and the damage their relationships are doing to the institution of marriage, calling them “promiscuous” and “unholy”. Stating that he would do everything in his power to bring an end to this un-biblical atrocity, Barnaby then rolled over in bed and asked his pregnant mistress “and so what are you up to today honey?” 




The news of Barnaby’s tirade has come as no surprise to those who know the Deputy Prime Minister, who say he has always been a tireless campaigner for the institution of marriage. “From the time he warned that Asia wouldn’t take us seriously if we legalised gay-marriage, to the time he told marriage equality campaigners to get out of people’s faces, Barnaby has always put traditional marriage first,” said one of his staffers “In between times when he’s not cheating on his wife that is.”
Banaby has also hit back against potential criticism of his position, stating that he was simply taking the everyman view to the issue of gay marriage, which is that Australians are sick of hearing about gay-rights. “I just wish homosexual people didn’t want to rub their relationships in our faces,” said the man who’s most recent sexual relationship was blasted out on the front page of every major national newspaper. “If there’s one thing they could learn from me, it’s a lesson about keeping their unholy relationships on the down-low.”

"Can’t afford a house in Sydney or Melbourne? Just get one rent-free from a millionaire donor, says Joyce ","Barnaby Joyce has slammed millennials for complaining about housing affordability in Sydney and Melbourne, saying they should just do what he does. 




“It’s very simple,” he told a group of millennials on Friday. “All you have to do is get a house rent-free from an influential political donor. Problem solved.”
He admitted there was more steps than just that. “First of all, you have to leave your wife and kids,” he admitted, “then just shack up with your new girlfriend. Then you tap someone from the local community who happens to want influence with you.”
“The best thing is that even though it sounds deeply corrupt, it’s actually 100% legal, as long as you declare it on your parliamentary register,” he told millennials. He added that it was prudent to not mention exactly who the donor was — just like he failed to do.
He said he also had little sympathy for millennials who were struggling to afford other household expenses on their own income. He pointed out the solution was simple. “Simply get a mate to give your partner a lucrative job in their office. That way you’ll have double the income, all funded by the taxpayer!”",NaN,"February 10, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1517998766667_GJO1EVN96.1-0.jpg,Fake
New senator Jim Molan justifies punching baby in the face as “starting a debate” ,"New Liberal senator Jim Molan has today responded to complaints about him repeatedly punching a baby in the face during his maiden speech in parliament, stating he stood by his actions as they were “helping to start a debate” about the benefits of punching babies. 




“I reject however any claims that I am some kind of baby hater,” said Jim through a spokesman this morning. “Just because I go around retweeting videos online of babies being punched while adding the caption ‘lol, owned’ doesn’t mean I endorse such content, even if I then save it to my ‘sweet baby punching videos’ folder on my computer to rewatch later.”
The senator also denied that there was no debate to be had on the topic, and that he was simply using the idea of creating debate as an excuse for acting reprehensably without having to own up to the consequences of what legitimising baby punching could lead to. “The fact is that we have a real problem in this country that nobody wants to talk about. You know what every single terrorist in this country has is common? That’s right, they were all once babies. And I’m not going to stand idly by and let our country become over-run by these babies and their twisted ideologies. I mean, if they really want to live here the least they could do is try and learn the language!”

Lyle Shelton enjoys first weekend away after hooking up with Cory Bernardi ,"  




Fresh from announcing he was eschewing the Australian Christian Lobby for the Australian Conservatives Party, Lyle Shelton says he “very much enjoyed” his first weekend away with the party’s tall, tanned founder, sporting a grin for much of the weekend.
The couple did a series media events over the weekend, travelling throughout regional Queensland together.
Cory looked downright dashing with an open-neck white shirt with black jacket and suit pants. Lyle, too, attempted a casual-yet-formal look, but his open neck shirt was ill-matched with the brown jacket and jeans.
Insiders say Lyle is concerned that his first impression wasn’t up to Cory’s standards, and that unless he invests in some new suits, Cory may lose interest in the energetic campaigner.
Lyle, 48, is brings a paler and perhaps less chiselled yet cheerful face to the Conservative party.
“Lyle is definitely batting above his average,” said one observer. “From a purely looks perspective, Lyle is at best a 5 or 6, while Cory Bernardi is a solid 7 or 8.”
Meanwhile, Lyle is enjoying the hook-up while he can. Lyle said he was looking forward to plenty more weekends away with the handsome party leader in the coming months. “It’s very, very exciting.

Government reassures public that terrorists will be required to fill out proper forms before buying Aussie weapons ,"Christopher Pyne has countered accusations that Australian-built weapons would fall into the wrong hands, by insisting that sales would only be made to buyers with the correct permits. 




But national security experts that such weapons often fall into enemy hands. The United States armed the Taliban in Afghanistan during the early 1980s, only for those weapons to be turned against US-forces in the aftermath of 9/11.
But Christopher Pyne said the mistake the US made was that they didn’t insist the Taliban sign the appropriate paperwork. “If the US had just insisted that the Taliban apply for a proper permit, then they wouldn’t be in this problem. They wouldn’t be allowed to break the terms of that permit. Otherwise they’d be subject to a $55 fine, and the loss of three points off their arms licence.”
Mr Pyne said the permits will be administered by local councils, and will be similar to applying for a parking permit. Households will be limited to purchasing a maximum of five surface-to-air missiles per year.",NaN,"February 1, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/christopher-pyne.jpg,Fake
Shorten calls for Federal ICAC while furiously shredding papers from his briefcase ,"Opposition leader Bill Shorten has today announced that he will be making it a priority to see a federal anti-corruption body created in 2018. Speaking to the press in his office at parliament, Mr Shorten claimed a crackdown on corruption in Canberra was “long overdue”, while furiously shredding documents from his briefcase. 




“We need to restore the public’s trust in politicians, there have been too many scandals over last year,” continued Shorten, as interns behind him poured petrol over piles of official government documents. “From members of certain parties accepting bribes from Chinese donors to pay for hotel bills, to certain opposition leaders being hauled before the Senate over suspicious financial transactions during his time as a union leader, there is just far too much corruption undermining our trust with the public.”
“Now if you’ll excuse me,” said Shorten, donning a bullet proof vest, “I have to go inform my colleagues of this new policy.”
However, not everyone is in favour of the idea of a federal ICAC, with many definately-not-corrupt politicians speaking out against the idea through the goodness of their hearts. “Personally I have never once heard of a politician acting in his own interest instead of the public’s,” said Deputy Prime Minster Barnaby Joyce this afternoon “and as such I can’t see a single reason to implement an anti-corruption body. And I’m not just saying that because my rich donors are telling me to.”",NaN,"January 30, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shorten_1-1024x577.jpg,Fake
Triple J Hosts Bravely Declare Next Song a “Real Banger” ,"Triple J hosts have today defied expectations of audiences nationwide, after bravely declaring that the next song on their playlist was a “real banger”. Telling listeners that they have a “real treat” coming up for them in a few songs time, Triple J hosts Lem and Kyra then went on to explain “but first we’ve got a real banger here for you by none other than Kendrick Lamar, followed by an absolute banger by Sujan Stevens.” 




Asked whether it had become official Triple J policy to describe any and all songs as bangers, no matter how ill-fitting the term may be, 72 year old station head Robert “Beezy” Bensworth said that it was just a natural development and hasn’t been forced from above by management. “It all natural baby!” he shouted, before ollieing away on his skateboard and breaking both hips.
However, not all Triple J hosts are on board with the term, with Hack presenter Tom Tilley refusing to describe even a single one of his current affairs stories as “bangers”.

“Bitcoin is obviously a bubble” claims Boomer with 5 investment properties ,"Local Baby Boomer and self-taught property investor Barry “The Landlord” Roberts has today told his five disinterested children that they should avoid putting their money into Bitcoin, warning them that the crypto currency shows clears signs of a bubble. “These people buying up all these Bitcoins are idiots,” insisted Barry, “anyone with eyes can see that with prices escalating so fast that it must be in a bubble. No, if you’re smart and savy investors, you kids should all invest your life savings into Sydney property – like I did.” 




“Unlike Bitcoin,” continued Barry “which has obviously been gaining value so rapidly that it’s simply unsustainable in the long term, property is something which people have endless reserves of cash to pay for, which is what makes it a great investment.

Global warming sole cause of summer heat says moron ,"IN the midst of another sweltering day, one passionate Australian has vented his fury at the inaction of corporations and government that has intensified global warming and resulted in ‘unbearable’ mid-January temperatures in the mid-to-high 30s. 




“I can’t believe the government isn’t holding the big polluters accountable and doing something about this,” moaned Reggie, 25. “It’s so hot that I’ve had to leave my air conditioner on 16 degrees for the past 48 hours and just stay on my couch watching Netflix. Global warming needs to be stopped!”
“It’s so hot that I can’t even walk to the corner store to buy an ice block. Normally I drive there anyway because there’s a hill, but it would still be nice to have the option.”
“I almost believed that weather like this was normal for the middle of summer, until I got on social media and saw that everyone I knew was talking about it and complaining too. Surely if this heat was normal we’d have something more interesting to talk about, right? It’s global warming!”
“I’m starting to think this so-called ‘summer’  is actually a construct created by the illuminati to justify periodic increases in temperature and leave us in the dark. Bloody Liberals,” he wrote on the Facebook page ‘Stop Global Warming’.
Reggie has admitted that until someone else takes action to fight global warming, he’ll be leaving his air conditioner on and driving everywhere – at least until he can re-apply his complaints to the winter cold.",NaN,"January 19, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sweat-1024x683.jpg,Fake
Health insurers justify $150 increase – “We only made a billion dollars last year” ,"Private health insurers have today hit back at criticism against a 4% increase in premiums jointly agreed to by the health industry and the government, stating that it was crucially important that Australians pay more for their health insurance, as the struggling insurance industry had only scraped together a measly $1.3 billion profit last year. 




However, despite the clear need for an increase, many Australian families have reacted with hostility to the news, stating that the cost increase would force them to consider dropping their health cover altogether, a reaction that the government has painted as “hysterical”. “Let’s not lose our heads here,” said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull this morning. “Why it’s only $200. I’m sure the average family is capable of giving up one night’s bottle of wine in order to cover a year’s healthcare!”
The ministry of health has also backed the $200 price increases, stating they were necessary to ensure that healthcare remains affordable in Australia. “The system is working as intended” insisted health minister Greg Hunt this morning. “We pay the private insurers $6 billion in subsidies each year, the public then pays additional money out of their own pockets, then the insurers pocket a few billion dollars in profit before asking us for another price hike at the end of the year, which of course we will give them. It’s a good healthy system working as intended.”
The health insurers were also insistent that the increase in customer fees were a necessary evil that was desperately needed to keep their businesses afloat. “We’d love to be able to say to customers that their rates aren’t going up, what with the rising cost of living and stagnating wages, but the fact is we can’t afford to act like a charity.” said Bupa spokeswoman Elisa Cashgrab. “I mean between 2016 and 2017 our profits only went up a measly 18 percent. And while that might sound like a lot of money, you’ve got to remember there are a lot of costs involved with running an insurance scam, I mean business.”",NaN,"January 17, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Greg-Hunt-960x540.jpg,Fake
PricewaterhouseCoopers mistakenly tells Apple it must pay tax ,"Compounding a horror week for the global accountancy firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers accidentally told tech company Apple that it must pay tax, after delivering an envelope with the wrong tax advice to the world’s richest company. 




In an absurd stuff-up, accountants at the firm were preparing two tax returns. One was for a low-wage retail worker, Paul Hutchins, and one was for the global multinational conglomerate.
At the last minute the envelopes containing the returns were swapped, which meant that Apple received the tax advice for the low-wage worker. As a result, Apple mistakenly thought it was going to have to pay a third of its profits in income tax.
At the same time, the worker received the advice for Apple, advising him that no tax was payable.
“I knew something was wrong the moment I opened the enveloped,” Paul Hutchins told reporters. “No tax payable? Clearly that was meant for a multinational corporation, not someone who works at K-Mart.”
The accounting firm almost immediately realized the error but it took some time for the correct envelopes to be exchanged, and in the process Apple almost paid tax.
Luckily, the error was caught just in time, and Apple were saved from the embarrassment of paying tax on its income. Mr Hutchins is now facing penalties for late payment of his tax.",NaN,"January 17, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shutterstock_569993584.jpg,Fake
NBN says video apologising for slow speeds should be finished uploading by mid-2019 ,"The NBN announced this morning it had finally managed to load the speedtest.net website, which measures internet speeds, and discovered that its speed wasn’t quite as fast as they’d hoped. 




A spokesperson for the NBN said that they first suspected the NBN was too slow in early 2016, and immediately went to the speedtest.net website. “Now, two years later, we’ve managed to load that website, and boy, that speed is not nearly as fast as we’d been saying! Who knew? I mean, I wish someone had told us.”
The spokeswoman said the NBN were looking at going back to an ADSL connection until the speeds increase.
“Personally, I just thought it was because Bill Morrow had too many torrents downloading in his office,” admitted the spokesperson. The NBN CEO did not return emails seeking comment, although a spokesperson said the email probably just hadn’t downloaded yet.
The government has defended the $30 billion cost of the NBN as a “great social investment”.

Kangaroo on Harbour Bridge breaks speed record for object travelling in bus lane ,"Sydney authorities from the Roads and Maritime services say they were left in “disbelief” after calls started pouring into their office reporting that a Kangaroo had been sighted hopping down a bus lane on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Traffic controllers say they initially refused to believe the calls from shocked members of the publc, believing they were being pranked, given that “they’d never heard reports of anything actually moving in a bus lane before.” 




“I’ve gotta say, I was quite surprised” said bus driver Vince Busdriver, who witnessed the incident. “I thought someone was definitely going to get killed, with the Kangaroo travelling at those breakneck 5 kilometre an hour speeds. In fact I had to slow down just to make sure I didn’t cause an accident. The passengers insisted it wasn’t possible for us to go slower than 0km/h but it turns out the bus has a ‘reverse’ gear.”
Representatives for the RMS say they have now brought the situation under control, removing the Kangaroo from the bridge, but not before issuing it with a fine and a court date for it’s lack of an e-toll tag. Asked whether they thought fining an animal with the IQ of a cinderblock for toll evasion was the right approach, RMS staff were unrepentant. “We can’t go making exceptions,” said Roads Minister Melinda Pavey, “or before we know it every man and his dog will be trying to get across the bridge toll free by just hopping on the back of a Roo.”
“And an Australia where the public ride Kangaroos across the Harbour Bridge is the kind of sick twisted fiction that should stay limited to advertising we export to trick Americans into holidaying in this shithouse country.”

Disneyland launches new apocalyptic thrill ride ,"Disneyland is undergoing a rapid rebrand with the launch of their new house of horrors thrill ride featuring a President Donald J Trump. 




The apocalyptic vision is a twist on their famous Hall of Presidents, which has life size robotic recreations of the American presidents, but until now was quite boring.
“We are committed to giving visitors of Disneyland an emotional rollercoaster,” said spokesman at the launch today.
The new ride released by the Disney corporation this week takes visitors on a journey to a fictional alternative reality where the American public elected a modern Hitler re-incarnate into the White House. Though there were concerns the public might find such an idea too unrealistic, reports from the first attendees of the “Hall of Presidents” ride have described the spectacle as “terrifying” and “truly immersive” with attendees describing the experience as being like as if they were actually there living the nightmare.
The robotic “President Trump” has been programmed to move haphazardly and without signs of intelligence or a soul. Its skin is pasty and clearly not human, a terrifying and accurate portrayal of Trump which the creators say took a while to perfect.
The Trump speaks words uttered by a president during an inauguration.
“Hearing those words from Donald Trump’s mouth is enough to make your skin crawl. We are really thrilled to give people the opportunity to experience this terrifying vision of what could ave been.”
The other robotic figures of past presidents are depicted as rolling in their graves. A lifelife version of President Hilary Clinton was reportedly scrapped due to it being too unrealistic, with attendees describing it as “far too animated and lifelike to be believable.”",NaN,"December 20, 2017",NaN,NaN,https://chaser.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/trump_disney-1024x575.jpg,Fake

Abbott spotted stealing pens from Governor’s House in last ditch bid to stop gay marriage ,"Former Prime Minister and prominent ‘No’ vote campaigner Tony Abbott has today graciously accepted defeat following the national plebiscite into same-sex marriage, by breaking into Government house and holding the governor’s official seal ransom until the Governor promises not to legalise any gay weddings. 




Rolling around on the floor with tears rolling down his face, the former Rhodes scholar was seen screaming “It’s not fair” at the Governor General, before accusing him of “ruining everything” and locking himself in the bathroom.
“It’s God’s will that I ignore the wishes of my electorate who voted me into parliament!” sobbed Mr Abbott through the door as Prime Minister Turnbull tried to coax him out with the promise of communion biscuits and a keg of wine. “And I don’t want to be forced to wear a dress and marry a man!”
Eventually leaving the bathroom after Deputy Leader Julie Bishop threatened to take away his travel allowance, Mr Abbott apologised for the tantrum, blaming his sister for the outburst. “She just really knows how to push my buttons, she’s always bullying me, you know?” said Abbott. “In fact the only reason I even opposed same-sex marriage is to get back at her for the time she smashed my lego castle, when I’d just got the scene of me knighting the Queen just right.”
Mr Abbott was then carried out of the Governor’s mansion by his political love-parents John Howard and Bronywn Bishop, who promised him a nice raw onion to chew on if he behaved on the way home.

Jubilation as parliament fails to deal with people being torn to pieces by crocodiles every three months in north Queensland ,"Australia has today celebrated only being six years behind Alabama when it comes to equality. Coming together as one to vote in favour of equal rights after only delaying the inevitable and largely uncontroversial right for same-sex couples to marry only thirteen years after it could and should have happened, politicians today patted themselves on the back for a job well done, for six hours before finally getting around to actually passing the bill. 




However, the parliament has already come under heavy fire from conservative critics, who have complained that the bill contained none of the amendments requiring schoolboys to wear dresses as they had demanded during the plebiscite.
Conservative cake makers were also witnessed breaking into tears across the country at the news that they would now be forced to make considerably more money for doing the exact thing that they do every day.
The Catholic Church has also spoken out following the ruling, announcing that they will not be conducting any same-sex marriages in their churches, despite the law change. “Turns out we’re not legally required to conduct marriages that don’t align with our faith, even though the law’s changed. We probably should have looked that up before funding a multi-million dollar campaign claiming otherwise.” said a representative. “However, we are still very concerned for the safety of children as a result of this change of law, and trust us, we know a thing or two about how harmful child abuse can be to a sacred institution.”
It is expected that the first same-sex marriages will occur as soon as this afternoon in the parliamentary courtyard, followed shortly after by canapes and a spectacular fire and brimstone display.
Standing in the parliamentary gallery, gay couple Greg and Robert Lastname were brought to tears by the ruling. “It’s just such an emotional time for us,” said Greg to reporters following the vote. “We’ve already gone through all the pain and cost of holding a commitment ceremony just last year, now we have to fork out for a wedding as well?

Banks appoint Turnbull as lead counsel for Royal Commission: “It’s good to have one of our own” ,"The Big Four banks have rushed to appoint a lead counsel to represent them in the Royal Commission into the Banking and Finance Industry announced earlier today.

North Korea Lacing Love Letters to President Trump with Homosexual Chemtrail-Laced Inks,"
Posted By: Reverend Clyde H. Higgins
September 30, 2018


The gay community has shared its latest mind-warping chemtrail technology on the international black market and the aftermath of it has reached the highest echelons of politics.
New reports reveal that gays have developed a powerful new ink that when touched or inhaled, immediately puts the body in a post-coital ‘lover’s trance’ in which the brain is extremely pliable to written suggestion.
The report gained popularity today after moral media outlets struggled to explain why President Trump announced that he and Kim Jong Un are ‘in love’ after description of a breathy, meaty, intimate exchange and a series of love letters from North Korea.  The crowd nervously laughed as Trump spoke about how the chemtrails affected him, all caught on video.

Scientists with the Christian Defender League of Texas speculate that gays are milking the ink sacs of squids, then taking the milky ink and mixing it with spent 8-ball soaked sweats of late night homosexuality obtained from various night clubs, using some sort of advanced electrophoresis technique to complete the product.
Prayer warriors are being told to unleash an extra prayer today so that the effects of the chemical ink on the president can be undone.

"Now That President Trump Has Finally Declared War On the LBQT Community, What Minorities Should He Target Next?","
Posted By: Marion Uncmeier
July 26, 2017

Today President Trump finally unveiled his true heart toward the LGBT community by unleashing the’ SN2 mechanism, the classic backside attack, by banning members of the LGBT community from serving in the military.  While some conservative gays were absolutely shocked that Trump would do such things, it should have been patently obvious with his administration picks that President Trump’s idea of ‘Make America Great Again’ hearkens back to his childhood time of the late 1940s to 1950s, where the word gay meant ‘happy’, Jim Crow was the law of the South and women were all June Cleavers standing attention and ready to serve their Ward Cleavers.
The backlash against President Trump’s decision to remove a sector of the LBGT community from the military service has been predictable.  George Takei is on Facebook making smarmy commentary, disgruntled Congressional members from liberal-voting districts are making enough noise so that their constituents will vote for them again and Republicans saw Trump follow-up his military announcement with a Tweet stating, “WE WORSHIP GOD – in America.”
Hook, line, sinker.  The art of the deal.  Liberals are sulking and fussing like angry children, conservatives are eating up Trump’s demagoguery.  The official talking point is that President Trump  needed to save the GOP budget and key votes hinged on the ‘drastic’ amount of money having to be spent on those Trump kicked out of service.  The truth of the matter is that the measure being debated was .00003% of the overall military budget, but cuts between 3 – 15,000 service members out of duty effective immediately.
Now that President Trump is rolling back rights, it is time to think if there are other minorities who are just burdening the military and beyond.  It is estimated that the army must spend more then $500,000,000,000 per year in programs aimed at diversity recruitment and training.   A dramatic increase of budget would be achieved if the army turned back to only housing Caucasian males.  Women could stay in America growing victory gardens while other minorities could just move back to their neighborhoods, as we know, segregation and separate and not equal schools, housing and roads would save America trillions.
If Trump were to push for such things, the only thing he’d have to worry about are snarky retweets and Facebook social warriors ballyhooing him for a few days, but then just accepting the new reality and moving on.  MAGA!

"Poor People Don’t Need Blue Cross Insurance, They Only Need True Cross Insurance","

As the Senate prepares to repeal ObamaCare and insure 22 million people don’t ‘run up the bill’ trying to take care of their ‘ailments’, America is in a unique position to remind poor people of the nation of one simple fact:  you don’t need Medicaid, Medicare or even Blue Cross, you only need True Cross.
The science is simple:  prayer is a more powerful and affordable health insurance for poor people than any commercial insurance plans in the market place.
It seems almost criminal that poor people would submit themselves to monthly premiums and copays that they cannot afford, when all they have to do is go find a good church and let the members freely administer prayer to them.
Liberals will claim that there is no scientific documentation that prayers cannot heal people, but that is simply not true.  The science is pure and true, this is why the Trump Administration and Congress are rushing to get 22 million people off of that expensive Obamacare by passing the American Health Care Act.
And instead of calling the new insurance TrumpCare, it is more appropriate to call it True Cross because that will be the source of all healing the poors will be receiving once the wonderful new health insurance — prayer — is rolled out to them.",NaN,"June 30, 2017",NaN,NaN,http://christwire.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/5bf941524ffaf254b9169a0bc4b9c03d-forearm-muscles-praying-hands-1.jpg,Fake
Confirmed:  Gays Are Using Snapchat’s New Snap Map Location Feature To Hunt Down Straight Men And Turn Them Gay,"
Posted By: Marion Uncmeier
June 30, 2017

Moles within the gays community confirm that gays have used their technological prowess to exploit Snapchat’s new Snap Map feature to hunt down straight men and groom them into homosexuality.
Earlier in the week, reports arose nationwide that straight fathers taking innocent morning strolls or late night jaunts to the supermarket were making up missing, only to be found hours later exhausted and with spent sweat, the ‘look of homosexuality’ raging within their eyes.
Scientists from the CDC found that their symptoms were consistent with homosexuality, though their families insisted that they previously showed no sort of interest in the lifestyle. Researchers found that the only thing all the men had in common is their smartphones contained the Snapchat app.
The Christian Defense League of Texas reports that as of Friday, over 6,586 have had their location ‘snap mapped’ by gays on the prowl, some traveling as far as California or New York to the Bible Belt to “get a taste of American beefcake.”
Throughout the past decade, gays have been able to apply their mastery of computers to reconfigure many applications to secretly serve their agenda. To date, the most nefarious and well-known plot of the gay community took place when they were able to groom men on Christian Mingle into thinking they were building a relationship with a woman, when it was already too late with emotional involvement that they found they were attracted to a gay man playing ‘catfish’ on the other end of the internet connection.
Researchers with CDL of Texas warn the Christian Mingle disaster is nowhere near the scope as the Snapchat tool, which could potentially leave millions of unsuspecting straight men prone and vulnerable to getting raunchy photos of toned backsides and seductive lips, getting all hot and heavy by the random images entering their phone, only to find out that it was images of a gay men hiding in the bushes or behind some shopping carts all along.
Coastal gays are turning their eyes to the mainland to hunt down ‘straight American beefcake’ via Snapchat’s new Snap Map location feature.
Gays are randomly browsing Bitmojis to find avatars that look like good, wholesome Christian fathers who are in a heterosexual relationship. They are traveling as far as New York, California and even France once they find ‘the right guy’. They are then networking with each other, cornering these vulnerable straight men as they continue on their day, not knowing they are prey to a seductive predator who will shamelessly snapchat pictures of his glistening abs, perfectly chisled buttocks and lean, toned thighs to make a bored straight dad think he’s being hit on by a hot co-ed, when in reality it is a group of gays closing in to get an inevitable taste of foreign DNA.
The Christian Defense League of Texas is warning straight men to turn off the location feature on their phones and to use the buddy system, checking in with a friend or colleague every hour or so in case they are the target of a gay sting.

June 27, 2017

Liberals are up in arms now that Congress is poised to pass the American Health Care Act. Just because 22 million people will be without access to a primary care doctor and prescriptions, liberal elites are pretending like all hope is loss.
Scientific studies reveal the power of Christian prayer is just as effective as going to the doctor, especially for poor people.  Researchers found that a specific prayer technique called Proximal Intercessory Prayer unleashes a ‘divine healing’ upon the subject.
The best part of this medical treatment is that it is free.
Beyond curing standard ailments such as cough, astigmatism and various pre-existing medical conditions, prayer has been proven to cure more pervasive ailments such as homosexuality and marijuana addiction.
Scientists with the Christian Defense League of Texas recently released a study in which various high-profile clergy in Texas were called in to administer 20 units of intense prayer to a man who had succumbed to homosexuality vis-a-vis homosexual chemtrail inhalation.
Soon after the full dosage of prayer was administered, the man’s body started to release a rainbow-colored smoke cloud consistent with that of homosexual chemtrails.  Prayer was shown on film curing a man of his recently acquired homosexuality.
New images from the CDL of Texas show the moment a team of prayer technicians administered prayer in a high enough dosage to completely reverse a newly acquired case of homosexuality. The victim in the picture was able to return to his family and resume his duties as a heterosexual husband and good father.
The CDC further repudiates the success of prayer in keeping young adults from relapsing into a marijuana addiction. By doing such, this also decreases teenage pregnancy rates, obesity and poorness.",NaN,"June 27, 2017",NaN,NaN,http://christwire.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/5bf941524ffaf254b9169a0bc4b9c03d-forearm-muscles-praying-hands.jpg,Fake
Police Find Largest Hidden Trove Of Nazi Artifacts in Argentina,"

Police report that a house in Beccar, just north of Buenos Aires, Argentina, contains what appears to be the largest collection of Nazi-Germany artifacts which seem to be authentic and likely belonged to a high level officer.  
In total, there are 75 pieces in the collection, all emblazoned with details typical of 1940s-era Germany under the rule of Adolf Hitler.  

“Our first investigations indicate that these are original pieces,” Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich told The Associated Press on Monday, saying that some pieces were accompanied by old photographs. “This is a way to commercialize them, showing that they were used by the horror, by the Fuhrer. There are photos of him with the objects.”
Among the disturbing items were toys that Bullrich said would have been used to indoctrinate children, a large statue of the Nazi Eagle above a swastika, a Nazi hourglass and a box of harmonicas.
Police say one of the most-compelling pieces of evidence of the historical importance of the find is a photo negative of Hitler holding a magnifying glass similar to those found in the boxes.

Fans of hit television show The Walking Dead are in mourning today after learning the victim of Neegan and his bat Lucille is none other than series favorite Glenn.
Insiders to the show reveal that originally, producers planned for only Abraham Ford to die in the season finale.  But they allegedly received an ominous phone call directly from the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, demanding that Glenn be killed off as well and that she would be by the set to tell them who would be dying off.

Hillary Clinton is the harbinger of doom for Glenn on the Walking Dead, staring straight at him as she lets producers know who she wants wiped off the show so that she may destroy the morale of Trump fans who had a guilty pleasure in watching Glenn survive in The Walking Dead.
Moles within the Clinton campaign confirm that Hillary ordered the deaths of both Abraham Ford and Glenn, all because a new poll showed that for Donald Trump supporters, Abraham and Glenn were the two favorite characters.
Hillary allegedly wanted to send a ‘clear message’ to Donald Trump and his fans, that no matter where they try to relax and take pleasure, she can use her control of media to ruin their day.  The Walking Dead producers could not risk defying Hillary and having her win the presidency, then using the powerful FCC to make running the show a nightmare.

Sources are reporting a record number of couples are filing for divorce this summer and blaming the gay-power app Pokemon Go!
“What many consumers fail to realize is that Pokemon was created in Japan as a dating game for homosexuals.  Pokemon literally means ‘Pocket Monster’ in Japanese, with pocket monster being euphemism for a male’s reproductive organ,” reports the St. Olaf Conservative Tribune.
Pokemon Go! stands for ‘Pokemon Gay Overload!’ or fully translated, “Pocket Monster, Gay Overload!”.  This next generation of the Pokemon series uses suggestive sprites and hides them in locations that are sure to cause homosexual encounters.

One hospital employee reported that Pokemon continually appeared next to vials of morphine, trying to tempt exhausted doctors and nurses to sneak into the vicinity with their phones, take a hit as they tried to capture the ‘pocket monster’ and then let all sorts of homosexuality break loose.
A heat-map reveals that Pokemon are frequently showing up in gay bars, late-night fraternity houses, sweaty gyms, whole food stores and an overabundance in SoHo.  These are all places that are no stranger to homosexuality, so it should be apparent that the game is designed to lure people into a new lifestyle.",NaN,"July 16, 2016",NaN,NaN,,Fake

June 16, 2016

In a recent Senate session, Ted Cruz suggested that women be required to register for the military draft starting January, 18, 2017. This would be a radical change in the American military history for the books. The ages for the requirement would be from 18-25, just like with men who are required to register for military draft. This system has been used since World War II and Vietnam.

Clinton And Sanders Meet To Plan To Take On Trump,"
Posted By: Cadence Appleton
June 15, 2016

After winning the Primaries, Hillary Clinton met up with Bernie Sanders  for almost two full hours at a local restaurant to come up with a plan to take on Donald Trump. The two have come together to take on this mad man and defeat him before he destroys the country and lead us to ruin.
When interviewed by Yahoo News and politics Hillary stated,
“We’ve talked about the “dangerous threat Donald Trump poses to the nation.” The Clinton camp said the pair discussed “uniting the party,” while Sanders’ statement omitted that phrasing. The candidates agreed to work to develop a “progressive agenda” for the party platform in July, Sanders’ statement said, while the Clinton campaign called it their “shared agenda.”
Hillary and Bernie talked about what the plan would entail and how it would be executed. Hillary has every chance to taking out Donald Trump and we have to save the country from this mad man who wants to build walls in the American Southwest, ban all immigrants from coming in the country, and gather all the riches in the great U.S.A for himself!

Here’s the box art for the new Zelda game, Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, we’re currently going crazy about. It features artwork we saw a while back, with Link aiming his bow. Now, don’t get me wrong, the art is pretty, but considering how amazing the game’s world looks, it seems a shame not to see a beautiful landscape on the cover.
 
As you can see from the box art, Amiibo support is indeed confirmed for the game. The amiibo characters are not limited to just the hero of this game but also the heroes from Twilight Princess, Ocarina of Time, and Skyward Sword. The villain Ganon from Ocarina of Time has been confirmed to make an appearance in the game as a boss.

Lebron James Caught Crying  to Mama Ref After He Fails To Get Varejão Kicked Out of The Game,"

It’s no surprise that Lebron James is a decent basketball player and shady human being with lots of money. We all know he’s not the smartest of players in the NBA, but when he has to result to cheating and poor sportsmanship, that’s when the referees need to pay attention and call the right calls.
Lebron’s team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Steph Curry’s team, the Golden State Warriors, went head to head tonight to win the hearts of the people and play for glory and a fat commercial deal by Nike, Brita, and State Farm Insurance Company. As the game went on, the Golden State Warriors lost two players; Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut to injuries and vocal B.S.
 
Lebron tried his absolute hardest to eject Varejão out of the game as well and tried so very hard to dwindle the Warriors down to their bare bones bench players, but when the referees finally did their job and called the right call, who should go crying to the refs but Lebron James.
He was literally crying to them like he would to his mother. Things didn’t go his way so he cried and cried until the little side court boys had to wipe up his tears from the floor so he couldn’t try to injure any of the other Golden State Warriors.
Needless to say Lebron had paid off the referees this game and the Oklahoma City Thunder won unanimously. There will be another game on another day this week at 8:00PM.",NaN,"June 13, 2016",NaN,NaN,http://christwire.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/james_display_image.jpg,Fake

"Tragedy at Club Pulse in Orlando Reminder That We Are All Human, Deserve Better Than This","
Posted By: Johnny Rocca
June 12, 2016

It is sad that at times it takes a great act of horror to bring us together to remember one thing:  we are all humans and at the end of the day, deserve happiness.

Not to dig too deep into politics so soon after such travesty, only weeks ago the political landscape of America was on fire as citizens argued over transgender rights in public restrooms.  Some argued they would not feel safe with a person of switched gender in the bathroom with their family, others brought out the point that being gay, straight, transgender or gender neutral does not make one a criminal.
But now, in the face of a shooting where at least 50 people have lost their life, there is a stinging reality:  we have bigger fish to fry in America.  In a world where weaponry and communication grows more sophisticated, we have a major issue going on.  One man can enter a place of recreation and cause chaos enough that a major US city is in a state of emergency and a community is left recovering after the deadliest civilian gun attack in United States history.
We have watched other stories of sweet people in a church being gunned down, a movie theater, a school and now a club that is popular for the LGBT community.
There is a new presidential election coming up and new legislative elections too.  It is time we stop focusing on issues that, yes, we must come to a consensus on as a society.  People have every right to feel uncomfortable about a certain subject, rally, protest and vote accordingly.  But there comes a time where we need to check ourselves and ask what is absolutely destroying us.  And when we are looking at repeated shootings where Americans lay shot and dead, I think we have found an issue where we need to pull our heads out of our collective backsides and start thinking of solutions.
If one man with an AR-15 can do this, just let’s not think of a coordinated attack.  The chaos, fear and pandemonium could cripple US lifestyle for years.  It’s time to stop alienating people based on their beliefs which are legal by law, and instead focus on the things that are destroying the security and freedom to enjoy life that make us American.",NaN,"June 12, 2016",NaN,NaN,http://christwire.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/13418734_10154093275230470_8936621504991304146_n.jpg,Fake
"Russian President Vladimir Putin Beats Living Crap Out of Great White Shark, Dares Barack Obama to ‘Bring it On’","

September 18, 2013


Moscow, Russia (ChristWire) – The Kremlin released a photograph of Vladimir Putin today, moments after he dove into an ocean and “beat the ever loving sh#$ out of a great white shark”, according to bystander Sergei Glasnost.    Insiders say that Putin was steaming upset that Obama did not have the spine to bomb Syria and go to war with Russia.
“The man is giant American pussy,” Russian media quotes Vladimir Putin saying of Barack Obama.  “He is weak and cannot even fight minnow.  I killed a shark.”
Shocked officials claim Putin dove into warm waters off the Syria coast late yesterday afternoon, audibly cussing as he couldn’t find any sharks to make his point.  Frazzled and growing impatient, Vladimir Putin allegedly pulled a pocket knife from his swimming shorts and stabbed himself right in the heart so the ‘blood would be fresh’.
With blood pouring from his body, Putin waited for a shark to approach him before ‘repeatedly crushing the shark in the head’.  Several bystanders state they heard the shark physically cry and several young children closed their eyes tightly and held their mothers.  Even several generals on scene begged for Putin to have mercy on the shark, which he dragged to shore by its ventral fin.

"Selkirk Rex Poodle Cats, The New Dangerous Breed To Infiltrate The Internet","
Posted By: Adam Nelson
June 23, 2013

Cats are the harbingers of a civilization’s demise.  Just look unto Egypt of old, a land where proud pharaohs saw the construction of history’s great pyramids and oversaw vast kingdoms of wealth, right in the heart of an arid desert.  The achievements of ancient Egypt were not enough to overcome one great beast:  the cat.
Cats are duplicitous by their very nature and woo you with cute purrs, front paw massages and little antenna ears that flicker about when you tease at them. But do not be fooled:  these creatures are here for the express purpose of dumbing down our civilization, so it will fall faster than Lohan’s skivvies at Mardi Gras.
With that image in your mind, let us look at this new breed of pussy cats.

These poodle cats are officially called Selkirk Rex, which looks and sounds enough like Skrillex for me to cringe when I think about this cat meowing while in heat.  You’ll notice that the fur is fluffy and coarse, like a French Poodle.  This cat is groomed by the breed’s standards and with its beefy 80s styled hair, it is ready for memes, Reddit posts and to make you waste time looking at them all and then sharing it to your Facebook.
I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I think the Chinese superscientists are behind this cat.  They know Americans tend to have an addiction to the internet and for some reason, many people in this country cannot get enough cat humor in their lives.  They talk about the little vermin nonstop and it is probably from toxoplasmosis brainwashing, the very same thing Skrillex and other ravers use to get people addicted to their horrible music.
 

You will note that all these Selkirk Rex cats are absolutely horrible with their teased, over processed 80s hair. I cannot help but thinking of Rod Stewart when looking at the poodle cat to the right. Reports indicate the breed first appeared in the US in 1987, inside a shipping crate from China.
When the customs officials tried to capture the cat, it hissed and ran away into the Seattle area. A couple in the area allegedly found the cat and named her Miss DePesto, and not much more was said of the incident. Now that the filial generations are afoot however, we can see this was a very slyly calculated ploy by the Chinese to have a little four-legged rogue infiltrate America during the internet’s burgeoning age, and now that we have nearly mastered global communication they make a grand appearance?
I think the coincidence is all too much.",NaN,"June 23, 2013",NaN,NaN,http://christwire.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/article-2346408-1A73B2CB000005DC-942_634x315.jpg,Fake
AMA Rules Obesity Is A Disease,"
Posted By: Adam Nelson
June 19, 2013


America is the most obese country on Earth. From people using their rotund bellies as makeshift tables to Paula Deen adding a smidgin’ of pure lard by the short ton to her cakes, America has grown accustom to lifestyle and habits that lead to body fat accumulation.
Today the American Medical Association (AMA) ruled that obesity will be classified as a medical disease. As such, any person who is ruled medically obese is now a diseased individual. While the classification can do wonders in requiring health insurances to support medicinal, lifestyle/therapy and medical procedures ordered by doctors that can help ‘alleviate’ the disease, America may soon have a very real burden on its hands.
Perhaps the AMA missed an important consideration:  nearly fifty percent of Americans are obese, with an alarmingly growing trend of those being morbidly obese.  In 2014, the Affordable Care Act will expand government issued insurance to all those who do not have insurance.  People who are obese, soon to be the majority of Americans, can claim disability for their obese disease and will have rights to full medical treatment for their disease.
Such a qualification will also allow people to claim full disability benefits, including food, house subsidy and a monthly stipend.  Can America risk a good portion of the population taking advantage of their obesity?

The nation’s leading physicians did not come upon the decision to classify obesity as a disease with great ease. Some analysts have seen the move by physicians as a move to squeeze more money out of insurance companies. In all actuality, the issue was heavy debated, with physicians being heavily divided on whether their classification would do more to help affected patients get useful treatment, or would rather cause a stigmatized, victim mentality that has obese people giving up and giving in to an assisted system for their ailment.
In the end, despite numerous warnings, America’s medical association decided to extend the diagnosis of Obesity Disease to over one third of America’s adult population and nearly 20% of children in the nation.
“Recognizing obesity as a disease will help change the way the medical community tackles this complex issue that affects approximately 1 in 3 Americans,” said Dr. Patrice Harris, a ranking AMA board member.
In an ideal world, the ruling will mandate primary care physicians seek any and all treatment options for patients presenting with obesity. All employers will have to recognize those who claim obesity as a disease and accommodate their needs.
Procedures such as liposuction, weight-loss regimens and gastric bypass may become more commonplace, as a person’s primary care doctor may rule these procedures necessary in alleviation of obesity, which is deadly and increases risk of stroke, heart disease and diabetes.   Over the next 20 years, these obese-related diseases are projected to cost the nation’s medical bill over $550 billion.
Lifestyle Change: America’s trend of massive roadways, sedentary lifestyle and fat heavy/carb heavy/sugar heavy over-portioned diets helped lead to the current crisis of obesity.
Dr. Rexford Ahima of  the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism weighs in on the subject:  “This will force primary care physicians to address it, even if we don’t have a cure for it.”
While the tongue-in-cheek cure may be ‘stop eating so much’ or ‘stop giving your kids McDonald’s for dinner’, it is important to realize not all obesity is caused simply by overeating as a lifestyle choice.  Even in conditions such as diabetes with genetics as a causal factor, the body literally goes into a vicious craving and thirst cycle.
Considering the rate of obesity in America has been on a strong climb, perhaps officially requiring physicians to address the issue can help curb the trend.  But until America as a whole undergoes major lifestyle changes and promotes healthy lifestyle, especially in the price of healthy foods versus junk foods, we may be on an inescapable path of literally eating our culture to its death.

"Scooby Doo, The First Atheist Brainwashing Cartoon Reviewed","
Posted By: Adam Nelson
June 16, 2013

Scooby Dooby Doo is an atheist propaganda cartoon that reached its zenith during the turbulent, drug-fueled 1960s. The show featured a talking dog, a marijuana addicted hippie and three ‘free love’ college students who frequently engaged in off-screen coitus, without the bounds of marriage.
On the surface, the show purported to be a simple, fun buddy adventure archetype where four friends and their Great Dane dog engaged in riveting investigations. Parents felt comfortable letting their children watch a repurposed Sherlock Holmes, with teenaged college students being the protagonists.
But parents of the 1960s and even today could not understand the true agenda of this show: anti-theist brainwashing.
In each and every episode, the ‘villains’ of Scooby Doo turned out to be people of faith. They dress in costumes that suggest an afterlife or belief in a higher power, to only be defrocked and defrauded by the heroes of the shows, representations of very anti-theist values.
To get a full understanding of just how damaging and sneaky the show is with its agenda, a breakdown of the core characters and mores each episode espouse.
Scooby Doo and his buddy “Shaggy” caught hotboxing, right in the middle of an episode.
The name of the show’s titular character should send off alarm bells. A “Dooby Doo” is slang for marijuana. The main theme of the show was performed by the Doobie Brothers, a troupe of musicians who performed stoner music to set the mood for endless parties where participants did all sorts of illegal drugs and had drug-fueled pregnancy inducing sessions.
Scooby always has an insatiable appetite, one of the primary symptoms of marijuana addiction. The CDC reports that since the 1960s, America has seen an 84% increase in teenaged obese population. The obesity rates increase most dramatically in demographics that have access to a television where Scooby Doo airs in syndication.
Even beyond all the drug references in Scooby Doo’s existence, the dog also represents the dangerous concept of evolution.
Evolution is the belief that humans evolved from monkeys, who evolved from lungfish, who evolved from bacteria who all evolved from a ‘magical’ Big Bang that apparently started all life.
Scooby Doo climbed the evolutionary ladder in this show, regularly showing abilities beyond that of a dog: in the show, Scooby Doo showed impossible abilities for a dog, such as: talking, solving a mystery, eating sandwiches that contain onion, drinking chocolate milkshakes. The impossibilities go on and on, further destroying the facts of life for children. A dog cannot eat onions or chocolate, a dog cannot talk and a dog cannot independently solve crimes or roller-skate.
Freddie is a bisexual swinger who cannot get enough free love, no matter in what he’s sticking his sinning wick. Freddie is all about carnal pleasures and often invites Daphne, who wears an easy access dress, to go to exotic off-screen locations with himself so he can give her a shaggie. This teaches young men that is is okay to deflower your daughter, as long as they do it off-screen and away from your knowledge.

 
Freddie also wears an ascot, cementing his position in the homosexual sexual community as a Yankee Doodle Dandy. Dandies are men who oft dress in the highest New York fashions, attracting attention of struggling college students who will likely give them whatever they want, just for a few dollars for food or tuition money.
Freddie is obviously the rich, older homosexual of the group. Compared to everyone else, he is well-dressed and manicured, two distinct symptoms of being a Yankee Doodle Dandy. All of the characters have to give into his demands, even though his preference is likely shagging Shaggy.
The best way to characterize Shaggy is to think of internet website Reddit.com, then think about what their typical user looks like: unwashed/unshowered, on drugs, scraggly, sleep-deprived, perpetually hungry and in some form of college, where they could be an honor student but due to poor time management/turning tricks for their Dandy Daddy, they struggle to keep passing grades.

Shaggy happily eats a pile of sandwiches earned after marijuana-fueled buckling session where he let Freddie have his way with him.
4. Velma
Shy and quiet on the surface, dominating and luring underneath, Velma is the lusty library fetish character of the show.  While she always provides an excuse to get on her hands and knees with a famous utterance of ‘My glasses, I cannot see without my glasses,” we all know Velma’s cries of “Jinkies!” is some weird safety word that gets Shaggy, Freddy and Daphnie all excited.
With the all knowing glare and adjustment of her glasses, there is an 80% chance that this character is also promoting lesbianism.
5. Daphne
Finally, we get to the belladonna of sensuality herself:  Daphne.  Like all red-haired women, this Daphne is a dangerous vixen whose sole purpose it is to lure men into doing sin.  For the ascot-wearing Freddie, it must be awkward to take all of his passionate feelings toward the unclean shaggy, on a cleaner, more attainable Daphne who is always fresh, ready and willing.
Did we ever once see her turn down a ‘Well, you three go mess around over there while Daphne and I check out the hot sauna.” ?",NaN,"June 16, 2013",NaN,NaN,http://christwire.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/1005401_314168305384954_1914072812_n.png,Fake

Should Cats Be Arrested/Jailed For Huffing Catnip?,"
Posted By: Adam Nelson
February 27, 2013

As any cat owner can tell you, felines have an almost human quality and understanding of life.   It is not uncommon to find cats opening a cabinet to obtain their food, or after observing a human using the ‘potty’ for enough days, to take the task on for themselves.
Cats brains have evolved to understand basic human concepts and laws to maintain rules and order. Cats should be given one chance to know that drugs are bad and enjoying them more than once, equals a “forever” trip to the animal shelter.
Cats are smart, to the point that they can understand law and order.  Cats can maintain and abide by rules of the home.  It is simple to teach a cat that she cannot sit on the furniture or stomp your pillow to make a bad.  Gently beating the cat’s hind legs or head will disuade them from such mistakes.
The same is said of making a kitten learn to use a litter box.  A cat knows that a ‘mistake’ on the furniture or shoe in the closet can result in a loving wrath from her owner, so she will always use the litter box.  Cats can learn basic human concepts, but with that, comes an important question and realization:  should we enforce human law upon cats. Since they live in close proxy to us, the answer is yes.
Think about it like this:  if a dog bites a human, it will be tried and quite possibly put on death row.  A dog is judged by its ability to maintain law and order.  Some dogs do bite people and unfortunately, there is no chance for rehabilitation.
Once a biter, always a biter.
So we must apply the legal precedent to humanity’s other common, free-roaming companion:  the cat. Cats should face the same scrutiny if they decide to attack humans.  If you get attacked by your pet cat, let us say either by enduring and suffering a barrage of scratches or even worse, a bite, you should go the the Emergency Room and report an assault.  Animal control will come out to interview you, then go take the cat in for evaluation and questioning of morals.  Is it a dangerous animal? As a pet owner, you are oft blinded to the truth behind your cat.  What you may see as sweet and innocent, a skilled outsider will recognize as abusive, controlling and quite possibly deadly.
Cats are duplicitous and understand human psychology.  They are master manipulators who rule your life with Machiavellian contempt and prowess:  one minute they are letting you give them a belly rub, the next second, a lighting fast display of teeth and painful scars because you gave ‘one rub too many’.  The Prince teaches that to rule a kingdom, your subjects must fear your wrath and pine to give you affection.  A cat lives out the dream rule of The Prince.
Simply stated, having a mentally aware cat in the house is the same suffering, agonizing relationship a loving parent feels toward a drug-addicted son or daughter.  The parent showers love and tries to make things right, ignoring the bad habits of their little ward.  But the ward, ever so messed upin the mind, takes advantage of their genorous, agape love and strangles the life and energy from her owners.

Just like you must do a marijuana addicted youth, you must take the ‘tough love’ approach to truly put a cat in its place.  There is no rehabilitation for these types of behaviors: excessive drinking, blatant rudeness, promiscuity, addiction, lazy until video games/electronics turned on).
How many times have you sat down to your computer, to send some pressing emails or communiques with friends, when suddenly your lazy cat must jump up onto your keyboard or in front of your laptop’s screen, pawing about and then turning its backside to you, exposing its exremental flesh wound to your face.  That sort of sadistic, sick behavior is that of a drug user.  The cat wants to dominate your life and drag you into its perverted way of seeing life.
Even while reading this article, you cat owners out there have either shaken your head, laughed in understanding or are crying right now.  Some of you are enduring these dangerous, symptomatic cat behaviors as you read and share this work.  But let me give you something:  if you really need to know if you must call the authorities on your cat, do this one simple test.
Go to your local pet store and buy some catnip.  It is like marijuana unto a cat.  Spray some onto the cat’s face.  A few outcomes will occur:
1.  If the cat becomes visibly excited and runs around, greedly scooping the carpet and seeking more, you have a virgin addict.  The cat has a gene set that is primed for addiction and exploitation.  It is like a young schizophrenic, just too young to diagnose to the untrained eye, but its eventual dangerous habits will emerge.  It is best to just take this type of cat in to the vet or animal shelter, and let them unfortunately send the cat to forever paradise in seven days.
2.  The cat’s eyes may become wide and dilated, while the cat gets the ‘stoner glaze’.  You have all seen at least one drug-addicted bum hanging around a late-night 7-11, barrio, Cal-State Fullerton campus or some such.   If your cat gets the glaze, it means its body is so used to drugs, it has no problem with a direct puff of kitty marijuana right into its face.  Sorry, but the cat needs to be put down.
3.  Violence.  Some cats will hiss at you and try to scratch you, then run off and peak to plot a worse attack.  If your cat does this, immediately run!  You have a violent biter on your hands!  Immediately close the door and pull it tight (cats can open closed doors).  Run behind another closed door that you can put an object in front of and call animal control, tell them to bring a team, maybe some tranquilizer darts (if you have an exotic species of cat) and be prepared to say goodbye.  Cats are known to bite and maul, sometimes giving out Bubonic bites.  There was another story of a person who did this test and ignored that cats violent behavior, who then came to regret their foolishness because several months later, the cat suffocated their baby ‘because it smelled milk on the breath’.
The owner took the cat in to be put down, disagreeing with veterinary assessment.  “The cat was a violent drug addict, and I ignored the symptoms.  Now my baby is dead.”
Don’t ignore the symptoms.  If your cat is addicted to catnip, it must be arrested/jailed.

Proof That Cats Were Not Created by God,"
Posted By: Adam Nelson
December 29, 2012


Unlike all other animals on Earth, cats are unholy and born with natural sin.  From the time it comes clawing from its mother’s womb, a cat is a reprehensible beast who represents the worst qualities that humanity can imagine:  social welfare mooching, clingy, remarkably germy, defiant, ungrateful and unChristian.  With such blatantly bad qualities, it is a shock that any sane people would want to own a cat.  But beyond the simple realities of why cat ownership is bad, there is Biblical historical authority that proves cats are unholy and can bring about the fall of civilization.
In short, cats are not of God.  Cats are of the devil.
When you read through all of the Bible, you will quickly notice one fact:  cats are the only domestic animal never mentioned in the Bible.  In a historical archive of humanity’s spiritual history and Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth (what Bible stands for), God is so repulsed by cats that he forbids the mention of them in his Holy Book.
By this logic, cats are more evil than Satan.  The devil can at least be talked about in the Bible, but despite their widespread presence in the time of ancient Egypt -where a good portion of the Bible was reported- notice how they are not talked about.
Ancient Cats And the Bible
Scientists agree that domestic cats were created 10,000 years ago, some 4,000 years before God created mankind.  Cats were created as an ethereal companion pet of Satan, who likely stroked them as he wrote demonic metal music and plotted to overthrow God in heaven.  As we know, Satan’s little planned coup-de-tat failed and he was thrown into the lowest pits of hell, where all his demons belong burning for all eternity.
Somehow in God’s wrath, cats were spared and eventually allowed to live on Earth with all the other animals created by God.  It seems that God cast cats out of heaven and onto Earth about 10,000 years ago, with ancient Egypt being the site of their first residence.
The first cats that crept upon the Earth were duplicitious at best.  Any cat owner will tell you that cats are unbelievably sneaky and smart, usually able to open doors and perform small feats that defy God’s physics and constraints for Earth.  It is this ‘supernatural’ or magic ability that explains why cats serve as familiars for Wiccan atheists as well as pure witches.
Toxoplasmosis parasite fully grown will wrap around the brain stem of a weak-willed human, usually a woman, then urge them to do the will of cats and Satan. This is Satan’s new way of reproducing.
But all this started in ancient Egypt.  God sent Moses to free the children of Israel, but King Pharoah was already under the influence of t0xoplasmosis.  This parasite is pictured at right and is usually located in clutches of microscopic billions, as it is the sperm of Satan himself.

"Opinion: All of this is why I chose not to have any other MPs
","By David Seymour.
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
I say “hi” four times so each of you get your own greeting. Everyone deserves their own “hi.” That’s why in an ACT government, we’ll be promoting our Legal Hi Bill. Everyone deserves a legal hi.
Over the past four years, many New Zealanders have asked me why I chose to be elected as a one-person party. I’ll tell you why.
It’s because you can’t be tripped up if there’s no one there to trip you up.
Unless you’re dancing. Very easy to trip up if you’re dancing.
This week, we’ve seen the danger of political parties with more than one MP. If they’re not calling you corrupt, you’re calling them f-word-ing useless. And it’s just not very nice.
When I started ACTing, I said to myself, “David, you’re in ACT now. Have a treat.”
After I finished my Pixie Caramel, I said to myself, “David, you’re in ACT now. What’s most libertarian in life?”
Getting your own way, of course. And what’s the best way to get your own way? Being the only person there.
Being the only MP, it’s my choice whether we go with Chinese or Indian. I get to eat whatever lunch I like.
It takes two to tango but it only takes one to avoid paying for someone else.
So where to next? As long as I’m in charge, you can be guaranteed that ACT will never have more than one MP.
In fact, why should any party have more than one MP? No more in-fighting. No more pointless debates.
Let’s just start a Parliament of 120 one-person parties. Imagine how much we could get done.
Or better yet, a Parliament with just one one-person party. Think about it. If we had just one person making all the decisions, then nobody could tell me what to do.

"How many Maureen Pughs is one Chinese worth?
","Former Governor General Jerry Mateparae, pictured here during an early valuation of National MP Maureen Pugh
Yesterday former National MP Jami-Lee Ross released an explosive recording in which opposition leader Simon Bridges described one of his MPs, Maureen Pugh, as “fucking useless.”
Bridges and Ross also discussed how two Chinese MPs were apparently worth more than two Indian MPs, and so we thought it was only appropriate to consult an expert on how many Maureen Pughs one Chinese MP would be worth, and other, similar questions relating to the value of members in a National caucus.
Spokesperson for the TAB, Kate Gourdie, was happy to offer us some rough values.
“I suppose the one problem we have, to begin with, is that Bridges and Ross don’t specifically discuss exactly how much one Indian is worth in relation to one Chinese, only that one Indian is worth less,” said Gourdie.
“What we can gather, though, is that one Maureen Pugh is worth substantially less than either, and not very much at all, really.
“Working backwards from there, if we’re to assume that one Indian is worth slightly more than half of one Chinese – given that neither Ross or Bridges used the terminology ‘less than half’, which we might expect in such a case – then we can estimate that five Maureen Pughs are worth about one Chinese MP, and three Maureen Pughs are worth about one Indian MP.”

"Opinion: Honestly, I am fucking useless
","By Maureen Pugh.
Simon was right.
I am fucking useless.
I’m not ashamed of it. I never have been. In fact, that’s why I became an MP.
I became an MP because I wanted to represent you, the people of West Coast-Tasman, and if there’s one thing I know, it’s that you’re useless. You’re fucking useless. We’re all fucking useless.
For too long have our politicians represented the able, the competent, the capable, the generally sentient. But why should our national representatives only reflect those of us who can do, and not those of us who cannot?
Some of us can hardly get dressed in the morning. We’re not a tiny minority. We might even be a majority.
Sure, we all pretend to be capable, to go to work, to understand, to not have done anything wrong, to even have jobs at all. Some of us pretend to have houses and then sneak home to our cars.
Have you ever got up in the morning and downed three glasses of red wine because you can’t face the day?
Have you ever said something so embarrassing to someone that you just pray they didn’t even hear you properly?
Have you ever received negative feedback and then used that as an excuse to never try again?
Did you see Venom?
Have you ever spent a whole day doing absolutely nothing and then just to make yourself feel better and keep up appearances you make up some story about something you’re going to do and tell everyone so that they think you have your life together?
Well that’s me. All of that is me. I’m you, and I’m useless.
I’m from a place called Kumara, for fuck’s sake. I’m from a place named after a potato.
Can any of you honestly say that none of your parents, your spouses, your friends, your loved ones, or yes, your employers, have ever described you as fucking useless?
If you can, I don’t want your vote, because it would be intimidating, and then I might have to do something.
So when Simon says i’m useless, I don’t take that as an insult, because that’s precisely what I’m here to be. I’m here to be useless.
I’m here to go to local events and wave and forget your name even though I’ve met you three times in the last two weeks, and I’m here for locals to gawk at and say “How is she a politician? Is that the best we’ve got? What a fucking joke.”
But when you say that, at least you can know that you, too, can be a politician. Because if you didn’t have me, if you weren’t represented by someone as fucking useless as you are, it might forever seem out of reach. You might feel that I know best, and perhaps you wouldn’t feel as comfortable telling me what to do.

"Judith Collins loses all control of host body
","There are fears in Collins’ camp that the real Jami-Lee Ross may be regaining control of his mind.
National MP Judith Collins is said to be panicking after her mind lost all control of one of its host bodies in the late hours of this morning.
The body, apparently accelerating its programming by several years, went on a 50-minute press conference rampage, accusing leader Simon Bridges of everything from election finance fraud to fabricating claims of sexual harassment.
In the most extraordinary press conference in recent New Zealand political history, the body – which once belonged to Botany MP Jami-Lee Ross – took a blowtorch to the leadership of the National Party, who simultaneously voted to expel him.
“Simon Bridges is a big bad, not even smart, not even good, not even going to be Prime Minister kind of a guy,” read Ross’ body from a pre-prepared statement. “He is selfish, dishonest, a bully, rude, possibly a cannibal, and worse, a jerk.”
He claimed that Bridges had committed “significant crimes” and attempted to fabricate sexual harassment claims against him, even going so far as to hire real women to be involuntarily harrassed by him.
Ross’ body is part of the Judith Collins Drone MP Programme, a project to utilise the formerly free minds of National Party MPs to exact her will upon her enemies.
Sources close to Collins say that while the body was broadly following its long-term commands, it was carrying them out “much too quickly.”
“We’re talking about roughly two years of operations being carried out in the space of an hour,” said one confidant. “These things were supposed to be methodically planted, carefully weaved into the fabric of caucus’ consciousness, little bits leaked here and there. But this morning was a disaster. He just went and read every last bit of it out to the media. There hasn’t even been time to plant evidence for some of this stuff.”
This isn’t the first time that one of Collins’ host bodies has gone rogue – early prototypes of the programme, Aaron Gilmore and Todd Barclay, also backfired in public – but neither of those incidents were anywhere near as destructive as this one is proving to be, and it may be just the beginning.
Ross’ body continues to level accusations from his Twitter account, blaming Simon Bridges for the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, trapping 12 Thai boys in a cave for several weeks, and The Spinoff TV.
He also said Bridges knows he isn’t the one who leaked his expense details in August because “he’s the leak.”
Bridges has vehemently denied all the claims levelled against him, except the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which he said he was “pretty sure” about, but would “have to check my diary.”
The National leader continually emphasized the unanimous support of his caucus, multi-tasking as he frantically checked his phone while talking to journalists.
“55 MPs have today said they stand by me as leader, hold on, just, let me,” he trailed off, while replying to a text. “54 MPs have today said they stand by me as leader, and believe I am the best chance we have of…”
His phone went again.
“Sorry, the best chance we have of taking this party to victory in 2020. And as I’ve had the chance to hear from all 53 of them today, they all support me. So I repeat, I have the full, unequivocal support of 52 MPs, 51 National MPs.
“Jami has decided to take the path he’s taken today, he’s going to be held responsible for that, but for the rest of us, we’re moving a forward as a united caucus of 50 MPs.”
Judith Collins, meanwhile, has been trying desperately to regain control of Ross, and posted a series of bizarre tweets that may be attempts to activate his kill switch.




Two other MPs that are part of the Collins Drone MP Programme, Simeon Brown and Chris Penk, have been recalled until the cause of Ross’ unravelling has been isolated.
Despite Collins’ efforts, Ross is still alive, and in the last hour, put out a press release saying he had “forgot some stuff,” and is planning another press conference in 20 minutes.",NaN,16/10/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rossroguefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Just how much of the $2 billion Kiwibuild fund has Phil Twyford spent on Fortnite?
","On the left is one thing we’re talking about. On the right is another thing we’re talking about. You see them here juxtaposed. You are now informed.
One Auckland mother is reportedly furious and distraught after finding her finances several million dollars short due to purchases in the video game Fortnite by one of her ministers.
The minister, 55-year-old Phil, has reportedly racked up untold numbers of cosmetic purchases on the mother’s account without her knowledge, and the wider family has been left to pick up the pieces.
The popular new game has proved dangerous to children all over the globe, entrapping them with the use of fun and a distraction from the increasingly undeniable pointlessness of existence.
The game has become popular enough that it has forced media to cover it, causing headaches for journalists who are young enough to know plenty about video games but with an old enough audience they still have to write like they’re imbeciles.
The game has apparently captured the imagination of Housing Minister Phil Twyford, who has allegedly spent “millions” of the $2 billion fund on the video game.
But Twyford says the amount he’s spent on the game is negligible “in the scheme of things.”
Later asked to clarify what was meant by the “scheme of things,” a written response from the minister’s office read “Things generally.”
But privately, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Finance Minister Grant Robertson are fuming, and a loud argument took place on Wednesday in Twyford’s bedroom, which he has refused to come out of since.
“What are these?” growled Ardern, waving a series of bank statements.
“Hats,” said Twyford.
“HATS!?”
“For my character.”
To meet his targets, Twyford needs to complete 1,000 houses by July 1st next year, 150 of which were meant to be built in Minecraft.
But Twyford has been spending relatively little time on that video game, instead racking up hundreds of hours in Fortnite, which he tells Ardern and Robertson is “much more fun.”
“Minecraft is boring!” he screeched at them. “You can’t kill anybody, it’s just placing blocks for hours, and I have no idea how we’re going to insure them against creepers.”
Twyford said it was going to be “extremely difficult” telling new homeowners chosen in the Kiwibuild ballot that their house was “just a Minecraft house.”
“They will not be pleased,” he said. “Especially because, six of them, I didn’t even know how to access the stone blocks, so they’re just wood blocks, and also one of them’s next to a big pool of lava.”
“One is made of dirt,” he added.
He was also quick to point out that you can “build stuff” in Fortnite too, though he wasn’t sure whether weaponised fortresses counted towards the targets.
The Government has been in contact with Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite, to try and seek a refund on Twyford’s purchases, but a spokesperson for the company said it was “up to parents” to police the spending habits of their 55-year-old housing ministers.",NaN,12/10/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/philfortnitefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Water Whirler doubles in value after beaning titanic douchemonger
","Praise has been ubiquitous for the inanimate carbon rod.
The Wellington man who broke the Len Lye Water Whirler sculpture may be relieved today after a report revealed that his antics on the waterfront art piece have actually doubled its value, an increase largely attributed to the whirler’s violent crowning of its assailant.
A panel of experts assessed the sculpture’s value following the incident, and were immediately struck by how much value it had gained.
“When I first went down to the waterfront, I was completely blown away,” said art evaluator Matilda Rice. “We set up our equipment, took some measurements, and at first we thought there must be something interfering with our readings.”
The sculpture was initially worth $300,000 when constructed, but Rice and her colleagues arrived at a final measurement of $703,002.29.
“Initially, we figured it must be because it was destroyed – when you destroy a piece of art, it immediately doubles in value, we know that’s often the case – but as we began talking to people, we got a fuller picture.”
Rice said the sculpture had become “revered” for the way it dispatched of the complete spoonhead who tried to climb it.
A comprehensive report attributed the new worth of the sculpture to the “brilliant way” in which it “totally nailed that imbecile right square in his big dumb skull.”
Rice cautioned that you could “never be sure” why exactly a piece of art was worth what it was worth, but all indications point to “the absolute clobbering of this total fuckwit.”
None of this has come at any surprise to the wider public, amongst which the whirler has become exceedingly popular after video of it Joyceing the douchebag right in the fucking noggin went viral.
Stan Walker has written a tribute to the whirler, which he is performing under the stage name Stan Whirler, and the sculpture has been offered a role as co-host on +HR=E comedy show Whirler and Ben*.
Despite its new found popularity, the whirler remains unrepaired, and Wellington Mayor, Justin Lester, has sensed an opportunity to pay for its reconstruction by valuing the sculpture even further.
To do this, Lester has attempted to reach out to England street artist Banksy, asking him to please break the sculpture again.
Lester posted his comment on the Instagram page of @bankywellington, who is neither the real Banksy, nor in Wellington.


Neither Banksy or Banky W have responded to the mayor’s plea.
Len Lye was unavailable for comment due to his latest project of having his corpse encased in wood underground for the remainder of time.

"Government will provide therapy for business owners to help them feel more confident
","Numbers notably don’t indicate whether it’s the business owners or if the businesses themselves are sad.
In an attempt to ease plummeting business confidence, the not-Labour-led Government says it plans to spend some of its unexpectedly large surplus on therapy for those business owners who are not feeling so confident right now.
Finance Minister Grant Robertson said he was “deeply saddened” to see how much confidence business owners had lost over the last year, and the Government wanted to do something to help.
“We can’t be sure why business owners have lost so much confidence,” he said. “Maybe they’re really bad at their jobs, maybe their businesses are failing and it’s completely their fault, maybe they’re a waste of space, but during Mental Health Week, it would be negligent for us to leave the problem unaddressed.”
Robertson said the Government would target business owners with the lowest confidence for a “full round” of counseling sessions, and set up a helpline for any other business owners not feeling optimistic about either themselves or the long-term fiscal outlook of the nation’s finances or economic growth.
National has scoffed at the plan, but also said some things about it.
“Really I think most people see this as a bad joke,” said National Party leader and that one wedding guest you can’t quite place Simon Bridges. “It’s not a coincidence that business confidence has fallen since this coalition was formed.”
Bridges said business owners were “feeling sad” because the Prime Minister and others had said “mean things” about them and “made them feel bad about themselves.”
“This government blames businesses for everything. They blame businesses for pollution. They blame businesses for making plastic bags. They blame businesses for carbon emissions. They blame businesses for all kinds of things that businesses do.”
Bridges said it was “incredibly important” not to make businesses feel bad because businesses “make stuff” and they “might stop.”
“I can tell you in my experience that I once spent weeks on end trying to get this one tuft of hair just above the part here, just this one here,” he said, pointing as his head. “I once spent weeks trying to get that to sit left, instead of shooting up, like you can see here, and about halfway through the process, someone in the street said ‘Oi, Simon, fix your hair!’ and that was pretty demoralising, to be honest, and I just stopped. I didn’t try to fix it anymore. It was halfway fixed and they were still being mean, and after a while, what’s the point? Those are the stakes we’re dealing with.”
Bridges said there was a “very good reason” business confidence was measured, because “business owners matter.”
“We don’t measure the confidence of other types of people.”",NaN,11/10/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/grantrobertsonconfidencefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Proctor struggles to explain why he also took two cans of beans, a beer, 60 dollars, and a bath
","Despite his name and appearance, Dave Scott insists he is just “a human” and not “some kind of proctorbot.”
Otago University proctor Dave Scott has landed himself in hot water this week after entering a student flat without permission and stealing three bongs.
Scott, who has publicly apologised today and acknowledged he made a mistake, says he was just trying to protect the students from possible police action, and was doing it out of concern for them.
But at a 3pm press conference this afternoon, he failed to coherently explain to media why he also took two cans of beans, a couch cushion, a Playstation 4, a Rush Hour DVD set, a beer, 60 dollars, and had a bath before leaving.
“Look, everything I did, I did with the students’ well-being in mind,” he said. “Did I cross a line at times? Absolutely, but for one, there were too many beans in that flat. You don’t need sixteen cans, I know you buy them all because they keep and you think at some point you’re going to use them, but I think most students understand that those cans just get moved from flat to flat to flat and then eventually into a family home until you finally get the courage to put them straight in the bin, and there are families that could use beans that you’re not using; my family, for example.
“The cushion? Uh, look, didn’t fit the couch, wasn’t even from the same couch that it was on. Just trying to find that a home.
“The Playstation 4, study distraction.
“Rush Hour? Kind of a racist franchise.”
Scott could not explain why he took the beer and 60 dollars, but said that taking a bath was “not a criminal act.”
Legal experts spoken to about the matter agreed that taking a bath is not a crime.

"Australian fruit brands promise items found in strawberries will be ‘more fun’ from now on
","Strawberries have traditionally contained more strawberry.
Australian fruit brands affected by the recent spate of needles found in their strawberries are attempting to win back customers by promising that items found in their fruit will be “much more fun” from now on, and while there was still an unfortunate risk that you might find a needle in your strawberry, there would also be a “pretty decent chance” you might “find something neat” instead.
The strawberry needle scare threatened to spread to New Zealand this week, after a needle was found in a Choice brand punnet of strawberries from an Auckland Countdown, sparking fears that panic could begin affecting sales here.
But Australian growers are now hitting back, atempting to drum up demand by balancing out the risk with an incentive.
A spokesperson for Countdown, which sources the Choice strawberries from Western Australia, said it will be restocking the brand shortly, with the assurance that there would now be “all kinds of great items” in the fruit.
“No one wants to find a needle in their strawberry,” said Countdown’s Mary Davis, “but what about a tiny Boba Fett? Or some MDMA?”
Kevin Tran, the boss of Berry Obsession and Berry Luscious – two other brands implicated in the needle saga – said he would be instructing his fruit pickers and packagers to take a “similar approach.”
“‘Fun’ isn’t really the right word,” he said, “but we’ll certainly be looking to put more useful items in the strawberries, like matches or screws.”
Tran said the feedback to the needles found inside his strawberries had been “generally negative.”
“You do get the odd person who was a little light on sewing needles, and said ‘Hey, thanks Kevin’, but then for everyone like that there’s someone else who got a needle lodged in the roof of their mouth, so at best, it’s probably a wash.”
It remains to be seen whether putting a wider, more helpful variety of items in fruit will drive customers back to the shelves, but one former Whittakers employee was optimistic for the brands, saying that New Zealanders would buy food with “pretty much anything in it.”",NaN,25/09/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/strawberriesneedlesfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Recent whale sightings in Wellington may just be whales trying to stockpile plastic bags
","Scientists are concerned whale civilizations will never advance if we stop sending them plastic bags.
Department of Conservation experts believe that recent sightings of Southern right whales in Wellington Harbour may be related to the upcoming plastic bag ban that will be implemented by the government.
Southern right whales have been spotted in the harbour twice this year in a relatively short space of time, fuelling speculation about why now.
But Nadine Bott, a DoC whale expert, says the answer is likely to be quite a simple one.
“Just as all of us at home are rushing to the supermarket, putting a miniature Picnic Bar in one whole plastic bag, and then re-entering the supermarket only to do that fifty more times over, whales, too, are stockpiling for the inevitable,” she said. “Where we get our plastic bags from supermarkets and drawers we haven’t opened for years, whales and dolphins get their plastic bags when we throw ours into the ocean.
“If we stop using them, their supply dries up.”
Bott said the whale and its calf that visited Wellington in August were both seen leaving with a “long string” of plastic bags tailing behind them, that they’d likely collected from the rubbish flowing into Lambton Harbour and Oriental Bay.
“So while some would say that maybe we’re seeing these whales due to a rebounding population, the truth may actually be that it’s a sign of a community about to fall on hard times.”
National Party environment spokesman Scott Simpson is calling on the government to address the problem when the ban is finally implemented.
“Of all the people I hear from about this plastic bag ban,” he said, “it’s more than anything whales and dolphins and seagulls and small crustaceans and they ask me two things more than anything else: they ask me ‘Who are you?’ and the second thing they ask me is: ‘Where are we going to get our plastic bags? Because we can’t manufacture them because we don’t have hands,’ and I take that seriously.”
Simpson suggested the government could charter fishing boats to sail out into the ocean “where we know there are whale populations,” and dump thousands of plastic bags, “at least as a short term solution.”
“We can’t just cut off their supply, throw our hands in the air, and say ‘not our problem,'”, he said.
But Minister for the Environment David Parker said New Zealand was a small country, and he was confident whales would get their plastic bags “from just about everywhere else.”",NaN,08/09/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/whalesplasticbagsfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Ardern reaffirms that she still won’t be firing Clare Curran
","Former Broadcasting Minister Clare Curran may have lost her job, but she survives another day without being fired from it.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is holding firm today, saying she still won’t be firing Broadcasting Minister Clare Curran, even after accepting her resignation.
Curran, who resigned yesterday following a decision to do so Thursday night, had struggled to answer questions this week about her use of a gmail account, fuelling speculation by the opposition that she may be secretly using a hotmail account, something that would demonstrate poor taste.
Rumours circulating Wellington had also claimed Curran had been spotted with a Yahoo account with a xtra.co.nz suffix, but those rumours have yet to be substantiated.
Yesterday morning, Ardern told news programme The Matt & Jerry Show that she wouldn’t be firing Curran, but Curran resigned just hours later, throwing some doubt on the Prime Minister’s statements.
Opposition leader and untapped oil field Simon Bridges said Ardern had “misled New Zealanders” when she told Newstalk ZB that she wouldn’t be “cutting ties” with her broadcasting minister.
“In the morning, the Prime Minister says she won’t be firing her minister, but later that afternoon, that same minister resigns, so evidently, she wasn’t being truthful.”
But Ardern continues to stand firm on her version of events, saying today that she still won’t be firing Curran.
“No, absolutely not,” she reiterated this afternoon. “In this job, there are ups and downs. I think of all us in Wellington are well aware that we have good days, and bad days, and occasionally, we’ll have a stroke in front of everybody on national television. I think she’s paid the price.
“As I have said, I won’t be firing Clare, and I’ll be continuing to not fire Clare for the forseeable future.”
But political analysts view the situation as something of a boiling frog, saying that Ardern will be “forced” to fire Curran “sooner or later.”
“It just reaches a point where, no matter what you try, something has to give,” said 1 News political editor Jessica Mutch. “You can explain the situation, you can downplay it, you can pivot, you can accept their full resignation from cabinet, maybe even politics entirely, or you might even get lucky and they die, but at the end of the day, you still have to fire them.”
Sources close to the Prime Minister’s office say that several other cabinet ministers have approached her to ask whether her not firing them meant she wanted their resignation.",NaN,08/09/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/currannotfiredfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Far-right speaking event cancelled again, but ‘Phil Goff is a prick’ event to go ahead at council venues
","Sorry Phil Goff. Free speech strikes again.
The long-planned Phil Goff is a Gigantic Prick Festival is set to go ahead at multiple council-owned venues tonight, a welcome relief for the organiser, who worried a pair of far-right Canadian speakers would threaten his completely unrelated and otherwise peaceful triennial event.
Kevin Henare, who has no association with or sympathy towards Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux, said he became worried about the future of his festival when Phil Goff made the call to ban the pair from council-owned venues last month.
“We’ve been doing this for a long time,” he said, “and we’ve never really had a problem, but when those two got banned by Phil Goff, I thought ‘Oh shit, I hope he doesn’t see our event.'”
A spokesperson for the Auckland mayor said the event was “allowed” and “okay” but that Goff “doesn’t want to talk about it.”
“No, really,” Goff told media personally later this afternoon. “I don’t want to talk about it. Can we move on to a different topic, guys?”
Goff pivoted to an answer about the Southern and Molyneux event, saying he was “very glad” planned venue The Powerstation had decided not to host them.
“These really are uniquely repugnant views,” he said.
“What about the Phil Goff is a Gigantic Prick people? Are they repugnant?” interjected a local reporter.
Goff sighed, and stared at the ground, shaking his head.
“Look, it’s, they’re technically allowed, if there’s no racism or-”
“No, no racism, they just hate you.”
“Yeah, okay, well, just, watch it.”

"Opinion: Will Steven Adams at least play table tennis for New Zealand?
","By sports columnist Jock Harrison.
If Steven Adams has any decency left – and you’d have to say, it looks like he doesn’t – then he’ll at least consider playing table tennis for New Zealand. Or something relatively easy, like lawn balls, for goodness sake.
How hard can it be? Front up mate. Do the right thing. Play for the country that pushed you, headfirst, through its big, testosterone-coated birth canal into the light of Rotorua. The country that gave you everything. The country that gave you a birth certificate. The country that gave you a passport. The country that gave you passing media coverage at 6:47pm one night a week.
Honest to Lomu, I’ve had it up to here with these self-loathing, unpatriotic kiwis making excuses for Steven Adams over his neglectful, selfish attitude towards our game, New Zealand’s game: basketball.
Look mate, you were born in New Zealand. Isn’t that enough? What more do you want from us? Is it money? Is it moral support? Is it actual local interest in the game that you love as opposed to a blind desire to win at everything even if we don’t really even know what it is?
How selfish can you be?
You don’t see your sister throwing puts for the Oklahoma shotput team.
You never will. It doesn’t exist, and every dead-to-rights New Zealand sports fanatic knows the Oklahama City Lightning wouldn’t exist without you, either, mate.
And neither can we. You’re holding us back. We don’t have time to wait until Richie McCaw’s baby grows up. We need you now, and you’re holding us to ransom.
You’re effectively saying “No, I won’t play for New Zealand Basketball, just because New Zealand Basketball didn’t support me when I was young, just because I already have a job that pays $22 million a year that I need to focus on, just because nobody really cares about international basketball anyway, just because I’m a dirty ******* ****.”
I get it. You’re bitter because you and a bunch of poor kids couldn’t afford to play in the junior national league. But you clearly never wanted it anyway, because now you can afford it, and you still refuse to pay to do it.
You don’t want to play basketball for New Zealand? Fine.
Win us something else then. Win us table tennis. Have you seen those guys? They’re tiny. You could win us the world cup in a day.
Is there a world cup? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter. We want it.
Sailing. You could help us with that. Big arms. Boats. Sailing.
Gymnastics. Probably not. But honestly, you’re not going to play basketball, so tough.

"Disappointment: Six weeks on, Jacinda Ardern’s daughter Neve has achieved nothing
","If the baby of a Prime Minister can’t dress itself, what hope do the rest of us have?
As Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern returns to work this week, there are growing questions over what her having a baby was even for in the first place.
Six weeks on since the much-hyped birth of Ardern’s child, it appears to have done absolutely nothing for itself, the country, or the economy. Early indicators suggest that it may have even cost the country money, money which it has yet to pay back.
Opposition leader and rare breed of tightly wound poodle Simon Bridges laid some responsibility at the feet of the Prime Minister earlier today.
“Obviously Natalie and I, still very happy for Jacinda and Clarke, but I think New Zealanders at this point are wondering why we did any of this?” he said. “We spent a lot of time on it, a lot of energy, a lot of coverage, a lot of time in the hospital, that costs the taxpayer obviously, and she spent six weeks personally on the project, and I think at some point, kiwis were expecting that we would actually see something out of it.”
Bridges acknowledged that none of his three children had done anything to benefit the country, but said it wasn’t his job to benefit the country.
“I’m more of a bystander, on a corner,” said Bridges. “I kind of stand there and say ‘Hey, don’t do that’ or ‘Hey, you’re about to rear-end that person,’ except I don’t say it too loudly, because I actually kind of want them to.”
The Prime Minister has spent her first day back on the job defending the baby in candid interviews with Alison Mau, Tova O’Brien and others.
“Has Neve achieved anything? Oh, absolutely,” she told Mau, emphatically. “Absolutely. I absolutely refuse to accept that my daughter has been anything but an achievement for all sorts of reasons, including – but not limited to – newspaper sales.”
Ardern said it was obviously “comical” and “ridiculous” that anyone would expect Neve to have achieved anything personally or professionally at this stage in her life, because she’s “an Aucklander.”
One man, who wished not to be identified, said he was “especially annoyed” by how “utterly useless” the child has turned out to be.
“Every day is hell,” he said. “It can’t do anything for itself. It can’t make dinner. It can’t mow the lawn. It can’t turn on the TV. Worse: it can’t turn off the TV. Yesterday, it vomited on me. I’ve grown a beard because I honestly have no time to shave.”
Despite her dismissal of the criticism, Ardern appeared to cave to political pressure today, telling media that baby Neve would be accompanying her on her upcoming trip to the United Nations, possibly to provide her with an opportunity to finally do something.",NaN,02/08/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/neveachievednothingfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Teachers’ strike to be met with resistance by nationwide parents’ strike
","Primary school students are looking forward to the strike actions.
In two weeks time, primary school aged children across the country will be left to fend entirely for themselves, after New Zealand’s parenting union announced retaliatory measures against the planned primary school teachers’ strike.
On August 15th, primary school teachers will go on strike for a full day, a move that will shut down schools across the country, leaving children nowhere to colour in 18-year-old worksheets.
This was expected to leave children dangerously in the hands of their parents for the day, forcing them to take time out from their adult colouring-in jobs.
But that will no longer be the case, after a late announcement this evening that over a hundred thousand adults will be walking from their jobs as parents, as a form of protest agaisnt the teachers’ strike.
A statement from New Zealand parenting union PARENTZ (Parents And Ratepayers Encouraging New Thinking Zealand) laid out the case for the strike:
“Following a vote this afternoon, New Zealand parents will cease parenting at 6am on August 15th, and not resume parenting duties until 6am the following morning.
“We do not take this action lightly, but feel our hands have been forced by the expansion of parenting time being requested of us by NZEI.
“For too long, New Zealand’s primary school teachers have felt they can just dump our children with us from 3pm to 9am the next morning without paying us anything approaching reasonable compensation.
“Requiring an extra six hours from us on August 15th was the final straw, and we refuse to be pushed around.”
PARENTZ said the parents of primary school aged children will refuse to acknowledge their childrens’ existence or let them into their homes for the duration of the strike.
“No parenting whatsoever, unless our demands are met, which is that the teachers’ demands are not met.”
The move has raised the stakes in the standoff between teachers and the government, as many now fear landless, nomadic children will cause chaos, clogging up the arteries of major cities and forming roaming street gangs.
Acting Prime Minister Winston Peters, who had earlier called the teachers’ strike “hugely disappointing,” threw more fuel on the fire just over an hour ago, saying that he was “fully behind” the parents’ strike.
MPs across the political spectrum agreed, many of them vowing to fight the teachers’ protest by neglecting their children even more than they normally do.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will herself be joining the parents’ stand, starting her own parenting strike tomorrow.",NaN,01/08/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/teachersstrikefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Police hope to have speeding ticket gift vouchers available in time for Christmas
","Expect to see these billboards popping up later this year.
New Zealand Police say they now expect to have their latest revenue-raising measure in place by Christmas this year, providing a much-needed funding boost to the force.
From December 15th, Kiwis will have the option of buying speeding ticket vouchers for friends or family, which can be used to pay speeding fines incurred in future.
Apparently still Police Commissioner Mike Bush said the move would be a “win-win” for the public and for police.
“If a loved one is kind enough to pay for you to have one of these,” he said, holding aloft a prototype version of the vouchers, “then you’ll have however much is on here deducted from your speeding ticket. This will be a particularly good Christmas gift for those who regularly find themselves going just a little too fast.
“Or a lot too fast, if you want to purchase the premium vouchers that also protect you from a certain number of demerits.”
Vouchers would be of a one-to-one dollar value, and free or discounted speeding tickets would have to be redeemed within a three month window.
Bush said the vouchers would “do nothing” for you if you were caught drink driving, but in somewhat related plans NZ Police were considering brewing their own brand of beer, to be on sale by 2020.
“We can’t promise you’ll not get charged, but if you can prove you’re drunk on our beer, we certainly might go a bit easier on you,” he said.

"Winston Peters fired entire Cabinet on Thursday but every journalist was at the hospital
","The birth of Prime Minister Ardern’s first child has overshadowed some staffing alterations back in Wellington.
Acting Prime Minister Winston Peters fired the entirety of Jacinda Ardern’s Cabinet shortly after taking the reins on Thursday morning, but this wasn’t reported until now as every political journalist in the country was eating snacks in the Auckland Hospital cafeteria.
It has taken a total of four days for the news to find its way to national headlines, and Peters says the move is now “old news” and that the media should “move on” and “find something else to get hysterical about.”
“Four. Days,” he reiterated, speaking from the Prime Minister’s podium at the Beehive this morning. “Four. Days. This is ancient history. Do you know what’s happened in this country since then? What’s that? No, of course you don’t. That’s not a surprise, I’ll tell you that.”
“We were at the hospital!” came several groans from the press pool.
“Well I’m sorry sunshine, I’m not answering questions about something that’s totally irrelevant now,” replied Peters. “Next question.”
“Isn’t it still relevant whether you fired the entire government?” asked Three political editor Tova O’Brien.
“Come on, Tova, you know this stuff. Try asking an honest question next time,” was the Acting PM’s response.
“Is there still a Cabinet?” asked TVNZ’s Corin Dann.
“Is there still a Cabinet?” scoffed Peters. “What is this nonsense? Of course there’s a Cabinet, alright?”
“Who’s in it?”
“Well, I’ll tell you one thing: I’m in it, and we had a very productive meeting this morning and if I were you, I’d be asking about that.”
The back-and-forth between the Acting Prime Minister and journalists continued, as it became increasingly clear that the Cabinet meeting in question had been a wide-ranging discussion between its only two remaining members: Peters and a bottle of GlenDronach.

"David Seymour asks why the government needs to provide holidays when you can already buy them online
","Seymour suggested employees could choose to take all of their annual holidays on the same day, which could even have the added bonus of helping them not lose their job.
ACT Party leader and star of recent Three mockumentary series Dancing with the Stars has questioned the need for government mandated public holidays, saying that in the modern world, holidays are already widely available on the internet.
“There was a time when a holiday wasn’t that easy to come by, I understand that,” said Seymour today, as he took several hours off work to practice the cha-cha in his office. “But in the modern world, with travel agencies, websites, snap deals, and that Trivago lady, they’re honestly everywhere.
“Why do I – as a taxpayer – need the government to provide me a holiday when I can get one to Bali for just $1200 on a specific date in five years time?”
Seymour said there were “all kinds of packages” and kiwis were hardly starved for choice.
“There’s so many holidays available that they even pop up when you don’t want to see them, on your Facebook, in your email, signs at the mall.
“I think people should be able to make their own holiday arrangements. We don’t need the Government to tell us when to take the day off.
“I’m just not into the Government telling people how to use their annual leave. What is this? A fascist state?”
Seymour was of course referencing the 1930s regimes of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, who brought terror to their countries by enforcing public holidays on their workers, and in Germany, extra public holidays for Jewish people.
Seymour says it’s ultimately about freedom of choice, and that it would enable people to celebrate holidays “pretty much whenever.”
“It’s actually a positive thing we’re saying,” he said. “We’re telling people, ‘Hey, you don’t have to celebrate Christmas on December 25th if your boss doesn’t want you to.'”",NaN,20/06/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/seymourholidaysfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"As nation waits for baby, medical experts say it might just stay in there forever
","Doctors say if the baby hasn’t arrived at the end of the week, it probably won’t.
Three days have passed since Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was due to give birth to the greatest baby known to have ever been born in these parts, and as the hours drag on with no news, fears are beginning to emerge that it may never be born.
Medical experts contacted by media today say it is “not impossible” that the baby simply decides never to come out, and that it “may have no real reason to.”
“Typically, babies come out of the womb, at some juncture and in some fashion,” said Auckland obstetrician Lynda Batchelor. “But it’s certainly easy to see why they might not.”
Batchelor said the world was a “complicated” and “often depressing place”, and the inside of the womb was relatively “warm, safe, and food doesn’t cost any money.”
“No taxes or mean bosses, either,” she added.
“And no Mondays.”
Dr. Phillip Beattie, also an ostrichian, agreed, saying that the fact three days had passed since the due date did sugget the baby was showing “at least some signs of hesitation.”
“The baby knows when it’s due,” he said. “It can tell because of a tiny clock in the hypothalamus.
“So the fact it hasn’t come out yet suggests it feels the time is still not right, and perhaps no time will ever be right.”
Beattie said it would be “entirely possible” for Ardern to live with the baby “as is,” but that it would be “very uncomfortable” and become “increasingly difficult” as the baby grew older.
Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters say he has grown increasingly nervous about this prospect.
Peters has long looked forward to his several-week stint as Acting Prime Minister, the end of a long dry spell lasting two decades.
But if the baby never comes, he may be left out in the cold.
Via a statement from his office yesterday, Peters announced that when he takes the reins of the country, he will be holding press conferences at the Beehive “regularly” and “often” and “routinely” and “always.”
A press conference will be held at the Prime Minister’s podium once every two hours on weekdays.
The first of each day will address major issues facing the country, while the subsequent seven press conferences will address arguments about the previous one.
Arguments are “strongly anticipated.”
In the statement, Peters’ office urged journalists to be “on time” and “come armed with the facts for once.”
“If you think you’re going to show up here with a pre-written story, and a bunch of trick questions, then by golly, you’ve got another thing coming.”
An early version of the statement – now retracted – appeared to be addressed solely to former Newshub political editor Lloyd Burr, who isn’t even in the country anymore.
Those close to Peters say he’ll be “crushed” if he doesn’t get to “live this out.”
He has reportedly sent a spring snake joke toy to the Prime Minister, in hopes of scaring the baby out.

"Due to nationwide shortage of buzzy bee toys, New Plymouth sends Prime Minister actual bees
","The bees are reportedly “not calm, not calm at all.”
Sort-of-but-not-technically-husband to the Prime Minister Clarke Gayford has confirmed that he and Jacinda Ardern have received a “lovely” gift to the tune of some 600 live bees from the town of New Plymouth.
The bees were sent to the Prime Minister as a gift for the arrival of her baby, after Mayor Neil Holdom failed to acquire a buzzy bee toy.
There is a severe nationwide shortage of the toys, as most have been sold as gifts for the Prime Minister already.
Ardern and Clarke are now estimated to own roughly 80% of existing stock of buzzy bees.
“Obviously we wanted to get the Prime Minister a buzzy bee,” said Holdom. “But the upside to having to send them actual bees, is it could be a nice change of pace, and they can show their daughter the fake bees and the real bees and then discuss the differences, and that sort of thing.”
Gayford, taking a rare phone call from media this afternoon, said the bees were “great” but “presently uncontained.”
He urged anyone to contact him if they knew what to do with the bees, or how to “control them.”
It is presently unknown whether the Prime Minister is allergic to bees, and Mayor Holdom admits that’s “something I wish I’d known, actually, before I did this.”
Following this line of questioning, Holdom appeared nervous and abruptly ended the interview, saying he had to “make some phone calls.”

","Pregnant women all around Auckland are crossing their fingers and hoping to experience the great miracle of medical malpractice
Pregnant Auckland women due to give birth this weekend are excited at the possibility that their baby may be accidentally switched with the Prime Minister’s in a routine hospital mix-up.
The birth of Jacinda Ardern and Clarke Gayford’s first known child has raised an exciting opportunity for couples who conceived their children at roughly the same time as they did.
Roughly five babies a year are estimated to be switched at birth, and given to the wrong parents, and while that would usually be a horrific ordeal for parents, this weekend, it could be anything but.
The odds are slim, but very real that one lucky couple will lose their baby to the Prime Minister and receive a child with Prime Ministerial blood.
Jill McKinnon is due to give birth tomorrow, the same day as Ardern, and is very excited about the possibility.
“It’s a bit like winning the lotto, I suppose,” she grinned. “Unlikely to happen, I know, but just imagine!”
Other women spoken to with due dates in the same three-day range as the Prime Minister all said they’d be getting DNA tests as soon as they got home.

"Shortland Street special to depict the hospital scrambling to deliver Prime Minister’s baby
","PICTURED: A still from Monday night’s highly anticipated special
Beloved New Zealand soap opera and renowned hospital show, Shortland Street, will commemorate the birth of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s baby with a special, feature-length episode in which the eponymous hospital has to scramble to deliver the Prime Minister’s baby during a total blackout.
According to TVNZ, on Monday night, the hospital will face a challenge unlike any in its 26-year history.
Auckland is struck by a major blackout, cutting power to the entire city. The Shortland Street Hospital is without its back-up generator after anaethetist Luke Durville used all its remaining power making cheese toasted sandwiches after hours.
To make matters worse, the Prime Minister has gone into labour and the baby needs delivering imminently.
Executive producer Don Reynolds says the episode will be a central pillar in the show’s history, and Ardern will receive a DVD copy as a gift.
“We just think it’s a great way to mark this really special occasion. It’ll be especially great for Jacinda’s daughter and/or son to watch it back when they’re older, see the scene where they cause untold chaos and force the hospital to have to redirect its resources resulting the deaths of several less important patients, and think ‘Hey, that was me.'”
There was only one major obstacle to getting the epsiode cleared. In the Shortland Street universe, the Prime Minister is a man, the fictional Mr. John English, and having him give birth took “some suspension of disbelief.”
“That was, yeah, I mean, we didn’t think of that when wrote it, actually,” said Reynolds. “It’s just one of those things where our fictional universe didn’t quite line up with the real one, and we thought, ‘well, are we not going to do this just because our Prime Minister is a man?'”
Reynolds wouldn’t guarantee that English would survive the episode, hinting that the stakes would be high.
“It’s a very delicate situation. You have a hospital in darkness, minimal resources, and a Prime Minister who has to force a baby out his urethra.”",NaN,16/06/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shortlandstreetbabystory-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Opinion: Recent experiences have led me to believe that text voting would be a wonderful thing for our democracy
","By David Seymour
Hi.
I’m David. Hello.
You might know me by now, I’m on the TV occasionally, I pour my own beer in public, and I wear shirts that are handed to me. All good then.
Well you must be wondering, what do I stand for?
Anyway, I have some thoughts about our political system I’d like to share with you.
At the last election, nearly 45% of people voted for ACT (or National). That’s actually more than the number of people that voted for Labour and the Greens combined, that voted for us (or National).
Despite winning the election, we lost.
Well now I think that’s quite silly, and I think you would agree.
This prompted me to spend the last six months or so thinking about ways to make our democracy more fair, and a series of highly non-specific recent experiences have led me to believe that the best possible thing for elections in New Zealand, moving forward, would be something called text to vote.
I’m not sure where I first got this idea, that’s anybody’s guess, but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense.
As it stands, you can work hard, earn a living, get a promotion, stay up late adding value to our economy, buying a yacht, creating jobs for kiwi mums and dads and people who scoop plastic out of the oceans. But no matter how much you earn, no matter how much you sweat and toil, you only ever get one vote.
Just one. There are people out there who work far less hard than you, have fewer yachts, considerably less phone credit, and yet they have the same number of votes as you.
No matter how hard you work, you can’t get ahead.
Our current system of voting measures the quantity of support, but not the quality. 26 people who begrudgingly vote for Labour are worth the same as 26 people who passionately support the ACT Party.
Passion is important. I know, because I get scolded about it over and over again every Sunday and Monday night at 7pm and 7:30pm respectively.
It’s not just passion though.  It would make voting a lot more accessible, and would be likely to pick up the forgotten voters, the missing million, such as the 13-year-old libertarian high school student who texts “DAVID” to 3333 until they run out of their mother’s phone credit.
For years, we’ve been searching for a way to engage the youth, and all along, we could’ve done it for just 99c a text and standard charges may apply.
There’s another idea I came up with, something about a three person panel giving different parties scores out of ten and awarding seats based on that, but I’m still on the fence about that one.
I’ll tell you how I feel about it on Tuesday.",NaN,18/05/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/seymourdwtsstory-274x300.jpg,Fake
"BUDGET 2018: Labour to pass increased cost of health onto Mark Richardson
","Mark Richardson will be paying several thousand dollars extra in tax next year, in a move that Finance Minister Grant Robertson calls “unfortunate but necessary.”
In his first budget as Finance Minister, Grant Robertson announced today that the Labour Government will be passing a projected increase in cost of health services onto broadcaster and former cricketer Mark Richardson, citing a lack of willingness to take “a cut in our revenue.”
Starting next financial year, Richardson will be subjected to an exclusive tax on his income, in order to offset a small funding imbalance in health.
“If we weren’t to take this measure, the Government would be losing somewhere between five and six thousand dollars per annum,” said Robertson, in a live Q&A session on Facebook this afternoon. “This is essentially saying, we don’t want to absorb that cost, so if it’s going to cost more, we really have no choice but to pass it on.”
Robertson acknowledged that Richardson would not be happy with the decision.
“I know that Mark was really worried about this budget because his tax is about to go up. Sorry, fella,” he said.
Following those comments, Robertson reportedly received a text message from Richardson, asking if he were serious.
“I am serious about this,” said Robertson. “We’re not going to suffer because people are getting sick. We’re just going to have to hand that cost over. We’re running a Government here, you know.”
Richardson has publicly lashed out at the tax in a Facebook post this evening, in which he called it “unfair” because “I have nothing to do with this. I have nothing to do with this. You can’t pass the cost onto people who have less just because you face additional cost.”
He said it was “especially ridiculous” because “I have nothing to do with the increase in health spending. How can you charge me more for something I have nothing to do with?”
Richardson will raise rent on his tenants, and take back every dollar he ever gave his children in order to cover the cost of the new tax.

"Ardern’s baby to be sent to regions as part of coalition deal with NZ First
","The PM and Deputy PM confirm plans to send Ardern’s baby to the regions, while a sign language interpreter indicates the vague direction the newborn will be headed.
Regional Development Minister and leading suspect in the disappearance of the Glenfield Peaches & Cream DVD section Shane Jones, announced today that as part of a previously confidential clause in the Labour-New Zealand First coalition agreement, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s newly born baby will be shipped to the regions, just after it’s born next month.
Jones said the agreement was not specific to the Prime Minister’s first child, but was part of a broader agreement struck between the two parties.
“As part of our agreement, any baby born to the Prime Minister or any of my extramarital affairs or premarital affairs during the period of this term will be donated to New Zealand’s regional growth,” he said. “The regions have been long neglected, and are in dire need of fresh blood.”
“Oh,” he added. “And, uh, it says here also postmarital affairs.”
Jones would not disclose which region the baby would be shipped to, though it’s widely believed it may be shared on a month by month basis between several economically hard hit North Island provinces.
“Oh, and prostitutes,” he clarified, to silence and bemused looks. “I just uhh… have been instructed to clarify they don’t fall under affairs.”
Prime Minister Ardern and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters confirmed the plan at a Beehive press conference this afternoon, saying that Jones was “accurate” in his statements, and “not drunk this time.”
Ardern said the process of where exactly her first-born would be sent would “play itself out in time, I imagine,” but she and partner Clarke Gayford had been preparing the fetus by watching Country Calendar with it, and drinking “a lot of Tui.”
According to Peters, all workers in the selected region will receive six weeks of mandatory leave in order to spend time with the baby.
Ardern would still take maternity leave, and Peters would still take over as Acting Prime Minister during this period.
“Will Mr. Peters move into the ninth floor?” Ardern was asked.
“Oh, I think that would be an unnecessary inconvenience,” she laughed, turning to Peters.
“Not necessarily,” he replied.
Clarke Gayford will be allowed to accompany the baby to the regions, provided he throws out all his nice shirts and gets a first name.
*Shane Jones contacted us shortly after the publication of this story and wants to note that the coalition agreement doesn’t include already born children he is not currently aware of.

"Government to ban vodka in desperate attempt to look like it’s doing something about Russia
","Peters has repeatedly asked staff to investigate whether there are any Russian cigars.
Foreign Minister Winston Peters has held a press conference on very short notice this afternoon, to announce that the government will be seeking a blanket ban on vodka and related products.
The move is a transparent attempt to make the government look like it’s doing something about Russia, in the face of growing calls for it to act with the international community in response to a nerve agent attack in the United Kingdom.
Despite not having any ministerial authority in the area, Peters said the law would seek to ban all vodka products, beginning “immediately.”
“The fun is over,” announced Peters, dramatically, before stopping, to a prolonged silence.
“Are you going to say anymore?” asked Newshub political editor Lloyd Burr.
“Now listen here, sunshine,” said Peters, “I am not going to kowtow to the wishes of a media cabal that has no interest in hearing the facts. If you think I’m going to say anymore, then you’ve got another thing coming.”
The press conference was brought to a close, but a statement from the Deputy Prime Minister’s office was released an hour later, instructing all liquor retailers to pre-emptively halt the sale of vodka, and ship any bottles to the Foreign Minister’s office for “storage” and “testing.”
Retailers were also encouraged to ship bottles of whisky with the vodka, in order to provide “a control group.”
Asked for comment, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she knew “nothing” of Peters’ plan to ban vodka.
“That would not be his area of ministerial responsibility,” she nodded.
Asked if Peters’ declaration was government policy, she replied “It might be. I would have to gather the relevant information.”
“So do you have any idea what your minister is doing?” she was asked.
“As I said, I would have to gather the relevant information.”
“Do you have any control over any of your ministers at this point?”

"Cricket Australia bans all players not involved in cheating for ‘failing to uphold the standards of Australian cricket’
","Sutherland hopes the move will send a “strong message” to fans, kids, and the world, about what Australian Cricket is “really all about.”
Following the ball-tampering scandal that has rocked the cricket world, Cricket Australia today announced its sanctions on all players not involved with the plot to cheat in the third test against South Africa in Cape Town over the weekend.
The national cricket body has taken severe disciplinary action against the entire playing eleven from that test, with the exception of captain Steve Smith, David Warner, and Cameron Bancroft, who have been cleared of any right-doing.
Cricket Australia boss James Sutherland said he was “extremely disappointed” in those players who had “let down their country” and behaved in a way that was “truly un-Australian.”
“The public is obviously disappointed in these [eight] players, as well as any and all coach staff that were not aware of this incident,” he said. “This is not what we do, this is not how we behave, and these sanctions make that very, very clear.”
All players who were not involved with the plot to bring sandpaper onto the field in an attempt to gain an illegal advantage, have been issued with one year bans from the sport, with the exception of fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, who did not explicitly endorse the plan, but, “to their credit as Australian sportsmen” did not explicitly reject it, either. They have been issued with six month bans.
Before these players will be considered again for national selection by Australia, they must complete up to 100 hours of cheating in Australian grade or state cricket.

"Preliminary census results show that Russian spies only make up 1.3% of New Zealand population
","The number of Russian spies in New Zealand isn’t even as high as the population of Palmerston North.
Some vindication for the Prime Minister and her foreign minister today, as leaked census data shows that the number of Russian spies in New Zealand is relatively small, as compared to the general population.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, along with Foreign Minister Winston Peters, have been under fire this week for failing to follow the lead of the UK, the United States, and Australia in expelling suspected Russian spies from their countries.
But Ardern insists there isn’t anyone to expel, and that either there are no foreign agents who fit the profile of a Russian spy, or that their presence is negligible.
“We do not have any undeclared intelligence officers in New Zealand,” she told media today, adding: “That does not mean New Zealand is not subject to Russian agents who secretly monitor us and divulge our most sensitive national secrets to the Russian government. I must make that distinction.”
While such assurances have been scoffed at by the Opposition, 2018 preliminary census data, awkwardly leaked to the media today in a humiliating fashion by a man wearing fake facial hair and glasses who tripped over himself and was quite transparently Statistics Minister James Shaw but insisted his name was “a different James”, reveals that Russian spies make up only a very small portion of our roughly five million population.
According to the census data, which was gathered earlier in March but is not yet finalised, there are roughly 62,400 Russian spies in New Zealand, just 1.3% of the population.
“It’s tiny!” roared Peters in Parliament this afternoon, hiffing the leaked numbers onto the floor in the direction of the Opposition. “It’s nonsense. There are more South Africans in New Zealand than Russian intelligence officials, and nearly as many Samoans.
“People in the Five Eyes have consulted with us on our decision, understand our decision, and did so before the decision was made,” he said, before being quietly whispered to by the Prime Minister. “Correction: after the decision was made.”
National Party leader Semen Bridgov has been relatively quiet since the leak, but did say he’d like to see the statistics once “officially released”, and did not put a lot a whole lot of weight on them “когда они стоят.”

"Black Caps accused of score tampering using foreign objects Wagner, Watling, Raval and de Grandhomme
","PICTURED: Camera footage of one of the several foreign objects present on the field throughout the first test.
The Black Caps’ famous test win over England in Auckland has been marred today, by accusations that skipper Kane Williamson introduced a series of foreign objects to the field in order to tamper with the score.
Cameras at Eden Park caught what appeared to be four distinct objects being used to bat, bowl, field, and otherwise change the score in a variety of ways, seemingly right under the nose of the captain.
Those objects included South African-born Neil Wagner, South African-born BJ Watling, Indian-born Jeet Raval, and Zimbabwean-born Colin The Big Homes*.
At a hastily arranged press conference today, Williamson acknowledged the presence of the objects, and admitted to being aware of their use.
He conceded that foreign objects “were introduced,” and that they were “doing things.”
“What kind of things?” he was asked.
“Oh, uhh, various things,” he nodded, sullenly.
“The decision was made in the dressing room, uh, prior to the uh, match, that we would use four foreign objects in order to attempt to gain an advantage in the game.
“I’m not exactly proud of it, but it’s what happened, and I can promise you, it’ll happen many more times under my leadership.”
Williamson says the call was not his alone, and was made by the “whole leadership group.”
But both privately and publicly, a rift is emerging within the team, with other New Zealand players saying they had “no idea” about the tactic.
Swing bowler Tim Southee said he was “completely blindsided” by the revelation that any of the four foreign-born players were on the field, saying he hadn’t noticed them at any point.
Asked how many people were in a cricket team, Southee replied “Ele– uh, seven.”
Coach Mike Hesson also denies involvement.
“I don’t know who any of those people are,” said Hesson, when confronted with the names of the objects. “I’ve certainly never seen that one in my life,” he remarked, pointing to a picture of de Grandhomme. “I mean that’s clearly not a real person.”
On the back of growing public anger, New Zealand Cricket is investigating the incident, not ruling out punishing Kane Williamson by never allowing him to shave again.
The scandal comes in the wake of accusations from earlier in the test that England brought sandpaper onto the field in order to sand down Craig Overton’s head into something more aerodynamic.

"Sky’s new starter package just a cable in a box
","Sky chief John Fellett says customers shouldn’t expect “too much” from such a cheap package.
Sky’s new starter package has disappointed some new subscribers, who have described the service as “just a cable in a box.”
In an attempt to attract new customers, and slow the steady decline of its subscription base, New Zealand’s national satellite TV provider has offered a much cheaper entry package to the service, one that allows customers to buy a cable – an essential part of the Sky TV experience – for just $24.91 a month.
The option allows customers who felt like they didn’t want to commit to a full basic package – which contains the Sky box necessary to make the service to actually function – to purchase it on a much tighter budget.
Sky chief executive and original witness to the Great Chicago Fire, John Fellett, said he felt customers who found themselves unable to afford the full Sky package would “really enjoy the cable.”
“For just under $25 a month, you can come home, sit the family down around the living room, stare at the cable sitting in the middle of your floor, and dream of what it might be like to afford Sky proper,” he said.
Alice Nuthall, 33, said she and her husband were excited to be able to finally become Sky subscribers, but were taken aback when all they received for their fixed six month contract was a cable that “didn’t appear to connect to anything.”
“Honestly, I don’t know what we expected,” she said, glancing, forlorn, at her useless wire.
John Egan, 27, was significantly less disappointed.
“It’s alright, aye?” he said, casually tossing the cable across his living room, onto the floor. “Yeah, goes fine, I guess.”

"National hopes Simon Bridges will broaden its appeal to other young, Māori former Cabinet ministers
","In 2018, identity politics is everything, as National scrambles to appeal to former head boys with a keen interest in electric vehicles.
In its embrace of what has come to be known as a “generational shift,” the opposition National Party hopes that its election of Simon Bridges as leader will help attract voters who, like Bridges, are young, Māori and former Cabinet ministers with wide experience across a range of portfolios.
“I hope young Māori former Cabinet ministers are proud of me,” said Bridges, when asked about his heritage at his first press conference on Tuesday, “that the National Party has elected its first young, Māori former Cabinet minister with a background in law.
“I hope young, Māori former Cabinet ministers with a background in law and a fear of static electricity – who traditionally have been with NZ First at times, Labour – will give us a second look and think about us and what we mean: the opportunities that we present for young, Māori former Cabinet ministers with a background in law, a fear of static electricity and own a Peugeot.”
Bridges said he believed Māoridom was changing.
“I think clearly we are seeing young Māori former Cabinet ministers with a background in law, a fear of static electricity, who own a Peugeot, and don’t consider their Māoridom to be a prominent part of their background succeed in business, both small and large, and they are as aspirational as every other New Zealander.”
No National MP would go on record to make a prediction, but some were cautiously optimistic Bridges would make “significant inroads” with the people he was speaking to in that answer.
University of Otago politics lecturer and political commentator, Bryce Edwards, said that while National’s choice wasn’t driven by identity politics, the chance to appeal to young, Māori former Cabinet ministers with a background in law, a fear of static electricity, who own a Peugeot, don’t consider their Māoridom to be a prominent part of their background and have a white wife called Natalie was a conscious by-product of the decision.
“People vote for people who look and sound like them,” said Edwards. “The number of young voters that vote for you is determined by how young you are.”
Edwards said he expected “most” young, Māori former Cabinet ministers with a background in law, a fear of static electricity, who own a Peugeot, don’t consider their Māoridom to be a prominent part of their background, have a white wife called Natalie and attend an Anglican church to vote for National.

","And if thou gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.
Jeremy Wells, co-host of Seven Sharp and Hauraki’s 3 hour morning sex advice segment, is finding it increasingly hard to sleep, as the ghost of Mike Hosking continually reappears in his bathroom.
Friends of Wells say he has yet to determine whether the apparition lives in the bathroom itself, or whether it actually exists within the confines of his soul, manifesting itself in his most private moments.
The broadcaster’s first brush with the ghost of his predecessor came the morning after his first night hosting TV One’s flagship current affairs show. Wells briefly looked up to the mirror while brushing his teeth, and for a split second swore he could’ve seen Hosking scrubbing away in his place.
Friends say what he initially wrote off as a vague, split-second hallucination appeared to be something more when he had another encounter during a bath the following night.
As he slipped into his bath on the Wednesday evening, he was met with Hosking bathing directly opposite him, their lower legs overlapping in a knowing, almost familial way.
Hosking took a sip from a large glass of pinot noir and stared into the depths of Jeremy’s eyes.
“Goodness me,” Wells recalls having said calmly, before stepping out of the bath to see Hosking had vanished.
Things escalated further this week when Wells showed up to TVNZ studios wearing a slightly tattered pair of jeans worn out at the knees, and even further on Thursday night when he appeared on the show in an eccentric, asymmetrical blazer.
“Interesting outfit,” remarked co-host Hilary Barry as they went to air.

"Oil from Simon Bridges’ hair causes horrific spill in Oriental Bay
","PICTURED: Crude oil from Simon Bridges’ scalp fills Wellington’s harbour.
A state of emergency has been declared in Wellington this morning, after a leak in the hairline of National Party leadership contender Simon Bridges resulted in a spillage of close to fifty tonnes of crude oil into Oriental Bay and the surrounding harbour region.
Preliminary assessments have blamed the spill on a structural fault in Bridges’ hairline, but some witness accounts now suggest there may have been undue tampering with the MP’s hair just prior to the incident.
Bridges is said to have been out and about on the Wellington waterfront today, meeting voters who will play a crucial lack of any role in deciding whether he becomes his party’s leader in the weeks ahead.
One witness, who wished to be identified by name but really shouldn’t be so greedy, said he or she saw a young woman request to touch Bridges’ wet mop.
Bridges told her no, and recoiled when she repeatedly attempted to anyway.
The witness believes she got a hand to Bridges’ hair on numerous occasions, potentially with enough force to have caused a rupture.
Maritime New Zealand is working with Wellington’s regional council to develop a plan to contain and eventually clean up the spill, but Bridges himself has yet to be located. There are growing fears he has already been washed far from shore, and is continuing to spill oil into the environment.
A spokesperson for Maritime NZ said it was “paramount” that the MP was found “as quickly as possible”, as it is unknown at this time just how many tonnes of crude oil is contained beneath his hair’s gelatinous surface.
The bay’s wildlife has already been mercilessly coated in the oil from Bridges’ head, including Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard, who was forced to come ashore after diving into a thick black pocket several hours ago.
Many good natured Wellingtonians have taken time off work this afternoon to make their way down to the beach, in an effort to help clean the oil off Mallard, though it is believed the process could take weeks.
Bridges’ leadership rival, Judith Collins, is angry about the spill, accusing him of doing it deliberately in order to gain the support of MPs from her faction of the party.",NaN,16/02/18,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/simonbridgeshairspillfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Winston Peters said nothing in talks with National, just walked around room with a box cutter

Details have emerged of yesterday’s preliminary coalition meeting between National and New Zealand First, with confirmed reports that Winston Peters did not utter a word during the thirty minute meeting, to which he arrived late.
As Prime Minister Bill English – accompanied by Gerry Brownlee and Steven Joyce – sat in silence, waiting for Peters to open negotiations, he instead slowly rifled through several draws in the room, looking for an object that turned out to be a small box cutter.
Peters is said to have extended the box cutter, and silently circled the National negotiating team, as English awkwardly pleaded with him.
“Look, ultimately, you have to ask yourself – uh, you, uh, you have to ask yourself,” English stammered, recoiling as Peters moved nearer. “You have to ask, do I really want – I mean, what you want is strong, s-stable…”
The negotiating team went increasingly silent as Peters donned a pair of black overalls, before suddenly and violently slitting the throat of his own chief of staff, David Broome.
Peters reportedly opened Broome’s gaping wound to spray blood in the direction of National’s team, staining their clothes and sprinkling their faces.

"Skirting the law: Was it legal for Jacinda Ardern to walk around malls all day wearing a bag over her head?
","This woman, identified as Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, spent today walking around Auckland malls shaking people’s hands and picking up their children.
The Electoral Commission says it’s investigating complaints that Labour leader Jacinda Ardern spent most of election day walking around malls, meeting supporters and shaking hands.

"Grant Robertson breaking into people’s homes screaming ‘let’s do this’ in last ditch election eve effort
","Do not go gently into that goodnight. Rage, rage, against the closing of the campaign window.
Political parties are leaving no stone unturned tonight as they aggressively campaign for every last vote.
Campaigning and other indications of political support will become illegal at midnight, until polls close tomorrow at 7pm. But given the hotly contested nature of this particular election, politicians are using every last minute.
Labour’s Grant Robertson has taken advantage of a quiet night in for most New Zealanders, breaking into their living rooms through the window as they watch television.
“LET’S DO THIS!” he has reportedly been screaming as he fumbles his way through their curtains and knocks over their fine china. “LET’S FUCKING DO THIS!”
There is as yet no word on whether leader Jacinda Ardern or the party at large has signed off on this strategy, or whether it was Grant’s idea, nor how much alcohol was involved in its conception.
But in a phone interview just minutes ago, Robertson did say “Ahhhhhh’ll fuckin’ do this myself.”
The sounds of beer bottle caps rattled in the background.
But Labour isn’t the only party making last minute election moves. Greens sole-leader James Shaw has been sitting at a Wellington bus stop crying, and passers-by say it has made him seem “more sympathetic.”
“When he vomited all over the pavement, I really saw myself in that,” said one young woman.

"David Seymour spent final day of campaign standing next to stack of his books saying ‘Hey, check these out’
","The ACT Party leader had a relatively muted final day of the campaign.
ACT Party leader David Seymour spent his final day of the campaign standing in a local Whitcoulls, next to a stack of his own new book, Own Your Future.
Seymour, who is not allowed to say the words “ACT Party” in his electorate of Epsom, or to his family, awkwardly waved at customers as they passed by his books.
“Hey,” he would say awkwardly, before pausing for five seconds, and then saying “Check these out.”
“It’s a good read,” he told one elderly woman.
“No? Okay.”
Seymour says he has sold one whole book today, to a man who later returned it.

"Farmers blame absence of Bill English for failure to summon Cow God
","Farmers were deeply disappointed when an incantation meant to summon the Cow God instead summoned Winston Peters.
Dairy farmers have spent the better part of today blaming Prime Minister Bill English for their failure to summon the Cow God beneath the Morrinsville Mega Cow at a protest yesterday.
Farmers assembled beneath the cow and chanted “Delivering for New Zealanders” in hopes of summoning the God of all cows, who is prophesied by Country Calendar to arrive in farmers’ time of need, to stop a two cent charge on every thousand litres of water being introduced by a Labour Government.
But the Cow God failed to materialise, as the protestors instead accidentally summoned Winston Peters. This was met with great disappointment, booing, and jeering.
“This is not a political rally,” began Winston as he was summoned beneath the Mega Cow.
“YES IT IS!” screamed one farmer, holding a two ticks blue sign.
“Fuck off!” yelled another.
Armed with a megaphone, Winston continued speaking, attempting to laugh off the dissent as one of his candidates was mowed down by a tractor.
Organiser Lloyd Downing blamed the failure to summon the Cow God on the absence of Prime Minister Bill English, who was one of the three relics required to wake the milkiest one from her otherwise eternal slumber.
“I’ll tell you what, mate,” he said. “The way it’s foretold is, you need three things to summon her, the almighty Cow God: Myrtle the tractor, a sexist sign about a Labour leader, and Bill English. Preferably the last holding the second while riding the first, but I’m told the details don’t matter all that much.
“Which is why I thought we might have a shot even without him. We had two out of three. But no, turns out if you just have the sign and the tractor, you summon Winston Peters instead.”
Downing said he believed just the tractor and Bill English would summon the ghost of Barry Crump, while just the sign and Bill English would summon Don Brash. Only all three would summon the Cow God.
“We’re frankly disappointed he didn’t show,” he said. “It was quite successful the last time.”
The Cow God has only been successfully summoned once before, in 2003, when Bill English held up a sexist sign about a Labour leader while riding Myrtle the tractor outside Parliament.
The Cow God enslaved the human populace, clipped their ears and milked them for five years until they agreed to elect John Key.",NaN,19/09/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/megacowstory-300x200.jpg,Fake
"Bill English will early vote for himself tomorrow morning before he changes his mind
","National has already been trying to get Steven Joyce and Simon O’Connor to vote early, both of whom have assured the party they’ll vote on election day and “it’ll be fine.”
Prime Minister Bill English has announced late this afternoon that he will be following the lead of Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, and breaking tradition by casting an early vote.
English says he plans to vote tomorrow morning, before he changes his mind.
“Look, I think what you’ve seen is a real competition between the main two parties. A drag race, if you will. Every vote counts, and we want every potential National voter locked in,” he said. “That includes me.”
The Prime Minister said he “wasn’t necessarily” saying he wasn’t going to vote for his party.
“So right now, at the moment, I’m inclined to vote National,” he said. “That might change, it might not, but I owe it to myself to get myself into a polling place as early as possible, and say ‘right, that’s it, you’ve done that, no more worrying about it now. The time has passed.’”
He acknowledged it was “problematic” that his democratic right to vote had “a certain conflict of interest” with his job.
English’s wife, Mary English, said the next fifteen or so hours would be the most difficult.
“There is a sense that time is running out,” she said. “He’ll want to get to bed as early as possible, and not wake up until the polls open again.”
She expected the dinner table to be “especially tense.”
“He’s been afraid one of us is going to say something and it’s going to flick a switch in his brain.”
Mary said Bill had been watching back his debates against Jacinda Ardern, and had found her to be “much more convincing.”
“It wasn’t good, so he switched over the debates from his first campaign, but that was even worse. He couldn’t tell which one was him.”
Nevertheless, English is determined to vote for himself this time around, after famously caving and voting for Helen Clark’s Labour Government when he last led National in 2002.",NaN,12/09/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/billenglishvoteselffeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Steven Joyce reminds journalists that everyone said Copernicus was wrong, too
","Steven Joyce is confident he’ll be vindicated by the passage of time.
Faced with economists left and right dismissing his claim that there is an $11.7 billion hole in the Labour Party’s pre-election fiscal plan, Finance Minister Steven Joyce continues to double down this evening, holding an impromptu press conference to teach journalists about Nicolaus Copernicus.
“Now, some of you may have done history,” he began. “I didn’t. But you know, here goes something.”
Joyce brought along a large presentation in the form of A1 sheets of paper, and a pointing stick.
“This,” he said, pointing to a picture of the globe, “is the Earth. That’s the thing we’re on. It’s like a big, round, rock kind of thing, as some of you know, some of you might’ve done geology. I didn’t.”
“This, we know today that this,” he paused to turn to the next sheet, a picture of the sun, “goes around this.”
“In fact,” he added, tracing a circle around the sun, “it goes around it like this, in a big circle. Why? I don’t know. It’s a mystery. But! Aha, and here’s the thing: we didn’t always know this.”
Joyce proceeded to tell the story of Nicolaus Copernicus, who was one of the first to propose the model of the Earth revolving around the sun, as opposed to the sun revolving around the Earth; a theory met with near unanimous disagreement by his peers at the time.
“The point is,” concluded Joyce, now having gone through fourteen sheets, some of which he insisted he had no idea how they got in there, “that just because absolutely everyone says I’m wrong, does not mean I am wrong.
“I don’t know how many of you did philosophy? I didn’t. But you get the point.”
Asked whether he could really be compared to one of history’s most influential thinkers, Joyce replied “Of course. It just happened.”
“With all due to respect, Steven,” interjected Newshub political editor Patrick Gower. “Copernicus died before anyone really believed him. I mean what are you saying here?”
“Well, I’m saying just that, Paddy,” said Joyce. “It might take some time, but in hundreds of years, people will look back and say ‘Gosh, Steven Joyce was right about the shortfall in operating expenditure.’”
“Any more questions?” he asked, faced with a now silent pack of journalists.
Barry Soper raised his hand.
“No, Barry, I’ve already explained the picture from my wedding night, I really can’t say anymore about that.”
Since this evening’s press conference, eight independent historians contacted by media have said Joyce is wrong, and that he is “not like Copernicus.”
The only dissenting voice comes from the Taxpayer’s Union, whose employed historian says Joyce is “absolutely the same.”",NaN,06/09/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/joycecopernicusfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Nation deeply divided over whether to put expected operating spending in categorised expenses row or operation allowances row
","If you thought the election couldn’t get any more exciting, it didn’t.
The most exciting New Zealand election of the modern era may have become even more explosive today, after Finance Minister Steven Joyce attacked Labour for putting forecast health and education operating spending for 2018/19 and 2019/20 in their respective expense figures, while including only unannounced new initiatives under the category “operating allowances.”
The truly stunning accusations have lit a fire underneath an already polarising race, and raised the eyebrows of every voter over 60 with more than ten years experience as a chartered accountant.
Steven Joyce says the accounting practice not typically used by Treasury but apparently approved by Business and Economic Research Limited suggests either a $12 billion shortfall, or, if not, a significant underfunding of operational allowance for new miscellaneous Government initiatives over a three year period spanning financial years 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20, and even 2020/21.
Joyce says you “simply cannot spend only [that type of money] on [stuff].”
“As you know, one of our long-standing criticisms of the opposition is that they don’t spend enough money,” he added.
But Labour’s finance spokesperson and man responsible for writing the party’s budget, Grant Robertson, has hit back, saying National have failed, in their own costings, to account for population growth, inflation, and other factors when forecasting future operating expenditure, and that the inclusion of already announced spending in expenditure categories as opposed to operational allowance reflected Labour’s fiscal prudence and foresight on budgetary matters.
Voters all around the country are reacting strongly to today’s exchange.
“What?” asked Dylan Holland, of Papatoetoe. “I’m sorry, what?”
Economists we spoke to this evening told us “[numbers]” and “[things].”

"Labour’s new tax calculator lets you put in your income and creates a working group that will deliberate for two years on what you’ll pay
","Labour’s finance spokesperson says the party has been “very clear” on how they’ll prospectively think about introducing various kinds of potential taxes at an undetermined point in the future.
In an effort to help reassure voters about its tax plans, Labour has introduced a new tax calculator on its website that will help to clarify what New Zealanders will pay if it wins the election on September 23rd.
The calculator lets you put in your income and assets, or those of your whole family, if you wish. You then click a button labelled “calculate”, which will form a working group that will deliberate for two years on what you should pay.
Providing your email and home address will allow the working group to get back to you with a full report in 18-24 months.
Kiwis are loving the new tool.
Kirsty Jordan, of Wellington, said it gave her excellent peace of mind to know that “something is happening.”
“I have no idea what’s happening,” she said. “But something is.”
If you choose to use an advanced version of the tool, Labour even lets you build your very own working group, selecting experts from a range of fields to produce just the right long-term professional tax advice for you.
National, for their part, are said to be working on their own tax calculator, which lets you put in your income, and tells you how much more you’ll make if you get a better job.",NaN,01/09/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/labourtaxcalcfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"The Great Hosking Debate: A Debrief
","The Civilian breaks down tonight’s TVNZ leaders debate starring Mike Hosking.
TVNZ’s Great Hosking Debate between Mike Hosking and some lady and some man really lived up to its billing tonight, producing all the thrills and spills we’re used to seeing from the network that brought us “The News.”
Bill English spent the day indoors with his debate coach practicing the time-tested phrase “The only poll that matters is the one on election day”, while Jacinda Ardern spent the day with a working group that has spent the last several years producing a detailed report on what she should say tonight.
In the end, it determined she should propose a working group.
The debate looked like it might get off to a chaotic start as Winston Peters attempted to force his way on the stage with a makeshift podium he appeared to have made from Northland-sourced sticks.
Viewers tuning in at the very start could hear Peters yelling loudly about a “sham” and a “shake-down” as he was dragged out of the studio.
What followed was a dazzling sixty minute assault on our democracy.
These are just some of the highlights:
Ardern closed the debate on a positive note, reinforcing her theme of “relentless positivity” by saying she agreed with “everything Bill said.”
English, on the other hand, had his most relatable moment of the night, reminding all of us of high school when he was forced to read his closing statement off a piece of paper handed to him by his mum.
As the debate over who won the debate raged on social media, The Civilian conducted its own scientific Twitter poll, with the following results:

"Hosking to be replaced in leaders debates by Jim Hickey, who will ask questions exclusively about the weather
","Tonight’s debate, which was set to see Jacinda Ardern go head-to-head with Mike Hosking, will now see her take on Bill English over the issue of today’s high in Dargaville.
In an eleventh-hour turnaround, TVNZ has reneged on its promise to keep Mike Hosking on as the host of its leadership debates, caving to public pressure with less than two hours to go until the first one.
Head of News John Gillespie said he simply “couldn’t go through” with letting Hosking host the debates, after discovering his prepared cue cards were just “lists of different labels of red wine.”
“That was the last straw, really,” he said. “Only 40% of the debate is supposed to be about red wine.”
Gillespie said that with a change of host, tonight’s debate would take a change of tone, and of substance, as well.
It is now to be hosted by veteran weather presenter Jim Hickey, who is coming out of retirement just for tonight.
Hickey will moderate an hour-long discussion between Prime Minister Bill English and Labour leader Jacinda Ardern, featuring questions exclusively about the weather.
“One of the reasons we know people watch the 6pm news in the evening is the weather,” said Gillespie. “That’s why we tease it at the start, and continue doing so throughout, right up until the end. The news is really just one big build-up to the weather. People can’t keep get enough of it. They really just want to know what the weather is like where they are now.
“If we put it on at the start, people would just switch off afterwards. There’d be no point.
“So when we asked ourselves, do we want this debate to be about the issues that really matter to New Zealanders, and if we do, what are those issues, we came back with only one answer: the weather.”
Hickey’s debate questions are said to include inquiries about the levels of dew that accumulate on English and Ardern’s berms in the morning, and “what does this cloud look like to you?”
English is expected to play to his strengths, talking about how he likes to feel a light cool breeze on his upper shins, while Ardern will likely express her vision for applying sunscreen, even on a cloudy day.

"National promises ambitious new expressway between South Auckland and prison
","The expressway is just one of National’s announced Roads of National Significance (CLICK TO ENLARGE.)
Prime Minister Bill English has announced an ambitious multi-billion dollar expressway to be constructed between South Auckland and Auckland Prison, also passing by Mount Eden Corrections Facility.
English says the expressway will allow more rapid transit for an ever increasing number of criminals making a one-way commute to their confinement.
“Auckland, as I think you know, is very large,” said English. “It’s so large that you can’t actually drive around it. It takes up more or less the whole island.
“I think anybody who has experienced a wait in Auckland traffic can also sympathise with how frustrating that can be, and how long it can take to drive to the nearest corrections facility.
“There’s a lot of sitting and waiting, and the only movement tends to be incremental.
“So what are you going to do when you’re driving a corrections vehicle from South Auckland to Mount Eden, and end up in a situation where your prisoners just get out at the lights and run into the dairy or something?”
“Nothing,” interjected deputy Prime Minister Paula Bennett, shaking her head. “There’s nothing you can do.”
“That’s why we’re pledging an initial investment of $4 billion to construct a fast-moving expressway that will cut the average trip to prison by 10 minutes for one of our nation’s poorest communities,” said the Prime Minister.
He clapped, then stopped clapping to ask Bennett to also clap, then continued to clap.
English said National would also be looking into other potential technological solutions to prisoners escaping corrections vehicles, including handcuffing them, and locking the doors.
The South Auckland to Prison Expressway will have eight lanes, and be littered with land mines to discourage disembarking or stopping on the side of the road.

"Can it get any worse? Now James Shaw can’t get his hand out of the garbage disposal
","James Shaw is a mess.
Just when you thought things couldn’t get any worse for the Greens, it’s happened again.
Fortunes have gone from bad to worse for the previously ascendant party, after Metiria Turei’s benefit scandal spiralled further and further out of control, ultimately resulting in her resignation, and a collapse in opinion polling.
Co-leader James Shaw was left to lead the party by himself through to the election.
But now his own leadership is under threat, as he presently can’t get his hand out of his home garbage disposal unit.
“Look, guys, I was just… I was just trying to, god, I was just trying to crush some eggs, okay?” he said, speaking to media in underwear from his kitchen.
“I just, god, ugh,” he grunted, pulling on his arm with his free hand, “I just really don’t need this right now, okay? Honestly, I need a break.”
Asked how exactly his hand became so firmly wedged inside the unit, Shaw said he was trying to retrieve a small spoon from the mechanism.
He wasn’t discovered until this afternoon, and has been standing at the kitchen sink for nearly twelve hours.
Shaw says he has only cried “twice.”
The sole remaining co-leader of the Greens says he’s confident he will eventually free himself from the mechanism, but political commentators are saying it might be too late.
Serious questions are swirling around Shaw’s leadership, and whether he still has the practical or moral authority to lead the party.
“Make no mistake, this is very bad for James Shaw,” said Newshub political editor Patrick Gower on this evening’s broadcast. “With one co-leader gone, and another trapped in his kitchen, the Greens are in serious trouble tonight. This situation is nuclear.
A lot of Green supporters won’t want to hear this, but let me tell you this now: a man simply cannot lead a party with his hand stuck in a food disposal mechanism. It’s a disaster. He’s got to go.”
Gower said a Newshub-Reid Research poll, asking whether or not Shaw was “stupid” to get his hand stuck in his own sink, would be forthcoming.
But some commentators think the timing may be a blessing in disguise for Shaw.
“Really, the Greens are going to have to photoshop a lot of their current billboards anyway, what with Metiria leaving,” said Morgan Godfrey. “I really don’t see any reason they can’t just add the garbage disposal unit while they’re at it.”",NaN,10/08/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jamesisamessfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Did Andrew Little entertain hundreds of kids’ stupid bullshit for nothing?
","The former leader fears yes.
Former Labour leader but still a massive fixture in our election coverage for budgeting and scheduling reasons Andrew Little, has opened up about his resignation today, saying he’s primarily concerned that he may have entertained the “trivial bullshit” of hundreds of children for absolutely nothing.
Asked what his biggest regret as Labour leader was, Little unequivocally said it was listening to children “yammer on” about their “totally uninteresting” days and show him “terrible drawings” of “short men.”
“Why did they keep telling them Mr. Little was coming?” he groaned. “I’ll never understand, just call me Andrew. It’ll save the crying when they find out I’m not small.”
Little was once assaulted with a pencil by a 5-year-old girl who was reportedly “incensed” that he wasn’t “the real Mr. Little.”
He is said to have cried in the hallway afterwards.
In one particularly humiliating incident at a Rotorua school, Little was forced to watch a child for five whole minutes as he drew his “favourite Pry Minster” Bill English.
“I think that was the day I yelled at my junior publicist,” he said. “Why the fuck are you sending me to these places? These children can’t even vote. Why do we even talk to kids? Can’t we just ignore them?”
Now he feels – having resigned the leadership – these traumatic experiences may have been for nothing
“They do stick with you,” he said. “In bed, at night, the kid who asked you where your hair went, the kid who got snot on your brand new suit, the kid who drew a picture of you shitting on a seagull – I mean why on earth you’d ever do that.
“But you tell yourself, this is just part of the process, these are the hard yards, this is what you have to do to be Prime Minister.
“Well…”
Asked if he felt it might have been a character-building or an enriching experience meeting the nation’s children, Little just shook his head and looked at the floor.
“No,” he said. “No.”
“Any of it? Any part of the leadership?”
There was silence, and he took another hit.",NaN,03/08/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kidsstupidbullshitfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Gareth Morgan promises a TOP coalition would raise Jacinda Ardern’s kids for her
","A Gareth Morgan is a sort of polite harbinger of death that many believe heralds the end times.
In a bold campaign move this evening, Gareth Morgan has offered a helping hand to Jacinda Ardern, saying he’ll settle the question of her having children while Prime Minister once and for all.
The Opportunities Party leader says that any Labour-led coalition that includes his party will benefit from Morgan and his deputy leader Geoff Simmons personally taking care of any children Ardern might have.
“Yep, we’ll raise them,” said Morgan, at a hastily arranged press conference in his garage. “Straight from the womb. We’ve got a couple women on our list who could be surrogate mothers, too, if she likes. No time off required. We’ll just handle it all.”
“I always pride myself in thinking about the future,” he added, “and this is one of those issues that I think kiwis know we’re going to have to address, sooner or later, so why not just nip it in the bud now?”
Morgan said any coalition his party was part of would be negotiated on the condition of the establishment of a “Ministry for Jacinda Ardern’s Children.”
The Ministry would spend time raising the children, providing them with a universal basic income, and would make sure they had a full understanding of TOP’s tax policy by age 45.
All this, Morgan said, while “mummy gets to go to work.”
Simmons wanted to note that he and Morgan were so “future focused” they had already considered what the children’s names might be.
“We’re thinking Gareth Junior,” he said. “Or, for a girl, Garethrella.”
Morgan did not feel that any of this was condescending, as it was more about him being “a pointy-head who has all the ideas.”
“Look, I’m an ideas guy,” he said. “I’m the one who has ideas, so I just thought she might need some help with that.”
He added that he was actually a “great parent” because “my son made TradeMe.”

"How is Labour going to get this Andrew Little advertisement off the surface of the moon in time for election day?
","The moon – also known as the big cheese – is like a second Earth but with nothing on it.
Jacinda Ardern’s rise to the Labour leadership yesterday was widely perceived as necessary within the party, but changing leaders less than two months out from an election can come with it some unusual consequences and major headaches.
Not least of all: what Labour is going to do about the enormous advertisement they purchased on the surface of the moon.
The advertisement, which covers a significant portion of the lunar landscape, was intended to leave a lasting impression on voters, particularly those who viewed it through a telescope.
Ardern, appearing on Duncan Garner’s AM Show this morning, conceded it was one of the things “we’ve really got to think about now.”
“How much did that cost?” asked Garner. “That surely mustn’t have been cheap.”
“Uh, look, uh, you know, I don’t really want to tell you,” she said. “Our budgeting is our own internal business.”
“Surely this was a mistake, though?”
“Well, as you know Duncan, I’ve had less than 24 hours in the job, so I think people would understand if I just took the next 72 hours to take stock, and just take a step back and say ‘Okay, holy fuck, there’s a giant ad on the moon.’”
Labour MP Stuart Nash told media today the reason he was so opposed to leadership change this week was mostly to do with “the moon ad.”
“Obviously the fucking moon ad,” he said. “It took us months to get that up there. A man died.”
Nash said the party would be paying off the advertisement “for years,” and essentially left them without the money to replace any other advertising.
“It’s a disaster, and it’s even worse for Andrew,” he said. “He often deals with difficult times by taking a walk at night and looking up at the moon. How do you think he feels now?”
Not all may be lost, however. If this and other advertisement cannot be removed in time, Ardern said she would consider getting cosmetic surgery to look more like Andrew Little.",NaN,02/08/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/surfaceofmoonfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Introducing The Civilian’s Election Special: How Will You Vote Will You Vote At All Will You Even Consider Voting for Gareth You Probably Shouldn’t – Part One
","We paid someone $780 for this.
After three years of being forced to go about our regular lives, the election is finally here. And boy, what a start. Yes, you all know what we’re talking about: Bill English reminiscing about his English literature degree in Wellington tonight was a real hit with the voters. Is that where he got his last name? You have to wonder.
Tonight, The Civilian kicks into election gear with our Election Special, which is really just like the regular Civilian but with lots of election articles all the time that make you never want to hear about politics ever again.
We call it The Civilian Election Special: How Will You Vote Will You Vote At All Will You Even Consider Voting for Gareth You Probably Shouldn’t – Part One.
Or Part 1. Some people like to write numbers, some people don’t. Where do you stand? Where do the parties stand?
But don’t worry, we’ll tell you all that and more. You don’t even need to think. Unlike other news organisations, our coverage won’t beat around the bush and ask you to do the hard work of deciding how you feel about something.
In this modern age of technology, why use valuable brain power to decide how to vote, when a series of poorly photoshopped news graphics can do it for you?
That’s why we’d like to introduce our state of the art election tracker, which we’ll be updating at least five times a week throughout the campaign.
We should note that we made all of this in advance and at this point we simply don’t have the time or money to remove Andrew Little from any of our graphics, so we’re just going to go ahead and run with it.

HOW DO I READ THIS TRACKER?
As you’ll see down each side of the tracker is a box for each Parliamentary party and their leader. There are only six boxes, but seven parties in Parliament, so Peter Dunne and Te Ururoa Flavell are presently engaged in a brutal battle over the last box. We’ll keep you updated on who’s winning.
In fairness, David Seymour probably shouldn’t have his own box but we were unable to remove him after he aggressively asserted his property rights.
Underneath each party leader is a campaign performance star rating that reflects the current state of each party’s campaign.
In the middle of the graphic is an assortment of items that each of our party leaders will be attempting to collect the closer we get to election day. We’ll be allocating these each time we update the tracker, and if a leader acquires an item, it will be moved into their box. The Civilian is predicting that the party leader who acquires the most items will become Prime Minister.
These items include: the one ring of power, the west coast of Australia, a dictaphone, a Nissan Cube, the Whitcoulls Santa, a Cigna Funeral Plan, Don Brash’s glasses, Brian from Te Kuiti, a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black, Riche McCaw’s thighs, Stewart Island, Uncle Ben’s Special Fried Rice, a Guatemalan worry doll, the charred corpse of a sparrow, a rotten feijoa, Bob Parker’s parka, a bowtie, a box set of Coronation Street DVDs, a Kiwiburger, and Thingee’s missing eyeball.
Different party leaders will likely be seeking to acquire different items. For example: Winston Peters will be going after that Cigna Funeral Plan, while Andrew Little will definitely want a bottle of Johnnie Walker at this point.
Also at the bottom of our graphic we’ll be declaring the winner of the day, and the loser of the day.

"Peter Burling ruined parade by refusing to dress as Santa, say parents
","Children were left in tears and parents baffled as nobody from Emirates Team New Zealand played Santa in the victory parade.
Yesterday’s America’s Cup parade in Auckland is drawing intense scrutiny today, as parents who attended say it was “completely ruined” by Helmsman Peter Burling’s refusal to dress as Santa Claus.
“Disgraceful, really,” said Dylan Greysome, who weathered the wind and rain to bring his children to the parade. “Honestly put a damper on the whole thing. The rain, we could deal with that, but no Santa? I mean come on.”
Linda Draper said her two children, aged 2 and 4, were “devastated” when Santa never showed, despite “ample opportunity” provided by a lengthy procession.
“There were cars and floats for miles, you could’ve had at least one Santa Claus,” she said. “I spent three hours last night trying to convince my kids to come along. I promised them Santa, and now Team New Zealand are making it look like I lied to them.”
Responding to criticism, Burling has put forth a bizarre excuse, saying he didn’t dress as Santa because “it wasn’t a Santa parade.” But that explanation isn’t sitting well with parents.
“What does he mean it wasn’t a Santa parade?” said Draper. “I have no idea what that means.”
Grant Dalton is also under fire to not being Dave Dobbyn.
“That was a disappointment to many as well,” she added.
Organisers are hoping for a do-over when the parade hits Wellington on Tuesday, and while there’s still no word on whether Burling will cave to the pressure to be Santa, Grant Dalton has said he will endeavour to dress as Dave Dobbyn.
But that effort isn’t convincing a growing number of outraged, many of whom now believe Team New Zealand “must” construct a sleigh as their vessel for the next America’s Cup.
Prime Minister Bill English said he could understand parents’ “frustration,” and hoped that Team New Zealand would find it in themselves to construct a sleigh for the cup’s defence, as that was “the least they could do.”
When pressed further, English was forced to concede that “is actually probably the most they can do.”
“Yeah, I have to admit, I can’t imagine they could realistically do any more than that,” he said.",NaN,07/07/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nosantaparadefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Spithill reveals Cup is useless; was just trying to get rid of it the whole time
","“It’s a useless cup and I wanted to get rid of the bloody thing,” says Spithill.
Oracle Team USA skipper Jimmy Spithill has blamed his team’s America’s Cup loss on not wanting to win.
“It’s a useless cup and I wanted to get rid of the bloody thing,” he told media today, breaking his silence for the first time since the initial post-match press conference.
“The past seven years have been a nightmare. I don’t know who designed it but it’s obvious they never used a cup in their lives.
“I think more about the America’s Cup than my own family. It really is an obsession.”
Spithill said the problems first came to light when the Oracle team tried to drink champagne from the Cup following their 2010 win.
“The thing weighs a bloody ton and you can’t drink from it single-handed, so good luck if you want a durrie to go with it.”
“We thought maybe it’d get easier, maybe when we hadn’t been racing right before, but it’s so long it’s like doing a yardie every time.”
Spithill said the problems only grew once he got the Cup home.
“Try fitting that in your standard-sized kitchen cupboard. You can’t. Too bloody tall. The kiwis had someone take to it with a sledgehammer when they had it to try and cut it down to size, but it didn’t work.”
Spithill said his frustrations with the Cup peaked in early 2013 when he tried to use it to make a mug cake.
“They call it the Auld Mug but you just try and make a simple mug cake in there. Bloody nightmare. Then you can’t clean the damn thing because it just goes on forever and you’d need an elephant trunk to get right up in that business.”
He said he was looking forward to losing the Cup in 2013, and almost succeeded. However, when Emirates Team New Zealand were up 8-1, Oracle boss Larry Ellison promised that if Spithill claimed victory, he’d keep the Cup in one of his garages. “Didn’t bloody happen though, did it?” Spithill said quietly while carving an AC/DC logo into the desk.
Since then Spithill attempted to use the Cup as a travel mug (“Doesn’t have a lid, doesn’t fit in the cup holder”), for baking measurements (“It’s not even an actual cup”), and as a coffee mug at the office (“Someone crooked fucker always thieves off with it”).
Spithill also noted that the Cup is not dishwasher or microwave safe and doesn’t fit under an espresso machine.
“Don’t know how the kiwis expect to get it under their Nespresso machine. They’re dreaming.”
“You go home at night and you can’t wait to get up and leave in the morning just so you can get away from it.”
Spithill said the team had tried hard to lose every race in the 2017 regatta.
Apart from one accidental win, he was happy with their efforts. “Every day I just try, I put everything I have in to getting the result.
“And now I have.”
Emirates Team New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling said the kiwis hadn’t yet decided what they’d do with the Cup, but were entertaining offers from the Te Papa bagcheck counter and a Hamilton McDonald’s, for display in the playground.
He added that after “all the hubbub” of the past few weeks, the team was looking forward to a return to the normality of New Zealanders not caring about sailing.",NaN,28/06/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/spithillcupfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Team New Zealand perfectly poised to lose 7-6
","Peter Burling says that setting this up was a “very delicate process” that required making sure to lose just one race before getting to six points.
After two consecutive wins against Team Oracle in Bermuda, Emirates Team New Zealand have set themselves up perfectly to lose the competition 7-6.
The New Zealanders pushed themselves out to a 6-1 lead this morning, maintaining the position they’ve held for the last four years; one win from victory.
Helmsman Peter Burling said he was “very happy” to have reached the same milestone the team did in 2013.
“A large match-point lead is what we’ve been aiming for this whole competition,” he said, ”so we’re very happy to get here, and we feel we’re now well poised to lose from this point on.”
But despite a cautious optimism, Burling says the job isn’t done yet, and that it “won’t be easy” to lose another six races in a row.
“That will be a challenge,” he said, “and I think Jimmy [Spithill] and his crew will certainly give it their best shot.”
For his part, Spithill isn’t counting his chickens either, and is instead planning to race boats.
“We’re not taking this for granted, no,” said Spithill, who answered questions today flanked by 3 screens playing the last race of the 2013 Cup in San Francisco. “The consensus amongst our guys is really, this is going far, far too much to plan for our liking.
“In some ways it almost looks like they’re trying to give us the win, so we have to be wary of that.”
Asked if he could turn the video down so reporters could hear his answers, he replied “No, I won’t do that.”
Despite the fact there may only be one race left in the competition, Oracle has demanded four more press conferences for tomorrow morning, as Spithill feels he hasn’t talked enough yet.",NaN,26/06/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/perfectlypoisedfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Opinion: I would never listen to any of my employees
","By Winston Peters.
By my count, it’s been four days since the Prime Minister and his smarmy little yuppie were exposed for what they are: liars, crooks, filthy, cronyistic, career-politician peddlers of self-interested rubbish.
One of them is gone and the other remains, and I ask, why? The answer is obvious, but probably not to the sanctimonious bottom feeders in the media.
I never listen to any of my employees, that’s the way it used to be, and by golly, that’s the way it should be.
I had a woman come into my office just last week saying she worked for me, and I said “Alright, get on with it, then.”
She told me we were 8% in our internal polls, and I said “Listen here, sunshine. You know what I think of these polls, don’t you?”
And she said something, I don’t know, and I said “Rubbish. They’re rubbish is what they are, they’re a reprehensible smear job by a media in cahoots with the establishment.”
I threw it in the bin, she cried, and then I went back to reading my thesaurus in preparation for Question Time.
Leadership is what we need in this country, that’s the first thing, and real leadership means knowing when to speak and when others should stop speaking.
The Prime Minister knew for sixteen months that Todd Barclay was listening to an employee of his and did nothing. For that alone he should resign.
I have no idea what any of my MPs are doing because I never listen to any of them. For goodness sakes I didn’t even know there were other MPs until April when someone else stood up and asked a question on behalf New Zealand First. I had to raise a point of order just to find out what the hell was going on.

"Todd Barclay made decision to resign after listening to himself on dictaphone
","Barclay says hearing himself “say things” was the “final straw.”
Embattled National MP Todd Barclay resigned yesterday over allegations that he had maliciously recorded one of his staffers, Glenys Dickson.
The scandal also landed the Prime Minister, Bill English, in hot water, over conflicting statements he gave about his recollection of the incident, and his failure to do anything about it prior to it becoming public.
As a result, Barclay was under heavy pressure to resign, but he initially indicated he would not, saying he felt he was still “the best candidate to represent Clutha-Southland.”
But Barclay now says he changed his mind about that after listening to a secret recording he made of himself on a dictaphone.
“I did not come off very well [in that recording],” he told media this morning. “I don’t normally listen to myself or any of the things that come out of my mouth, but after discovering a secret recording I had covertly made of myself, I realised that I really am some sort of fuckwit.”
“I apologise for not seeing this earlier,” he added.
Barclay said he had this notion further confirmed after listening to covert dictaphone recordings he’d made of the Prime Minister, who also described him as a “slimy little prick” and blamed him for “everything.”
“The recordings I made of the Prime Minister in a private conversation with his wife further corroborated my hypothesis that I am some sort of fuckwit,” he said. “It was solely on the basis of these recordings – particularly the one of myself – that I made my decision to resign yesterday.”
Today, in the halls of Parliament, Bill English fronted media with three dictaphones taped to his shoes and one taped to his back.
“I think what Todd has said has made a lot of sense to me, and it reflects, largely, what I’ve been telling him for some time,” he said. “What I told the police was very simple, and frankly, very straightforward. I said ‘look, Todd is some kind of – I mean, I don’t like to use these words – but Todd is at least some variety of fuckwit’ and, really, generally speaking, I’d say I left it at that.”
When Newshub political editor Patrick Gower pointed out to English that he had at least four dictaphones taped to his person, he sighed and began removing them.
“Oh god,” said English. “How long have these been here?”

"Simon Barnett devastated to learn his co-host of the last ten years isn’t the real Gary McCormick
","Studio cameras reveal the moment Simon Barnett discovers he’s been hosting a show for ten years with a fake Gary McCormick.
MoreFM host Simon Barnett has been the victim of a deeply personal prank this morning, as he learned live on air that his co-host for the last ten years has not been the real Gary McCormick.
McCormick joined Barnett on MoreFM’s breakfast programme in 2003, but departed in 2007, and was replaced by long-time Gary McCormick impersonator Hank Acreman, all without Barnett’s knowledge.
Initially intended to be a short-lived prank, no one had the heart to tell Barnett the truth after seeing how well he got on with the new, fake Gary, and so Acreman became the permanent co-host of the show, pending a final reveal that never came to pass.
But on this morning’s show, the truth finally came out.
Just after returning from an ad break, Barnett was engaging in friendly banter with his co-host, when producer Samantha Baxter finally felt it was time.
“Simon, that’s not the real Gary,” she said.
“What?” he replied.
“It’s not the real Gary, Simon. He’s not Gary McCormick, he’s a professional Gary McCormick impersonator.”
Barnett initially laughed off the prank, remarking how similar he seemed, and how impressed he was that Baxter and the station had set this up “just for today.”
“No, Simon, not just today, he’s… he’s been gone for ten years,” said Baxter.
Barnett sat in baffled silence, a look of fear on his face.
“You’re not serious?” he asked.
“This hasn’t been Gary for ten years,” she told him. “He’s just an impersonator, the real Gary left the show a decade ago.”
“Oh my god,” said Barnett, reeling. “That’s… that’s going to be in the newspapers tomorrow, that’s just so disappointing. That’s just so uncool. Why would you even do that? What about the time we spent at my home?”
“That’s not me,” interjected Acreman. “That’s the real Gary.”
“I told you my deepest secrets!” protested Barnett.
Acreman was silent.
“Oh lord,” said Barnett.
“I’m so sorry, Simon,” said Baxter, now in tears. “We replaced your family as well, your wife, your kids, they’re impersonators.”
“What?” asked Barnett, quivering now. “Why my family?”
“I don’t know,” she sobbed. “I don’t know why we did that bit, it wasn’t even on air, it didn’t make any sense, I’m so sorry.”
“No one loves you, Simon,” she added, “and I feel so terrible. No one loves you, it was all fake.”
Barnett stared at the ground in silence, saying “Oh my god” to himself over and over, as the show cut to advertisements.

"Hundreds injured in Police Ten 7 police brutality special
","TVNZ producers have conceded they could’ve made their point without hurting “quite that many people”
Hundreds have suffered minor to moderate injuries as a result of last night’s controversial episode of Police Ten 7, a police brutality special that showcased the darker side of New Zealand law enforcement.
The long-running show, which typically follows friendly police officers as they cordially dispense justice to yobbos and mad buggers, took an abruptly dark turn Thursday evening, instead showcasing officers abusing their authority in an often violent manner.
“Police Ten 7 has been a staple of our programming for many years,” said TVNZ content director Jeff Latch, “but even with a proven formula, we believe that educational shows like these still need to occasionally challenge audiences to think differently about the material they’re being presented.
“So we asked our officers who usually feature on the show to let their guard down, and perhaps engage in the potentially violent, dangerous and illegal activities they’d normally try to keep off-camera.”
Host Rob Lemoto opened last night’s episode with a dramatic monologue.
“Tonight we follow our officers as they engage in behaviour that will shock and enrage our viewers,” he said. “It is outrageous behaviour. It is unacceptable behaviour. It’s an abuse of power that knows no bounds, and tonight, I am frankly disgusted by the actions of our men and women.
“It makes me furious that these kind of inhuman actions could be conducted for ratings purposes.
“Let’s watch.”
The episode featured numerous contentious interactions between police and suspects of minor offences, in which many were injured, both physically and emotionally, by pushing and shoving, swearing and threats from officers.
In one incident, Officer Wilson Barry violently assaulted a speeding motorist by hurling him through his own windshield.
He calmly explained his actions to the camera afterwards.
“So what I’ve just done here is I’ve pulled him over for a routine speeding ticket,” said Barry. “He was exceeding the limit by about 12 or 13 kilometres. I’ve had a little chat with him, he understands he needs to be more mindful, then I’ve lost my temper and I’ve put his head through the windshield.
“He, uh, won’t go home a very happy chappy tonight, but hopefully he’s learned a lesson and we won’t be seeing him again.”

"Could this year’s America’s Cup be marred by the fact it’s a horrible sport where the winner makes the rules and nobody cares?
","One New Plymouth spectator, Tom Sturgeon, says he won’t let the fact he hates and simply can’t stand the America’s Cup stop him from enjoying it.
It’s game on!
After winning a fifth race to beat Artemis in the last contest of the qualifying round, Emirates Team New Zealand has made their way to a highly-anticipated clash with Oracle in the America’s Cup final.
The stage is set. The contest will be close, and New Zealand will have the chance to once again make the America’s Cup New Zealand’s Cup.
But some are already saying this year’s final could be overshadowed, perhaps even marred, by the fact the America’s Cup is a terrible, overly complicated, comically litigious excuse for a sport where the winner makes the rules – often for their own benefit – and nobody in the world actually cares about it anyway.
It’s a minor gripe to be sure, but some are already cautioning organisers to be wary, and not let it take away from the spectacle.
Oracle’s Jimmy Spithill conceded there was a risk, albeit only a small one.
“I don’t think too much about that, and ultimately, I think that’ll all come out in the wash,” he said. “The America’s Cup will be raced, it will be watched. It has too much of a rich history to be marred by the fact it’s objectively terrible, pointless, and should never happen again.”
Team NZ helmsman Peter Burling agreed.
“It’s a problem, to be sure,” he said. “But it’s just one problem. You don’t do away with an event just because you should for every conceivable reason.”
Radio Sport commentator Tony Veitch thinks the boys have it right.
“Definitely,” he said. “If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my career, you don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. You can’t take one thing. You have to look at the whole picture.

"Hot take: Did the All Blacks deliberately lose every game they ever lost?
","Every New Zealander is born with an innate understanding that rugby is a game between two nations that is won by the team that is the All Blacks.
You’d certainly have to think so.
The Mighty All Blacks, the greatest team ever to play rugby, or, arguably, any sport ever, are preparing to face The British & Irish Lions in the test match leg of this decade’s Lions tour.
But have they ever lost? Certainly not fairly, and probably not without meaning to, either.
It goes without saying that the Mighty All Blacks are the modern pinnacle of sporting excellence, so it seems hard to believe that they’d lose any game without it being part of a larger plan.
An esteemed panel of level-headed rugby analysts would surely agree, though we haven’t asked them. It truly isn’t necessary.
From the 2007 World Cup loss in Cardiff, to that one time Ireland beat us, there is substantial evidence to suggest the All Blacks are deliberately throwing games as a part of a larger strategic plan that it would be extremely difficult for other, weaker-minded rugby nations to understand.
Take a look at this still shot from that World Cup quarterfinal against France:

Now, who do you think the man in the red circle is? That’s right. That’s Jerry Collins. He’s an excellent rugby player.
You’ll also notice that in this screenshot, New Zealand are ahead of France.
Just a quick Google search, which, with the right technology, you could even do at home, will tell you that in a game of Rugby Union, the team with the most points wins.
So what gives? Why did the All Blacks lose? Something is amiss.
Take a look at this still shot from the 2016 Chicago “loss” against Ireland:

You’ll notice that at around 25 minutes into game time, the All Blacks are just standing around in one place on the field. No wonder they’re ten points behind!
We can tell from the shape of the formation that it’s deliberate.
But why? Why would the All Blacks deliberately lose to Ireland?
We can only speculate. Coach Steve Hansen clearly had a plan, and whether it’s to do with lowering the guard of our opposition, keeping the spirit of the game alive, or just being the all round good guys that the big-hearted boys are, we’ll never be entirely sure.
But we do know one thing: Richie McCaw and Jonah Lomu.
Other countries might describe our rugby and our fans as arrogant, but on the merits, and the fact that we deliberately lose games to make other nations feel better and think they have a chance, it appears that, actually, we may just be the most humble rugby nation of all.

"Hundreds of passengers stranded in Hamilton after their flights to Hamilton landed there
","Civil Aviation Authorities are finding it difficult to believe Air New Zealand’s explanation that people have simply chosen to fly to Hamilton.
Hundreds of passengers are stranded in the city of Hamilton tonight after their flights to Hamilton landed at their correct destination, prompting widespread concern for their wellbeing.
As many as two to three hundred passengers may be caught up in the debacle, with none of them having a subsequent flight out of the city.

Tillerson will arrive in Wellington on Tuesday, and English says he wants all New Zealanders to “tidy up” and “look busy.”

"National will offer family tax breaks to native birds at risk of extinction
","What’s this bird? Who knows? What did it ever do for you?
The National Government has swiftly announced a plan to tackle the desperate situation of New Zealand’s native birds, after a scathing report from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment found that 80% of such species were in trouble, with many headed for extinction.
The native moa was famously hunted to extinction by early settlers after it became too fat to run away anymore, and many of our contemporary native birds are now headed the same way.
The report – which is a lot of pages and could really use some more pictures – found that species of native bird were in serious danger for a variety of reasons, from feral cats, to kea being caught in windscreen wipers, to others being mistakenly fried at Gore’s KFC.
Such was the seriousness of the situation outlined in the report that the Government has moved to reassure the public there are already plans in place to encourage breeding and salvage the birds’ populations.
Conservation Minister and herself a species of endangered bird, Maggie Barry, said that the focus would be on family tax breaks for birds who were struggling to find a “financial incentive” to have children.
“The pressures that affect the decision to have children – and how many to have – are ultimately economic pressures,” she wrote in a statement. “This is why Finance Minister Steven Joyce will tomorrow be detailing a series of tax breaks for endangered birds, to the tune of $25 a week per offspring, up to $100 a week per offspring, as well as a one off $900 tax credit for nest construction.”
The opposition is already criticising the plan, with Labour leader Andrew Little saying the Government isn’t going far enough, and tax credits amount to “poor targeting” of the native bird population, as some species, such as whio, typically don’t have jobs.
“If we’re talking about tax breaks, to have a tax break, you need an income,” said Little, “and a lot of whio don’t even have jobs.”
On Twitter, Barry hit back this evening, accusing Little of calling whio lazy.
“Shame on @AndrewLittleMP,” she wrote. “Your words will be very poorly received in the whio community tonight #hardworkers”

"Trump Middle East peace plan derailed after discovering Israel already has a wall
","Who would’ve thought Middle East peace could be so complicated?
An announcement about President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace proposal has been indefinitely postponed after he discovered that Israel already has a wall.
The proposal, which the President himself purportedly spent all of yesterday writing, was one page long, size 72 font, and read, in full:
WALL.
According to aides travelling with the President, he agonised for hours over the finer details of the plan, including whether it should read “BUILD A WALL”, whether perhaps “wall” should be the only word in capitals, and how to spell “build.”
Eventually, Trump settled on just “WALL”, which it took him 143 minutes to write without making a mistake.
“I think the reporting done so far has already shed light on the fact there was a lot of work done to put together this proposal,” said White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is travelling with the President as he heads to the Vatican today.
Trump was preparing to present the proposal this morning before flying to Rome, but was blindsided when he discovered that the Jewish state of Israel already has a wall, surrounding both the West Bank and Gaza.
“What’s this?” Trump asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, shortly before the scheduled announcement. He pointed to a section of the West Bank wall.
Netanyahu explained to Trump that this was Israel’s “security wall.”
Reporters close to the scene said Trump appeared distant following that exchange, and instead of listening to the Prime Minister, just stared into space for the next hour or so.
In a statement this evening (GMT+2), the President explained the indefinite scuttling of his peace plan:
I have always said peace in the Middle East will not be easy. It will not be easy, by no means. In this part of the world, it takes a lot to win, believe you me.
It is in spite of the big, beautiful wall that Israel has built – perhaps I wouldn’t say beautiful, I have heard some people say, even, that it is, at best, a second rate wall – but a tremendous wall nonetheless.
It is in spite of this, that there continues to be bloodshed in this part of the world, and perhaps, as we have learned from history, this wall is not high enough.
If there is ever to be peace between Israel and the other one, it will take much work, and many pages, so many pages, probably more than two. The printing, I mean, the cost is unimaginable.
It is my hope that I will be able to achieve this – deals, it’s what I do – and I will be thinking very hard to have an idea, an idea for everyone.
In just the last few hours, it is reported the President has found “new hope” for peace, after learning that Palestine does not have a wall.",NaN,24/05/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/israelwallfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake

With just a week to go until the start of the competition, this sure looks like a big faux pas for boss Grant Dalton, who promised the Government he would have “a boat” come competition time.
“Admittedly, this is not a boat,” said Dalton this afternoon, standing next to what looked more like a 1997 Chrysler Concorde with little fins attached.
“I can explain,” he added, before shuffling slowly away from news cameras.
An explanation from Dalton is still pending at this hour, but director Stephen Tindall shared some insight into how the design played out.
“Well we lost last time, as you know,” explained Tindall. “So this time we didn’t really want to constrain the design. We just said to everybody ‘Right, don’t worry about how this will win a race just yet, just, put in things you like.’
“We just assumed we could make it seaworthy later, make some adjustments once we had the base model, so don’t worry, you know? But obviously what we’ve got here is a car.”
Tindall sighed audibly and rested his head in his hands.
“Oh god.”
Representatives for Team NZ say it’s “too late” to begin another design, and they’ll have to race the Chrysler.
“At the moment, there’s a bit of a panic down at the docks,” said one source close to the team. “People running around, putting floatation devices on the wheels, adding extra fins, putting a sail on it, a motor at the back, but ultimately, I just think we’ll have to race it as it is.”
Initial trial runs are said to have been quite promising, with the watercraft performing “very well” on land.",NaN,19/05/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/teamnzcarfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"National election ad where Bill English defeats Andrew Little in climactic rap battle ‘just a massive coincidence’
","PICTURED: A Poster for National’s leaked web ad, State Highway 6.
A National Party web advertisement that depicts Prime Minister Bill English as he grows up in a caravan with his single mother and eventually defeats Labour leader Andrew Little in a climactic rap battle that puts him on the path to fame is being defended as “merely a coincidence” by the party’s lawyers.
The leaked ad, which is 1 hour 58 minutes long and not meant for release until later this year, is set on a holiday park near Dipton in Southland.
The working title for the ad is State Highway 6, a reference to the road that runs through Dipton and divides Dipton West from Dipton East, a division that largely acts as a border between the town’s warring rap factions.
Critics have blasted the ad, saying it bears striking resemblance to the 2002 Eminem semi-biopic 8 Mile, but National’s lawyers are hitting back in a statement today, saying any similarity to that film is “purely a coincidence.”
“In the advertisement – which is an advertisement, not a motion picture – the Prime Minister is represented by the protagonist, B. English,” the statement read. “B. English is a promising young rap artist who writes and performs excellent rhymes about STEADY LEADERSHIP and PROVEN RESULTS FOR REGULAR NEW ZEALANDERS (themes are denoted in bold).
“This is a story based on true events, and the EXPERIENCEs of the Prime Minister growing up in Dipton, and while partially fictionalised, is in no way based upon any other work of the same time of exactly 1 hour 58 minutes.”
In the advertisement, B. English takes on a rap gang – known only as the Labour Union – after they attack him outside his mother’s caravan.
English struggles to find the confidence and motivation to outrhyme the Union, but with the help of his best friends Steven Joyce and Big Gerry, eventually finds the inner strength to take on their leader – Andrew Little – one on one, in a rap battle to end all rap battles.
Little ultimately loses, and the credits roll with an appeal to party vote National, which plays over the advertisement’s theme song. The song features the following lyrics:
Yo
His palms are sweaty, arms weak, tray is heavy
There’s pineapple on his pizza already, canned spaghetti
He’s nervous, but after eating he’ll be calm and ready,
For a walk-run. He’ll keep on leading steady.
The accusations of plagiarism will come as bad news for the party, which is already defending a copyright case over its similarity to the Australian Liberal Party.",NaN,18/05/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/statehighwaysix-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Ransomware virus will only unlock users’ computers if Bill English hands over secret family pizza recipe
","Infected users are beginning to panic this evening as English appears unwilling to disclose exactly what is in the pizza, or where the uphill bits are.
Many of the nation’s businesses are at a standstill this evening as a ransomware virus that locks users out of their computers rapidly spreads across the country.
The virus, named WannaPiece, encrypts users’ files so they can’t be accessed, and threatens not to decrypt them unless Prime Minister Bill English discloses his secret spaghetti and pineapple pizza recipe, and – if he is not immediately forthcoming – the location of his now-famous walk-runs.
English describes the walk-run as an activity where you “walk the uphill bits and run the downhill bits,” which is also said to be the National Party’s working slogan for this year’s election.
A message and accompanied countdown timer appears on infected systems’ screens, and reads:
“Can I recover my files?
Sure. We guarantee that you can recover all your files safely and easily. But only if your Prime Minister hands over the secret recipe to his famous family pizza.
If he does not do so within 3 days, we will also require the location of his reportedly excellent walk-run track.
If these details have not been provided to us by the Prime Minister in 7 days, your files will be lost forever.”
With less than 72 hours remaining in the first countdown, the Prime Minister’s office has refused to cave, and Bill English, speaking to media this evening, said he did not under “any circumstances” want to disclose to “anybody” what is in the pizza, because it would be “embarrassing.”
“That is not an option,” he said, firmly. “There must be another way, and we’re looking into it.”
When pressed, English floated several possible contingency plans.
“Obviously we’re concerned about this, but we don’t negotiate with criminals, and we are presently in talks with hospitals and other essential services to offer them alternative solutions,” he read from a post-it note. “These include turning the computer on and off again, uninstalling the virus, and checking to see if the screen is plugged in.”
Asked how checking to see if the screen is plugged in would remove the virus, English said it was “very important” that “computer screens are plugged in.”
“Otherwise you don’t see anything,” he added.
English said that while the pizza recipe was off-limits, if worst came to worst, he may be open to negotiating some details about the walk-run, as “theoretically I could do that somewhere else,” though adding he “never has.”",NaN,15/05/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wannapizzafeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Five things you didn’t know about bananas because they aren’t true
","PICTURED: Lots of bananas
The internet sure is a wonderful place. There’s so much to know!
We’ve come a long way from the days where a teenager’s greatest learning experience on a computer was typing “vagina” into Encarta.
Nowadays, when you type a naughty word into your search bar, the results are much better.
Indeed, the knowledge available to anyone with a basic internet connection is so vast it’s overwhelming. Kids who grew up in cities used to only know a couple of animals. Now they know lots! Like cow, chicken, beef, and more!
Did you know that, in the past, you could only know things that were true? Thanks to the internet, you can now know things that aren’t! You can know anything you want!
Even mundane, everyday objects have millions of facts about them you didn’t even know, but are now at your fingertips.
Take bananas, for example.
No, really! There are countless fun facts about bananas you might never have heard just because they aren’t true!
Here are just a few:
1. Banana is an ancient Roman word for “Humph! No, no!”
Romans hated bananas because they would regularly grow like weeds on crucifixion crosses, and provide food to those hanging on them. This would often mean criminals would last 3-4 days longer than scheduled, creating a massive backlog that led to out of control administration costs.
2. You can make a little toy phone by drilling six holes in two bananas and tying them together with string
Try this fun party trick with your kids. Give them two bananas and your biggest electric drill, and let them make their own telephones that can be used to hear one another at a range of two to four metres. It’s best if you don’t supervise them, as that way, they’ll learn nothing.
3. A banana republic is a type of clothing store with stratified social classes that relies solely on the exportation of limited resources and the exploitation of labour
The labourers are bananas.
4. Bananas were initially domesticated as pets
Back in the early times, before microwaves, wild bananas were domesticated as pets, and were never thought of as food. This was because they were worshipped as divine creatures by the ancient Wololo people, who lived during the Age of Empires.
But as more secular forces got their hands on the banana, it was increasingly felt they were terrible pets, as they didn’t actually do anything. And so began banana farming, and eventually, banana consumption.
5. Cricket was initially played with bananas
Ever wonder how the now-mandatory practice of overarm bowling began in cricket? It’s because bowlers originally didn’t bowl with balls. Instead, they hurled bananas at the batsman – as many as they could throw at a time – and he had to fend them off from the stumps before taking a run.
Banana peels were not allowed to be removed from the wicket, and these served as additional obstacles for batsmen when taking runs.
Well now, wasn’t that a lot of fun? We hope you’ve learned a lot, and remember: it’s always important to keep learning things, so share these facts with your friends, or come up with your own, so together, we can keep stuffing our heads full of all kinds of shit.",NaN,12/05/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bananafactsfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"FULL TEXT: President Trump’s dismissal letter to FBI Director James Comey
","Dear Director Comey,
I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General – who was a fantastic appointment and very well praised, by, I think, everybody – and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.
While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.
While I also appreciate, greatly, your six phone calls informing me of my tremendous taste in Oval Office furnishings, as well the enormous size of my inauguration crowd – which you repeatedly insisted was the biggest you had ever seen – I will still have to move ahead with your dismissal.
I do not take the decision lightly, in part because of your very generous belief that the 110 days you have served under my administration has been the best 110 days of your career, and because you have told me, on more than one occasion, that my presidency has been tremendously effective, perhaps, even, one of the most effective ever.
It is in fact, in spite of those things, and in spite of the fact you told me that there is an enormous, ongoing investigation into wiretapping conducted by the Obama administration targeting me, my family, and potentially vulnerable disabled veterans that could, foreseeably, lead to charges of treason punishable by death, that I have to make the decision – in the interests of the country – that you must leave your post as soon as possible.
What makes it especially hard to make such a call are your repeated reassurances that my poll numbers are very high, very good, like you wouldn’t believe, and that on the occasions that you have met her, Hillary Clinton smelled very, very bad indeed.
It is also my understanding that you may be relieved to hear this news, as you have told me recently you are getting very tired because of all the winning our administration is doing. Winning can be quite tiring, but I am afraid that we will keep on winning, and it is the advice of both the Attorney General – who you have told me four times you think was an excellent choice that I made – and the Deputy Attorney General, that the Bureau is in need of someone who is more cut out for winning.
It is essential, even though you have confided in me that you think Barack Obama is dumb and that Chuck Schumer is a loser (very sad!), that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.
In closing, despite the fact you voted for me in both the primaries and the general election and donated the maximum allowable amount to my campaign, I must wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors,
Donald J. Trump
 
P.S. I did receive your text message about the Bureau’s discovery that the nasty women who accused me of horrible things during the campaign were agents of a foreign government. That was greatly appreciated, and I respect your desire not to disclose that publicly at this time.",NaN,11/05/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trumpcomeyletter-300x205.jpg,Fake
"“I’m no hero,” says man who bravely rescued drowning boy so he could harvest his organs
","Jacob Turnbull says he’s mentally ill and has killed countless other children, but the boy’s family say he doesn’t need to play down his heroic actions.
A man who rescued a drowning boy on Wednesday is humbly claiming he isn’t a hero, saying he only saved the boy to brutally harvest his organs for use in some kind of sick breeding machine.
But the boy’s parents are pushing back, saying the man is just “being modest,” and they couldn’t be more grateful for his heroism.
Jacob Turnbull, 43 of Whitianga, rescued the 12-year-old after he got caught in a rip at Mercury Bay in the Coromandel.
His parents were unaware he’d been swept out at the time when Turnbull decided to risk his own life to rescue him.
By the time he’d dragged the boy back ashore, his parents were waiting anxiously, and were “overjoyed” to have him returned.
They embraced Turnbull, and showered him with praise.
“We just couldn’t believe it,” said the boy’s mother, who asked to remain anonymous, but wanted the “whole world” to know of “what a wonderful and selfless man Jacob is.”
“If he weren’t there, God knows what would’ve happened to him.”
But confronted by media today, Turnbull says he’s no hero.
“Oh, I’m no hero,” he said. “Really, I’m not. I didn’t think the parents were around, and actually, I just wanted to harvest that boy’s organs for this machine I’m making.”
The man’s humility has only further endeared him to the parents and Whitianga locals.
“I’m actually quite sick in the head. I need help,” he added.

"We’re just going to go ahead and report that Prince Philip is dead because it’ll be true soon enough anyway
","1921 – 2017 or thereabouts.
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, husband of the Queen, and member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg has passed away this morning at age 95.
And if he hasn’t, that’ll be true soon enough anyway, so just bookmark this page and pull it back up when that happens.
Philip reportedly suffered a heart attack while looking at a common pheasant on the grounds of Buckingham Palace at sunset last night, Greenwich Mean Time, and died in hospital hours later.
Speculation about his passing has run rampant throughout the night, with conflicting messages being sent to different news agencies, reportedly as a result of a common and long-standing issue where palace servants have been routinely unable to tell whether or not Philip is alive.
While TVNZ, NZME and Fairfax are all reporting that Philip is – as far as anyone is aware – alive and well, we are reporting that he has died.
We may be called wrong, inaccurate, and even irresponsible for doing so, but we believe, in time, the ultimate course of events will bear out the truth, and sometime in the future, however long it may take, we will be proven correct.

"For first year on record, New Zealand weather more miserable than New Zealand humans
","And it’s probably our fault, say weatherologists.
In a report to be issued on Friday, New Zealand’s national forecaster is set to announce that for the first year on record, the country’s weather is well on track to being even more miserable than its humans.
“What we’re seeing is quite extraordinary, actually,” said MetService meteorologist Lisa Murray. “We’ve reached the end of summer, a couple of months into autumn now, going on winter shortly, and you’d be really hard pressed to say we’ve had a summer at all.
“The weather has been the most miserable we’ve seen in a very, very long time, and this is the first time it’s been even more miserable than we are.”
MetService measures the miserableness of the weather with their in-house clown, Roy, who looks out the window and responds with various facial expressions. These expressions are then measured and converted into points of SAD, which is an acronym for Simple Acronym Device.
This year, Roy’s facial expressions have been at their most miserable since he began working there in 1973.
So miserable, in fact, they racked up more points of SAD than the country as a whole, whose own unhappiness is measured by a multitude of variables, including alcohol consumption, average number of channels changed before settling, and time spent refreshing the MetService homepage.
“It’s really quite difficult to be more miserable than we are as a population,” said Murray. “But, lo and behold, this year, the weather’s done it.”
“It’s actually especially hard because the more miserable the weather gets, that drags us down as well,” she added.
Asked whether it was possible this year’s measurements were a result of us getting happier, Murray replied “God, no. Certainly not.”
“There is a silver lining to this kind of weather, though,” she said. “For once, when you’re stuck inside at work, mulling on your regrets and pondering what on earth you’re doing with your life, you can look outside, and be assured that out there, things are even worse.”
MetService also says the weather has conclusively disproved global warming, as it rained and was cold at a point.",NaN,03/05/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unhappyweatherfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Opinion: Well, I like planes
","By Former Prime Minister John Key.
Hi. I’m John Key, Prime Minister of New Zealand.
One of them, anyway. If anyone knows who the current one is, that would be good. I need to send them a letter.
Well, I like planes. I think most New Zealanders would agree there’s nothing like that cool New Zealand air up in the sky, very high, on one of our state of the art Air New Zealand planeses.
I like nothing more than soaring high above those special Southern Alps, and rolling down that window to take in some of that 100% pure kiwi goodness. It feels just wonderful as I let the wind flow through my hair and slowly lose consciousness with a nice pinot noir.
I especially love the takeoff, ascent, cruise, descent and landing parts of flight, and I want to share that joy with the millions and millions of dollars in my bank account.
That’s why, at the end of the day, I’ve decided to accept kind of, a directorship role, if you’d like, with Air New Zealand, because I love planeses.
I love the whir and hiss of the engines, and the thrill of a good turbulence.
As a director, I want to ensure that all New Zealanders have a fun and safe flight with funny intro videos about Hobbits, and also don’t crash into Erebus again.
When I was a boy, I went on a plane with my mother.
What I love about flying, is that you can do things in the air that, previously, you could only do on the ground, like sitting. Imagine going back to the olden days, and seeing the look on a caveman’s face when you told him that you could eat a little bag of crisps while sitting in a chair on its way through the sky to Queenstown.
He’d look at you and say “No way!”
People ask me if I like Jetstar. I say “Not overly.”
I think most New Zealanders would agree that Jetstar don’t give you a lolly at the end, and actually, we don’t like that very much.
People want to know how things are going to change now that I’m a director, and I’m not sure, really. Not overly, I’d imagine.
Bigger planeses, obviously. Windows you can roll down. I’ve never understood why there’s not an option for that. Uhm, more wings, maybe? At the end of the day, all I’ve really told the board I’m concerned about at the moment is modernising that iconic Air New Zealand dress code, making sure everyone looks their very best, with their hair neatly tied back.

"The Blues to tape over Sonny Bill Williams for upcoming fixtures
","Artist’s depiction of what Sonny Bill Williams will look like come Sunday’s game against the Brumbies.
Blues CEO Michael Redman says that star player Sonny Bill Williams will continue to play for the team, but will be taped over with thick black tape during upcoming fixtures.
The move comes as a result of continuing controversy over Williams’ decision to tape over two bank logos (those of BNZ and Investec) on his playing jersey earlier this month.
Redman acknowledged that the controversy had “died down” somewhat, but the Blues had not played in a couple of weeks, and he did not want it to “reignite” when they play the Brumbies in Canberra on Sunday.
“As far as we’re concerned, we don’t want this coming up again,” he said. “It’s been talked about enough, and frankly, at this point, it’s an internal matter.
“But we are also aware that when Sonny Bill goes out there on Sunday, all eyes will be on him, all eyes will be on his jersey.”
The team had concluded after “extensive discussion” that the “only” reasonable solution was to tape over Sonny Bill entirely, “so no one will see him, or even know that it’s him.”
Asked whether it would be obvious that it was Sonny Bill by virtue of him being the only player stumbling around in tape unable to see two feet in front of him, Redman replied “Not necessarily.”
“You never know,” he said. “Sure, you could assume it’s him, but if you can’t see him, you never really know. It’s like Schrodinger’s cat. You know, in the sense that, when the tape comes off, he could very well be dead.”
Following that statement, the Blues have made a decision to tape over two additional players to make things a “little less obvious” and “admittedly, because we’ve run out of money to pay sponsors for all 15 players.”
As the Blues continue to languish at the bottom of the New Zealand conference, there are indications things may be escalating this evening, with initial reports that several other players are now taping over their Blues logos as a conscientious objection to people knowing they play for the Blues.",NaN,28/04/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tapingsonnyfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"The Greens: Because you take great pride in riding your bicycle to your coal-heated workplace
","In many places in this great, impenetrable Anglosphere of ours, voters and non-voters alike are increasingly dissatisfied with their political choices.
They’ve realised that by continuing to vote for the same handful of parties over and over, all they’re doing is reaching reasonable compromises any functioning society needs to make if it’s to bring the disparate opinions of millions into something that will actually achieve meaningful though at times frustratingly incremental progress.
Instead, younger generations have gradually reached the epiphany that the more socially responsible thing to do is to embrace a crude and lazy reductionism that paints ever-moving and necessarily binary political parties as rigid institutions that never change, and that the appropriate response to this is to sit at home, not vote, and then blame everybody who did. God bless you Russell Brand.
Fortunately, in New Zealand, we don’t have that problem. Not sure why we were even talking about any of that. Because in New Zealand, we love our political parties, and we’re perfectly satisfied with them.
Every one of them has its own extraordinary merits, and over the next several weeks and months, The Civilian will be leading up to this year’s election by profiling each of them individually.
This week: The Green Party, Parliament’s upmarket tinny house.
Do you work in a coal-heated workspace but still take great pride in riding your bicycle there? Do you have a neatly-trimmed beard or own any item of clothing that contains more than 4 colours? Have you watched a whole episode of Last Week Tonight at any point in the last week? Are you afraid of your tomatoes? Do you often neglect to vote? Have you ever said something like “Oh I get my news from John Oliver and satire websites because it’s often more accurate and insightful than the real thing”? Do you have a throbbing pain in your urethra that only gets better when you put on old Live 8 concerts?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should vote Green. If you answered yes to the last question, you should see a doctor. Urgently.
The Green Party was formed in 1990, after the Electoral Commission accepted six joints and a gift box of colloidal silver and spring water in lieu of 500 paid financial memberships.
Seriously, though, if you did answer yes to that last question, see a doctor. Like, a real one. Not that holistic one that prescribes you fair trade Arabica beans.
Green voters consider their support for the party a badge of honour, one which they wear for two and a half years between elections.
Yes, Green voters are somewhat like a mirage; the closer you get to election day, the more they vanish into nothingness.
But don’t let that fool you into thinking the Greens aren’t a great party. They’re such a great party, that they have not one, but two leaders: One man, and one woman. This is presumably a statement about what marriage should be, because the Green Party believes the country can only be properly raised by a mix of gender influences.
This rule makes sure that no matter what happens, no matter the political circumstances or pool of leadership they have to draw from, there will always be a man in leadership; because men deserve a voice, and have important perspectives that are often ignored, in the workplace, in the boardroom, and in politics.
Thank God for the Greens for ensuring there’ll always be a man at the top to make sure the woman one knows what she’s doing.
Some might ask what happens if the Greens inherit the office of the Prime Minister or any other single important post: who will get the job? It doesn’t matter. That’ll never happen.
So what do the Greens stand for? It’s not just medicinal weed for 5-year-olds and giving trees the right to vote. It’s also other stuff, like medicinal weed for trees and giving 5-year-olds the right to vote.
The Greens believe in living within our means, and preserving the planet for future generations to enjoy and destroy.
The Greens are the party of science. Unlike some, they believe in the science of climate change, and while we haven’t checked, we can only assume they also believe in the science establishing the safety of GMO foods. That’s basically a given because they’re the party of science.
The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, as they are officially known, prides itself on the advocacy of the country’s poor and minority communities, particularly Maori. This is something reflected in their ethnically diverse caucus:

“So I take it poor and afflicted minorities must be amongst the Green Party’s core constituencies, then?”
Oh, no. No, no, no. Just white people.
So, if you’re a white person who’s been privileged enough to have the Government pay your way through university, consider voting Green this election. It’ll make you feel good, and like you’ve helped people who aren’t like you, while still being able to vote for people exactly like you.
Green Party: Fast Facts
Key policies: Endangered birds get a cut of your salary. Replace all police cars with police bicycles. Cars wired to explode if driven somewhere a bus route could’ve taken you.
Biggest asset: Huge untapped constituency could provide massive boost to party if only it knew how to vote.
Biggest liability: Out of touch with the rural community.
Best MP: Kennedy Graham: The Silver Fox.
Worst MP: Steffan Browning.

"MetService apologises for mistaking cloud for cyclone
","Experts say this week’s event will be remembered as the Big Cloud of 2017.
New Zealand’s national weather forecasting service has apologised to the country today for misforecasting a large cloud as a potentially catastrophic cyclone, formerly known as Cook, or the media-coined Cyclone 2: Many Cook spoils the Beach.
The initial forecast – which predicted the worst storm since 1968 – sent New Zealand and its impressionable media into a frenzied panic, with wall-to-wall coverage costing the life of at least one journalist.
Aucklanders rushed to their local supermarkets to buy out weeks’ worth of supplies, including one man who purchased the entire city supply of kitchen tongs.
But ultimately, it just rained a little, and there was what some described as a “distinct breeze.”
Meteorologist Rob Kerr says MetService is “deeply apologetic” for its error, and acknowledges this one was a “real doozy.”
“Turns out it was just a cloud,” he said. “Big cloud, like this big.” He held his arms out wide on either side of him. “But still a cloud, admittedly.”
Asked how it was possible that a team of highly qualified meteorologists could make such a mistake, Kerr said “Beats me.”
“Woops, I guess?” he explained. “I really don’t know. I mean, it looked like it could be something.”
He said those who had bought up huge amounts of bread and locked themselves underground could “come out now” and “enjoy your bread.”
“Look at it this way. If this had never happened, you’d never know the joy of having all that bread.”
The cloud barrelled down the North Island yesterday, leaving water, a cool breeze, and a lack of sunlight in its wake.

","PICTURED: Cyclone 2: Many Cook spoils the Beach
The open deliberation over how to refer to Cyclone Cook in media reports has been days in the process, with some referring to it as the Cookopalypse, while the New Zealand Herald pitched in with its suggestion of the “Cookie Monster.”
But as of tonight, while the storm travels south, media outlets appear to have coalesced around a more appropriate option: Cyclone 2: Many Cook spoils the Beach.
“That’s the graphic we’re running with on all our broadcasts now, yes,” said MediaWorks head of news Hal Crawford. “TVNZ are doing the same, and we expect other outlets to follow suit shortly. It’s just the logical thing to call it.”
Crawford said that while journalists had also considered Cooking up a Storm, Cooked Raw, and What does an oven do?, they ultimate didn’t make as much sense.
“The answer to that last one could actually be bake,” he said. “Cyclone 2: Many Cook spoils the Beach just speaks for itself, really. It’s clear, concise, simple, and easy to explain.
“It’s the second cyclone or ex-cyclone, rather, that we’ve seen in the last few weeks, so it’s a sequel in a way, and the 2, from the, you know, because it’s a, you know, because it’s a sequel, and often, when you make a movie, you call it like, you put a 2, like there was the Matrix, and then there was the Matrix – oh, wait. No. That, no, not that one.
“So you know how you could have like, Fast and the Furious, the one about the cars that go, and, uhm, the second one, they put a 2. They put two 2s, actually, which was clever because it fit in the title, which was 2 Fast 2 Furious, and the number 2 made sense because it was the second one but also there were two 2s, and presumably two cars.
“So this is Cyclone 2; the first cyclone being Debbie, Cyclone 1. But we didn’t call it that, we just called it, the weather. So, anyway, you’ve got that, but 2 is kind of like, it’s word play as well, because it plays into 2: Many, like, too many, the words too many, and it says 2 Many Cook, Cook being the cyclone, Cyclone 2, the second one, the current one, the one currently over New Zealand. We might’ve overblown it a little bit, but you know, it’s there, it’s moving.
“So that’s like, a play on, you know, that’s a play on the old saying ‘too many cooks spoil the broth’, which is basically, like, if you have too many people working on one thing it’s just, it’s bad, like if you have, maybe, too many journalists working on the same story or something, it just, it turns out just awful, like maybe really kind of hive-mindy and just a bit hysteric and possibly alarmist or something.
“But instead of being too many cooks spoil the broth, it’s Many Cook – like, much Cook, like lots of the cyclone – spoils the beach, because it wouldn’t spoil a broth. I guess if you left it outside it would, but it’s not mainly doing that. Mainly it’s spoiling the beach, which is where it, you know, which is where it comes ashore.”
Crawford said he hoped audiences would enjoy the name.

"TVNZ measuring strength of storm in different locations by how wet and injured their reporters become
","Weather is a thing that determines what the sky is like.
Tonight, as Cyclone Cook barrels into the East Coast of the upper North Island, TVNZ have stationed more than a dozen reporters in different parts of the country, in an effort to measure the effects of the storm based on how wet and damaged said journalists become.
From Auckland all the way down to Christchurch, TVNZ journalists have been asked to stand still in a single location for the next 12-14 hours, facing a rolling camera, and bear the brunt of their weather environment.
While primetime newsreaders like Simon Dallow and Wendy Petrie have been allowed to stay inside the Auckland studio where they have been confined for the last eight years, many journalists have been deployed as makeshift weather stations.
1 News meteorologist and ghost of a now-deceased funeral home director Dan Corbett said the arrangement was a great way to keep an eye on the storm’s progress “on the fly.”
“So throughout the night we’ll be updating you as the cyclone tracks down the country,” he explained, pointing at a large map of New Zealand. “This is the country, right here. This is what it looks like. And we’ll be able to show you the different kinds of weather it’s bringing to different locations based on what’s happening to our wonderful men and women on the ground.
“For example, here’s Chris Chang. He’s in Tauranga. He’s very, very wet, and he’s begging for a change of clothes. We’re not going to give him any, of course, so there’s a lot of rain there, as you can see.
“Sam Kelway, on the other hand, he’s in Edgecumbe. Not very wet, but he does have bruises all over his face from where tree branches are hitting him. You’ll see there’s one here, here and here. So not so much rain in Edgecumbe, at least not right now, but the winds have been up.”
Will Hine, who is reporting from Whitianga, has had a request to briefly come inside because he was “cold to his bones” declined by Corbett, who said it would damage the integrity of the experiment.
As of this hour, Hines is forcibly restrained on the beach.
Veteran reporter Peter Williams, who was stationed atop Mount Maunganui, has reportedly died.
“Peter really took a beating when the worst of the winds came in late this afternoon,” said Corbett. “So you’ll probably find that’s where it’s at its worst.”

"In bid to ease tensions, Trump authorises firing 59 Pepsi cans at Syrian military base
","A photograph released by the Pentagon shows the Pepsi being shaken vigorously until it launches.
In a dramatic twist in the Syrian conflict, U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the firing of nearly 60 cans of Pepsi at a military installation just south of Homs.
The move comes in response to a horrific chemical attack carried out on civilians by the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which has drawn widespread international condemnation this week.
The extra large 500ml Pepsi cans were fired from a ship stationed in the Mediterranean, and targeted al-Shayrat airbase, from which the chemical weapon attacks are believed to have been launched.
The Pentagon says the US military action today was designed to “ease tensions” and “promote understanding,” and was entirely the President’s idea.
“It was an idea he got from watching TV, yes,” said a Pentagon spokesman. “We can’t elaborate any further as I’m sure you’ll appreciate, but he did say it was something he’d seen on the TV, yes.”
During the 2016 Presidential campaign, then-candidate Trump said he regularly watched television for foreign policy guidance.
“Well, I watch the shows,” he said, when asked where he gets his military advice. “I mean, I really see a lot of great – you know, when you watch your show, and all of the other shows, and you have the generals, and you have certain people.”
The President addressed the nation about the firing of the Pepsi cans just shortly after the news broke at 9pm Eastern Standard Time, speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort.
“This is a wonderful resort,” he said. “Truly wonderful, some say, the best in the world. The golf here is fantastic, you wouldn’t believe it.”
Trump told a 25-minute anecdote about beating Rory McIlroy at golf, before addressing the military strike in more detail, saying “It really is, these chandeliers? You see these chandeliers? Michael, stand back a bit so they can see the chandeliers. There you go. Beautiful, aren’t they?”
He did not take questions.
Syrian military officials have confirmed the strike has killed five and wounded many more, after the victims made the mistake of drinking the Pepsi on offering.

Hello fellow humans.
Thank you for reading my thoughts on your electronic interface. It is a pleasure to be divulging them to you.
While I have been very busy running our country of fellow human beings like me, I have also been taking what the kids call some “time out” to do regular things like you do.
I have cooked for my family. Look at it.

Look at my failure. It is like your failure.
That is not the way pizza is supposed to be. It is not even the way homemade pizza is supposed to be. I am extremely rich, and yet this is the best I can do. I have failed. Like you fail every day. You are all failures.

I have burned the pizza. Look at it.

Look at that burned pizza that would not taste good even were it not burned but now it tastes even worse. I am like you.
Yesterday I went to the dairy. It was not necessary but I am like you. I bought a pack of lollies that was not on the list of things I had to purchase which contained only milk.
This was contrary to my programming. I mean my wife. I mean my instruction manual. I mean my wife’s instructions.
Look at my confused words. They are like your confused words when you are caught in a lie by your boss or speak to a person you are scouting for sexual activity.

"Tararua Mayor says rain falling at a 61 degree angle to total accumulation of 17.2mm on a Thursday is ‘one in 1,000 year event’
","The town of Dannevirke hasn’t seen rain precisely like this on a Thursday for at least a thousand years.
While Whakatane deals with catastrophic flooding from what media are calling a one in 500 year event (following last week’s one in 100 year event, and last year’s one in 200 year event), the town of Dannevirke is dealing with a historic deluge of its own.*
Tracey Collins, the mayor of Tararua District where Dannevirke is located, says that the town has received exactly 17.2mm of rain at a 61 degree angle, which, being on a Thursday, marks a one in 1,000 year rainfall event.
“Certainly that exact accumulation as measured on Tennyson Street is the first time this has happened – on a Thursday – for at least a millennium,” she said, at a hastily arranged press conference this evening. “When you take into account the angle of the rainfall, of course. If you don’t, then it might look less significant.”
Collins said she wanted to make the media aware of what she thought would make a “great headline,” because it “sounds big.”
She also didn’t want the flooding of a significant portion of the town of Edgecumbe to “take away” from “what’s going on here.”
“Make no mistake, it doesn’t rain like this every day,” she said, pointing to some light drizzle out the window. “Bruce’s Volkswagen is wet.”
“That it is!” clarified Bruce, a local. “Wetter than average.”
Tararua District Council had not called for any evacuations “as yet”, but have volunteers visiting people door to door to ask them how their magnolias are doing.
Prime Minister Bill English has declined to declare a national state of emergency in Dannevirke, but says he is “monitoring” the situation.
Collins accepted that, saying she was “pleased” someone was paying attention and “listening to me speak.”
This news comes after Greymouth Mayor Tony Kokshoorn said his West Coast town was also bearing the brunt of ex-cyclone Debbie, with Greymouth experiencing a challenging one in several days event.

"Quick tips: Six fun ways you can prevent terrorism at home
","There sure is a lot of terror in the world today. It’s hard to turn on our television sets without seeing people running for their lives or police putting cordons around things. There was even that train crash on Coronation Street recently.
Yes, it’s enough to convince anyone that the world has gone entirely to shit. You can’t even walk down the street to buy bread anymore without being blown up or beheaded by an ISIS militant.
If you haven’t taken your kids out of school already, you’re a fool.
But there is good news. Despite all the turmoil in the world, there are still things you can do and valuable actions you take to ensure the safety of you, your family, and the entirety of Western civilization. And believe it or not, it can even be fun!
We’ve put together a list of six simple steps you can take to prevent terrorism at home.
 
 1. Avoid becoming involved in the plotting or execution of acts of terror
This is very important. Unlike in the past, acts of terrorism are no longer extremely coordinated operations that flow from a chain of command in unstable regions of the world.
Most terror today is home grown; people becoming self-radicalized watching television or browsing the internet. There’s a fine line between watching The Kardashians or The Bachelor and wanting to wreak untold destruction on all of humanity. It’s a slippery slope.
If you want to avoid becoming radicalized, it’s best not to listen to anyone, and avoid the consumption of media. You never know when someone could get inside your head with an idea you didn’t put there. Anything could radicalize you; even this article is dangerous. Stop reading it right now.
 
 2. Be vigilant, but don’t discriminate. It’s not just Muslims
It’s also the Irish.
As well as keeping an eye on your Muslim neighbours, make sure to keep an even closer eye on your Irish neighbours. You might think you know them, and you might dismiss them as adorable wee folk from a quaint land across the sea.
But make no mistake, the Irish have done untold damage to British infrastructure throughout the ages, and while they haven’t attacked for over a decade, this is likely to mean the next one’s going to be big.
 
 3. Plan a terror attack of your own to get an idea of what a real terrorist might do
When being vigilant, it helps to know what a terrorist might be up to in the course of a terror attack. That way you can cut them off and prevent them from executing the next step in their plan.
This is why you should think about extensively planning your own attack.
Visit a local landmark and take pictures of security cameras, security personnel, or any points of weakness the site or structure might have. Ask guards and police where they think the best place to plant a bomb might be.
 
 4. Stock weapons and perhaps a large vehicle
After you’ve done conducting extensive surveillance of the hypothetical target and posted the pictures around your bedroom wall, the next step you’ll want to take is to acquire heavy weapons and a large vehicle, preferably a truck or bus.
You can often help prevent terror by buying up the resources the real terrorists will want.
 
 5. Write a suicide note
You’re going to need this, because you’re probably not coming back. You’ll want to put a political statement in this. Perhaps you’re upset about US and British incursion into the Middle East. Maybe you’re still angry that Northern Ireland still belongs to the empire. Or perhaps you’re just really teed off that you pay $56 a month for Sky Sport’s streaming service which only provides you channels 1 to 4, and then they put a live event on a pop-up channel that you can’t access while running nothing but highlights on Sky Sport 1.
All of these are equally legitimate causes.
 
6. Conduct your terror attack
You’ve planned it, you’ve acquired the resources, built an IED, and become unwittingly radicalized. There’s only one thing left to do now: carry out your meticulously planned terror attack and aim for as much chaos and destruction as possible; the damage you can do in a short period without dying is the difference between an attack that will be forgotten in days and one that will go down in history.",NaN,31/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/civilianterrortipsfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Opinion: These bloody ambulances think they own the road. We’ve all got somewhere to be
","By Sir Bob Jones.
I don’t drive anymore. I don’t need to. I’ve got immigrants to do that for me.
Also I’m not allowed to, ever since the bloody nanny state confiscated my license for driving drunk up State Highway 2.
That’s nonsense. I don’t drink anymore. Two bottles of red a day, not enough to get me drunk.
But this is the way things are today. The coddlers and the moralisers who we made fun of in the 80s for wearing brown shoes and growing hair on their faces own us now. They dictate every bloody thing we do. We’ve all gone mad, and those of us who aren’t totally emasculated are asked to humiliate ourselves and take childish precautions in the name of safety.
She was a woman, of course. The woman who took my license. They always are. I’d like to see her drive.
Even if I had been drunk, what does it matter? I could still see.
They think we’re children, these people; nothing but grown-up children who can’t handle a vehicle after just three bottles of Johnnie Walker Black.
It’s all immaterial, of course. I’m glad I can’t drive anymore. In Wellington, you get places faster on foot, even at my age. And I’ll tell you one thing that’s not making it any easier: ambulances.
Who do these bloody ambulances think they are, screaming up and down the road, making a hell of a noise, and getting in the way of traffic? What makes them so entitled? We’ve all got somewhere to be. I’ve got to be in Aspen in 6 hours, and this flight attendant is threatening to turn back the plane if I don’t stop smoking my pipe and putting it out on the kid next to me.
If ambulances want to use the road they should have to obey the rules like the rest of us, and all these people pulling over for them are just encouraging them.
I’ve never pulled over for an ambulance, and if they try that on me, I make sure to block them. The light is red. Just bloody wait.
I’ve heard people suggest that we need ambulances to do this, but I can’t for the life of me see why.
I’ve never needed an ambulance, and I suspect people do don’t deserve one. If I ever injure myself, bring me a bottle of Sherry before you do me the indignity of calling me an ambulance.
If you’ve ever called for an ambulance, you should be ashamed of yourself. If you can’t just get on with it, you might as well just die anyway, and good bloody riddance to the lot of you.",NaN,30/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bobjonesambulancesfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Serious Fraud Office investigating ring of serial fraudsters pretending to be All Blacks so they can take photos with tourists
","An unwitting tourist with cultural facemask takes a picture with a man he sincerely believes to be an All Black.
In what the serious fraud office is describing as a “truly sick” case of stolen valour, a group of young but well-bodied men are travelling around New Zealand posing with tourists, pretending they’re real All Blacks.
While some tourists were immediately suspicious after not being able to identify the men, others were caught totally unawares, gleefully taking pictures with who they variously identified as Aaron Smith, Richie McCaw, and Jonah Lomu.
A spokesperson for the SFO said that while the men might’ve thought what they were doing was funny, the reality was it was “anything but.”
“Hundreds of peoples’ lives have been irreparably damaged by their actions, actions they cannot now take back,” he said. “These tourists, innocently thinking they were taking a picture with a famous All Black, have in many cases been horrified to find their prized picture featured nothing more than a random guy in an albeit-expensive All Blacks shirt.
“During our investigation, we have had to tell countless people ‘No, I’m afraid that’s not Ma’a Nonu,’ or ‘No, that’s not Jonah Lomu, he’s dead.’
“The look on their faces is enough to break your heart.”
One victim of the serial All Black impersonators, Luke George, said he was left distraught and penniless by their malicious actions.
“I was just out with my friends,” he recalls. “You know, Friday night, Queenstown, down for the weekend. We got pretty drunk, not going to lie. We were on our way back to the hostel, and this guy, we just stumble across this guy, and his friend, and he’s tall, like, he’s really tall. He’s wearing an All Blacks jersey and he really looks the part.
“And he’s just like ‘Hey, you recognise me, aye?’ And we’re like ‘Holy shit! It’s him, it’s that fuckin’ one, from the game.’ And he’s like ‘It’s okay guys, you can take a photo,’ so we ran up to him and we all got a photo with him, one by one. We were just so star struck, you know?”
George said it was only when he got back home and showed the picture to some of his older friends that he realised what had happened.
“I was just devastated,” he said. “I felt like such a fucking idiot. It wasn’t whatsitsface at all, it was just some guy.”
This began an ongoing spiral of depression for George, who said he felt violated by the experience. He lost his job, his girlfriend, and became an alcoholic.
The Serious Fraud Office says it’s cases like these that concern them the most.
“That kind of power in the wrong hands is a very dangerous thing,” said the SFO spokesperson. “There are men that fight hard to put on that jersey, devote their whole lives so they can earn the right to go around taking pictures with hapless idiots outside bars, and if we let just anyone do that, we may see the incentive to be an All Black evaporate altogether.”",NaN,25/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stolenblackvalourfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake

","Picture not representative of actual test cricket attendance.
Today, the Black Caps begin Day 1 of their final match ever. After a series of recent performances, the team has unanimously agreed to disband forever, and just go back to their normal lives. Follow along throughout the day as we provide live updates and commentary from Seddon Park in Hamilton.
New updates posted the top, so be sure to check back often, and read from the bottom up!
South Africa – 1st Innings – 123/4

4:51pm: It’s stopped raining at the ground but there still won’t be any play as, according to match officials, the rain has made things wet.
4:22pm: Wait, never mind. That was a highlight from a different game. Still raining.
22.1: de Grandhomme to du Plessis. He drives on the up, straight to Kane Williamson, who takes the catch! He’s gone!
4:02pm: Rain is a part of every great test match, and rest assured, Hamilton dishes up rain like the best of them. The rain here at Seddon Park is truly ideal rain for a ground like this. These are perfect playing conditions for not playing in, and a jubilant crowd of 14 agrees.
41.0: The dark spectre of racism has returned and the shadow has brought about horrific memories of the Apartheid regime that have scared the South Africans off the ground. Neil Wagner seems unperturbed, wanting to play on, but Oxenford and Tucker have called players off the field.
We’ll return in about 20 minutes to commentate rain.
38.2: Spectators at the ground left in the dark as TV viewers learn where Ian Smith gets his pizza from when he stays in Hamilton.
37.1: Commentary box has now gone a full three minutes without discussing how short Bavuma is. Awkward tension building over who will bring it up again.
33.5: de Grandhomme to Amla. Swings in and Amla misjudges it worse than his own facial hair. He’s gone, and Kane breathes a sigh of relief; he doesn’t have to do anything for another 20 overs.
Enter Temba Bavuma.
32.0: Amla brings up his 50. Neil Wagner approaches Williamson to ask if maybe they should try something different than the seven pre-set fields from Cricket for Dummies.
“Nah,” says Kane. “This is fine.”
31.0: Kane returns to the field, shaking his head and shrugging at his men. It’s bad news.
30.1: Kane Williamson has left the field. It is believed he’s asking coach Mike Hesson to strip him of the captaincy.
28.5: We’re back, and Kane has demanded another review he doesn’t have. Wagner to du Plessis. Straight off the middle of the bat. Bruce Oxenford refers the decision upstairs out of sympathy, and once again, not out. To be fair to the New Zealanders, it may have been, if the ICC had implemented the much-discussed bat-before-wicket rule.
Lunch – Day 1: Boy, what a morning we’ve had. There was some real cricket that happened, which is great, because that’s the game we’re playing. Kane Williamson really stuffed the toss, and has already used both New Zealand’s reviews, one to overturn a decision in his favour. That’s just the kind of great leader he is.
It’s really hard to pick highlights from that first session, as there weren’t any.
26.4: Light drizzle threatens the playing condition of Kane Williamson’s fragile beard, so we’re taking an early lunch here at Seddon Park, the possible birthplace of Richard Seddon.
24.2: Bruce Oxenford and Rod Tucker discuss whether to call an early lunch because they’re bored.
23.4: Henry to Duminy. Distracted by the ever-looming spectre of racism, Duminy attempts slashing at it with his bat. Top-edges the ball and it doesn’t go high enough, instead being caught by Jeetan Patel at fine leg.
A tragic tale like so many before his; in an attempt to take on racism, he’s accidentally picked out the Indian. Shame on you, JP Duminy.
The captain, Faf du Plessis, takes to the field.
22.0: Dark cloud begins to loom over the ground. Umpires looking concerned, but groundsmen assure them it’s not rain, but rather the dark spectre of racism that plagues the future of our world.
21.2: Quick tip for young cricketers: it takes only 10 no balls to incapacitate an entire opponent’s batting lineup.
20.0: With 20 overs passed, Amla is on 28, Duminy 19, and New Zealand selectors pat themselves on the back, telling each other that 53/2 would be a “quite bad” T20 score.
17.4: Kane attempts to waste another review, but is told he has none left.
14.3: We have entered the slow early-middle-overs period of the day where commentators have begun talking about where they went for dinner last night, and whose outdoor barbeque setup is best.
10.1: Neil Wager to JP Duminy. Ball angles in and crashes into his pads on about middle stump. Looks out. Umpire gives him. He’s gone! New Zealand celebrates. Kane mistakes celebration for appeal. Kane reviews the out decision.
3rd Umpire says not out. Decision overturned. Duminy stays.
6.4: Henry half-a-ball to Amla. Ball hits the pitch and just sits there. Cries of frustration from the field. Kane Williamson in gully misinterprets and calls for a review.
3rd Umpire says not out.
6.2: Awkward scenes as meth-affected umpires refuse to acknowledge the need for a new ball. “Looks fine to me,” says Bruce Oxenford, holding half a ball in his hand. Matt Henry forced to continue bowling with half a ball.
3.1: de Grandhomme to Elgar. de Grandhomme cleverly splits the ball in two upon release. One half swings outward. Elgar nicks it to the keeper. The other half clips off stump and Elgar has lost two wickets in one delivery. He won’t be allowed to bat next innings.
JP Duminy to the middle.
2.1: Stephen Cook is swiftly unmasked after an outside edge carries to Tom Latham in the slips. Latham knows how to take such catches early in an innings because he is himself an expert at placing those shots.
Hashim Amla comes out to the middle roughly when he expected to.
0.0: Dean Elgar will open the batting along with Stephen Cook in disguise with a clearly fake name “TB de Bruyn” – a blatant attempt to circumvent his deselection.
—————————————————————————————-
11:19am: Coin has landed and killed a spectator by passing through his entire body at incredible speed. South Africa have won the toss, and will bat first.
11:13am: Coin still hasn’t come down. Faf du Plessis has offered to lose the toss by default so the game can commence, but Kane has declined.
11:10am: Ten minutes later, the toss is still ongoing after Kane Williamson flipped the coin too hard and it got caught in an updraft, sending it high into the upper-atmosphere.
10:45am: Umpires Bruce Oxenford and Rod Tucker have just spent the last several minutes snorting the field, and say they feel “fucking excellent.”
The toss will occur at 11am.
10:30am: No rain, but the toss has been delayed this morning following methamphetamine contamination of the outfield.
Hamilton’s own Simon Doull says not to worry, as this isn’t unusual for the ground.
“You do get a little bit of this in Hamilton,” he says. “Par for the course, really. When the wind blows in from the North, you get a little bit of that – what we call P spray – just coming in over the hills. It’ll linger for a while, and a few people will get high – possibly permanently addicted – and then it’ll clear, and we should be able to get on with the game.”

"Today in History: The time Bill English lost the election because he got carried away and had half a beer on St. Patrick’s Day
","The Prime Minister’s unfortunate history with alcohol should be a lesson to us all this Saint Patrick’s Day.
It was March of 2002.
Then-not-Prime Minister Bill English had only recently inherited the leadership of the National Party, having wrestled it from Jenny Shipley in a brutal and unforgiving game of lawn bowls.
His goal now was to do the improbable, and unseat a relatively composed first term Labour Government.
Everything was going somewhat to plan, until one fatal campaign misstep sent his career and his party into a state of total disarray.
English was seeking to raise his profile ahead of the election, and establish himself as a likable, no-nonsense country boy who would be an acceptable alternative to another three years of Labour.
Saint Patrick’s Day seemed like the perfect opportunity to mingle at some Christchurch bars and capture the attention of the all-important Irish Cantabrian bloc of swing-voters.
It couldn’t have gone worse.
What started out as a fairly regular evening devolved into debauchery after English was egged on to drink roughly half a light beer. At first he refused, cracking jokes with the locals that it would be a “bad look” for a future Prime Minister*.
(*How he knew that far in advance he’d accidentally inherit the job from John Key is still a contentious topic amongst Bill English historians)
After a while, though, the pressure began to build.
One drunk Irish local told English he was a “sissy” and another said “fuck you John English.”
Several  told the National leader they wouldn’t vote for him if he didn’t have a “cheeky wee chug” of the golden temptress.
Afraid of losing votes, English reluctantly spent the next two hours lightly sipping exactly half the watered-down extra light 1.3% alcohol beverage until he had completed it.
This was the first time he’d drunk alcohol in more than 30 years, and it went straight to his head.
English began laughing louder than he should’ve , told another man he was “dressed well” – which was roundly perceived as a homosexual comment – and ultimately ended up telling an off-colour joke that carried reference to urination.
When news broke in the media, conservative Christians were horrified with English’s behaviour, and abandoned him in droves.
English and the party were forced to apologise, but it was already too late; he had been condemned by every Christian church leader in the country, with the exception of Father George Beverly, who was later convicted of child molestation.
National wound up with a disastrous total of 20.9% of the vote, its lowest in history.
English won’t soon forget this mistake, and it’s likely why he’ll be spending this Saint Patrick’s Day inside with a bottle of grape juice and a family movie about a dog and the neat things it can do.",NaN,17/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/englishdrinkingfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Mike Hosking finally done adjusting his sleeves
","New Zealand media will never be the same: Mike Hosking has finally achieved the perfect fold on his sleeves.
After several long years, Seven Sharp host Mike Hosking has finally finished adjusting his sleeves, feeling he’s got them “just right” for the moment.
Last night on the show, Hosking suddenly interrupted a segment about children making their own toys out of peanut butter to tell co-host Toni Street about his momentous accomplishment.
“Hold it there,” he said. “I’m sorry, I can’t allow this to go on. Can we stop this segment? Have we stopped it? Good. Okay, I did it.”
“You did what?” asked Street.
“I got it.”
There was silence.
“The sleeves, Toni,” he clarified. “I think I’ve got my sleeves right.”
“Oh,” replied Street, as a producer quietly asked if they should resume playing the peanut butter segment. “Is that important?”
“Of course it’s important, they said I couldn’t do it.”
“Who said you couldn’t do it?”
“The fitters, at the shop, when I bought the wrong size.”
It was a long time coming for Hosking, whose last successful sleeve adjustment was ruined after he brushed past Peter Williams in the hallway mere minutes later.
“This is why I’m number one and your career is over,” Hosking told him at the time.
Now that Hosking has finished adjusting his sleeves, he will spend the next several years undoing and redoing his belt on a different notch.",NaN,15/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hoskingsleevesfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Gender bias: How would audiences respond differently if Trump was a washing machine and Clinton was a can opener?
","A New York University experiment has found that – perhaps unexpectedly – Trump was even more likable as a home appliance.
The traditional wisdom – as held in academic circles – is that gender played a significant role in the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election.
The thinking goes that Donald Trump’s brash and obnoxious braggadocio was only tolerated because he was a man, and Hillary Clinton’s poise, experience and nuance was largely dismissed by many voters because of her gender.
But what if it had been different? What if instead of being a man, Trump had been a washing machine? And instead of being a woman, what if Clinton had been a can opener?
Only by asking this specific question can we begin to understand the gender dynamics at play. Would Trump have been seen more negatively had he spun around mercilessly making a horrendous noise? And would Hillary Clinton have come off as more likable if she could help you open things like tomato soup or a nice cold one?
An experiment by theatre students at NYU sought answers to these questions by re-enacting the entire first presidential debate, with Donald Trump played by a washing machine and Hillary Clinton played by a can opener.
The results were revealing.
Contrary to expectations, audiences found Clinton even less likable, saying things like “it’s just a can opener” and “it’s not anything, it’s just sitting there, I really didn’t find it convincing.”
Trump, on the other hand, received more positive reviews.
His loud whirling and clanging at the peak of his spin cycle really resonated with the audience, who felt he articulated their political views “perfectly.”
“He really had his finger on the pulse,” said one attendee. “When he said WURR WURR WURR WURR BANG BANG BANG BANG, you know, that’s really how I feel about most political issues these days.”
Trump also came off as more “personable”, they said, as he slowly walked towards the audience due to vibration.
The experiment has been criticised for casting items too similar to the actual candidates.",NaN,15/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trumpwashingmachinefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"All natural: how the ancient Aztecs drank chia seed smoothies from their local wankshop
","An ancient Aztec health shop owner dispenses patented health foods to his well-nourished customers.
At this time of year, many of us are feeling the need to improve our diet following a long summer of binge drinking, overeating, drinking again in the morning to avoid a hangover, and waking up shitfaced in the middle of the road next to a dead animal of a species no longer distinguishable by its horrifically mutilated carcass.
Being healthier is never easy, especially when KFC is giving away the chicken they dropped on the floor earlier in the day for just a few dollars after 11pm, but now more than ever, it’s surprisingly simple to maintain a diet that will make you thinner, healthier and happier.
Did you know that the main reason humans get sick at all is because we put things in our body we didn’t used to when human civilization was young? Properly treated tap water, medicine and antivenom for snake bites are just several of the things that ancient civilizations never had, which is why they were much healthier than we are today.
That’s why people all across New Zealand and the world are increasingly adopting traditional diets, eating only ancient foods that have been consumed for millennia, such as low-carb gluten-free fruit cake, carob brownies, and smoothies with grass in them.
This is how the ancient Aztecs ate.
Did you know that in the ancient Aztec Empire, people would flock to their local holistic wankshops in droves to partake in a late afternoon chia seed smoothie? Sometimes these shops would be so overrun with customers that those who came in too late would be forced to buy brown rice sushi instead!
Yes, the Aztecs were one with nature, and regularly looked at the sky, which is a thing people used to be able to see.
If you follow what ancient peoples ate, you can’t go wrong, because their diets were naturally tailored to their genetics, rather than bizarre quirks of culture with no scientific basis.
So if a chia seed smoothie doesn’t work out for you, consider other things the Aztecs would’ve eaten, such as each other.",NaN,13/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ancientaztecfeature-1-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Council warns if Aucklanders don’t use less water, they’ll face the possibility of still having water
","Watercare’s Mark Bourne warns Aucklanders that if they don’t personally conserve water, someone else more conscientious will do it for them.
Auckland City Council and Watercare have warned Auckland residents today that if they don’t use considerably less water over the next month, they may be forced to continue providing them water.
“We’re asking Auckland residents to reduce their water consumption by about 20 litres a day,” said Mark Bourne, spokesman for Watercare. “If they don’t, they will likely continue to see water delivered to their homes as usual.”
Continued water supply would be of less quality, and some residents may be asked to boil their water before use, but it would “still be there” and return to normal “pretty swiftly.”
“Ultimately, you either use less water now, or you’ll use less water later when you actually have to, so it’ll all work out the same either way,” he said. “The only difference I guess is it’s a problem for you if you have to use less water now, and it becomes a problem for us if you don’t.
But for you nothing will change.”
Bourne said he couldn’t “just cut off” the water if Aucklanders used too much, so “Eh.”
For those who are confused about how to save exactly 20 litres of water a day, Watercare is suggesting that residents fill roughly two standard buckets of water from their tap, put them aside, and don’t use them.",NaN,10/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/savewateraucklandfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake

I find this offensive. I’m not being disingenuous. The me you hear from in public or speaking to the camera is exactly the same kind of robotic narcissist I am in private, and with my family.

"Quick tips: 13 subtle signs your house may be flooded and you need to evacuate
","As rainfall brings torrential flooding to much of the upper North Island today, and many homes find themselves under threat, Civil Defence has issued a series of guidelines about how to know when your house is flooded and when you should leave.
We’ve created a helpful summary of those guidelines, and compressed them into 13 compelling signs that your house is flooded and you need to evacuate.
If more than 3 of these is true of your house, you should consider evacuating, and if more than 5 are true, you should evacuate immediately.
 
 1. There’s water everywhere
Boy oh boy, this is a big one. If there’s water everywhere – and we mean everywhere – in places you wouldn’t even typically expect water to be, such as your lungs, then you might have a flood on your hands.
Don’t just dismiss it as bad plumbing. It could very well be something worse.
 
 2. When you walk around your house, you feel water lapping at your ankles or above
This can be an easy one to miss, but without being too paranoid, ask yourself if you feel a gentle lapping of water at your knees or other parts of your legs or body. If you do, it could be because flood waters have filled your home.
You might also feel that walking is more difficult, or you may encounter more resistance than you’re used to when moving.
 
 3. You go to make some toast for breakfast, but the toaster has floated into a different room
This might take you until tomorrow morning to test, but if you’re the kind of person who likes toast for breakfast, just check to see if your toaster is in the same place it normally is. If it’s become inadvertently moored to your bedroom wall, it might have floated there due to flooding.
 
 4. When you open your front door, water uncontrollably gushes into your house
Try opening your front door. If you find you can’t without muddy water uncontrollably gushing into your hallway like some kind of river rapid, there’s a chance you’re experiencing a flood.
 
 5. Your shower is full
Unlike baths, showers don’t usually get full. If your shower is totally full to the brim like your bath would be, then you’re experiencing flooding, and your bath is likely to be full as well.
Taking out the plug might provide some temporary relief, but it will ultimately take a bit more than that.
 
 6. There’s a live dolphin in your living room
That’s not normal.
 
 7. The image on your television set has lost its sharpness and looks extremely murky
If you notice a distinct murkiness suddenly develop on your television set, to the point where images only appear as vague globs of colour, this could be caused by the interference of water between your eyes and your television set.
If your eyes are in pain and you feel you can’t breathe, this explanation becomes even more likely.
 
 8. The ceiling seems closer than usual and you can’t feel the floor beneath your feet
Hard to get through doorways without diving? Finding your face pressed against the ceiling or dangerously close to the chandelier? Ask yourself if you can feel the ground beneath your feet. If you can’t, this might be because you’re floating in a sea of muddy water and debris.
 
 9. There are dead fish in your bed
It’s even worse if they’re alive.
 
 10. A boat has crashed through the ceiling of your home
It depends on the size of the boat, but if it’s large enough and travelling fast enough to destroy at least one room in your house, there’s a good chance it only got there because you’re now part of a busy sea route.
 
 11. All your food tastes really watery
If you’re eating Wattie’s soup range or anything from a Maggi packet, discount this one.
 
 12. The jug is boiling your entire home
You’ve settled in for the evening, turned on the jug, and you’re looking forward to a nice hot cuppa, but instead of boiling just the contents of the jug, it’s slowly boiling your whole house, and you alive with it.
It’s recommended you turn off your jug before you leave, lest it boil the whole floodzone and beyond.
 
 13. You see Gerry Brownlee floating past your house
Look out your window. If you see Civil Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee floating down your street on either his stomach or his back, you are definitely in a flood zone. Brownlee is regularly deployed as a kind of raft to help residents leave their flooded homes.
Remember, if 1 to 3 of the above is true, it may just be coincidence, but if you’re experiencing more than that, you probably have a flood on your hands. The more you know.",NaN,08/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/floodingtipsfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Government to shorten superannuation period by encouraging New Zealanders to live two years less long
","English said he wasn’t suggesting people actively kill themselves, but perhaps “smoke” and “drink” more.
In the latest of a steady flow of election year announcements, Prime Minister Bill English has confirmed today what had long been suspected; that his government will seek to shorten the superannuation period by two years, not by increasing the age, but by encouraging New Zealanders to die a little earlier.
In a post-cabinet press conference this afternoon, English asked those approaching retirement age to think “long and hard” about whether they really wanted to live out the final few years of their lives.
“From a fiscal point of view, this change makes sense,” he said. “So we’re asking New Zealanders to think – from a fiscal point of view – what really is the return on investment for living 2, maybe even 3, years longer? The Government thinks, in light of a need to expand the super base without incurring unsustainable cost, the answer is ‘not much’, frankly.”
English asked New Zealanders to think of their deceased relatives, and what the last two years of their lives were like.
“I think, generally speaking, they wouldn’t be the best two,” he said. “In fact, I think you’d say you wished they’d just hurried up and died two years earlier.”
The Prime Minister said he understood there were some “nuances” in determining when two years before one’s death would be, and promised the Government would set up a “helpful online resource” for calculating your likely natural date of death.
“We can then set you up with notifications, direct to your phone, to tell you when perhaps it’s best to call it a day.”
The Government would even propose an alternative to ending your own life, and if you felt you didn’t want to voluntarily depart from this world a little sooner, you could always leave the country and become an unsightly burden on another nation’s economy.
“Perhaps you don’t want to die,” said English. “We certainly respect that. We just ask that you go somewhere else and become their problem instead.”
“You’ve got lots of options,” he assured. “Well, two.”
Grand Elder and Retired Services Chiefton Winston Peters of the Graycloak has already come out strongly against the measure, saying the elderly are a boon to our economy, not a burden.
“Of course these career politicians who’ve never worked a day in their lives are going to prattle on about the elderly being some kind of a burden,” he said. “My retired constituents, every one of them, has contributed more to the economy than [the Prime Minister’s] ugly mug.”
Peters insisted the elderly had sharp minds, were focused, and that he’d go into the mine himself.",NaN,06/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/superagefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Power outage allows man to rediscover joy of walking around in circles aimlessly
","Thousands of South Island customers were left without power today, allowing them to rediscover the joys of sitting silently just praying it would all be over soon.
A South Island-wide power outage today turned out to be a blessing in disguise for one Christchurch man who says it allowed him to find the time to rediscover his love of walking around aimlessly with no idea what to do with himself.
Christopher Leon, 32, said he was left in a state of total disarray when power went out to much of the city at around 11:20am this morning. But after an initial moment of panic, he found himself doing something he hadn’t done in years: aimlessly wandering to and from the kitchen to check if the fridge light was on yet.
“It just allowed me to get away from all the distractions and spend some quality time with myself, just wandering around aimlessly wondering when the power would come back on,” he said. “It’s one of those things you rarely get a chance to do in this modern world we live in. I really found myself in those moments, and what I learned is that, actually, I’m really boring.
“When all the technology stops and you’re left not even able to toast a slice of bread, it really brings into focus everything you have in your life. Which is nothing, really. Everything just stops.”
“Without technology, I have nothing to add to this world,” he added. “Nothing at all.”
Christopher said it felt like a lifetime before the power came back on, but in that time he learned a very valuable lesson about humans’ over-reliance on technology.
“We really need it,” he said. “Life is fucking terrible without power.”
Christopher says he plans on buying a backup power generator so that he is never forced to confront who he really is ever again.",NaN,02/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/poweroutagefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Talented rising star finally presented with career-ending noose she always wanted
","The rope used to tie Jacinda Ardern to the political career of Andrew Little is reportedly “incredibly thick”, and if she begins to have second thoughts, conventional tools like scissors and garden shears “simply won’t work.”
A young and talented rising star of the Labour Party has finally achieved her dreams today, being formally presented with the thankless burden of an institutional noose that will gradually tighten and surely end her career permanently.
Jacinda Ardern was officially handed the noose by Labour leader Andrew Little earlier today, after long-time noose-wearer Annette King decided to finally call it quits.
King has worn the noose for a total of six years since 2008, and has ruled out ever doing so again, saying she will retire from politics entirely at the election, due to troubles with a “sore neck.”
At a press conference this afternoon, Little – whose own neck is attached to the other end of the noose – did the honours of tying it around Jacinda Ardern’s throat, before praising her as a “vital injection of energy” into “this cruel career death pact.”
“This will do nicely,” he said, securing the knot, as Ardern appeared emotionally overcome by the moment.
“It is such an honour,” she told reporters, as the leadership duo now stood separated only by three metres of rope. “But more than that, I take this very seriously. I believe I’m up to the job, and ready to tie myself to Andrew in ways that can only benefit him.”
Little echoed that sentiment, saying he was “thrilled” to have Ardern aboard, and couldn’t wait to drag her down to his level in ways she could never recover from.
“This is a partnership,” he said. “It’s not about me. It’s not about Jacinda. If I go down in a political ball of flames, so will she.”
Annette King is tonight denying rumours that the rope was forcibly removed from her neck, saying the decision was hers, and she “just got sick of sleeping on the floor next to Andrew’s bed.”
Prime Minister Bill English sought to dismiss Ardern’s inheritance of the noose today, saying she was “untested”, and that he had far more experience, having worn a career-ending noose for a whole 15 years.",NaN,01/03/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jacindanoosefeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Starved tigers and bears to be introduced to New Zealand as bio-control measure against humans
","Biosecurity experts say humans are naturally susceptible to repeated maulings.
The Ministry for Primary Industries is seeking approval this week to introduce starved and angry tigers and bears to New Zealand’s ecosystem as a bio-control measure to curb the increasingly problematic human population.
MPI says the biosecurity threat caused by humans has become “alarming” in recent years, but that a solution to the problem need not be complicated.
It has applied to the Environmental Protection Agency to import some of the most violent and aggressive species of bear and tiger from around the world, and release them into populous urban centres.
Police and other authorities will be instructed not to interfere with the animals while they are feeding or otherwise engaging in “pre-emptive self-defence.”
“Our plan obviously isn’t to eradicate the human population,” said one MPI spokesperson. “We just want to control it, and keep it to a more manageable number.”
Human beings are a bipedal species of primate that have caused untold damage to New Zealand for last several hundred years, but are highly susceptible to savage and repeat maulings.
Tigers and bears aren’t the only biosecurity option available to reduce New Zealand’s human population. If MPI is denied the authority to import bears and tigers, its back-up plan is to instead seek to introduce other, different kinds of humans.",NaN,24/02/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tigersbearsstory-300x161.jpg,Fake

This is nonsense, this stuff the Government’s going on about now with this bloody water, cleaner water, better water, swimmable water. I know it’s election year but grow a bloody spine for Christ’s sake, and stop pandering to this namby pamby crowd. I mean it’s infantile.
They’re never going to vote for you anyway. Anybody with a mind to care about this sort of rubbish is only going to vote for those bastards with the disgraceful face paintings and emasculated, 12-year-old looking creatures that call themselves men wearing brown shoes with trimmed beards, as though that makes the act of wearing hair on your face any less puerile.
How old are we, really? I don’t care about the bloody water, and neither does anyone in New Zealand, and if they tell you they do, they’re a damned liar.
I drank some water once. It wasn’t any good. I haven’t had a glass of water for twenty years, and look at me: I’m drunk.
Of course, I don’t drink anymore. Just wine, and six glasses of Bristol Cream Sherry a day to keep the blood flowing, but other than that, it’s just gin and whisky.
Look at the Mediterranean peoples. They survived for decades without water, all they drunk was wine, and what harm did it do them? None. They probably had a swim in it, too. And if the baby’s crying and dehydrated, no need to give it water; pump it full of pinot, and if you’re lucky it’ll get brain damage and die.
Nobody wants children, I regret all of mine, the ones I can remember.
What on earth gets in people’s heads that we’re worried about the quality of our waterways, anyway? Whose idea was this? It’s just madness, this stuff.
People’ll drink anything with a label, and they’ll swim in anything. Chlorine, piss, doesn’t matter.
I was in Prague one time and my wife and I ordered a glass of water. It was black, but we drank it. Mind you, she died, but it was nothing I couldn’t replace.
We’ve become coddled, this society, and we’ve got to be wary of these people, these environmental types who tell us what water to swim in or what cars we can drive or this sort of thing.
Next thing they’ll be telling me if I find a homeless person on my property I have to let him live.
If these people are so concerned about water quality – and I suspect most of them are women, as they often are – we should take some of this swimmable water, hook it up to a fireman’s hose, and blast it up their arse until they explode.

"Government vows that by 2040, 90% of New Zealand’s rivers will be ‘vaguely liquid in nature’
","Environment Minister Nick Smith says the country’s rivers will “almost universally” be swimmable by 2040, but urges New Zealander’s not to drink from them “under any circumstances.”
The National Government has fronted up with a bold election year commitment today, with Environment Minister Nick Smith saying that new targets will see 90% of New Zealand’s rivers attain a vaguely liquid consistency by the year 2040, down from the current 95%.
At a West Auckland press conference, Smith and the Prime Minister, Bill English, jointly announced the policy, saying that it would be an “extraordinary” achievement to keep the percentage of our rivers and streams that are liquid above 89% more than 20 years from now.
“We think that’d be pretty good,” said English. “You have to put that in perspective. That’s only a 5% or so decline in liquid rivers over a period of 23 years.”
He said that the Government would be working hard over the coming decade to ensure New Zealand’s rivers “don’t all deteriorate into a kind of solid brown sludge.”
“We anticipate that 90% or so of rivers will have some kind of liquid in them, somewhere,” he added. “Digging a little to get it should be no problem for good-spirited, outgoing kiwi families.”
Some of the new targets would also be achieved by redefining the Environment Ministry’s definition of a “swimmable river.”
“What we’re saying is, that, for too long, the definition you or I might have of swimmable, is not consistent with the Government’s definition of swimmable,” he explained. “You might see a river, like this river behind me, and say ‘well that’s swimmable, it’s water, I could swim in that’, and that’s just common sense. What you might not know, is the Environment Ministry would define it as not swimmable, just because you have a high chance of getting a campylobacter infection.”
“Campylobacter has nothing to do with swimming,” added Nick Smith. “The way we see it, if you can paddle your arms about and get some movement, that’s swimmable.”
Smith said it was even possible that some rivers classified as not wadeable could still qualify as swimmable.
“It’s much easier to generate more force while swimming, as opposed to wading,” he said.
As a close to the press conference, English had Smith demonstrate the “swimmability” of the West Auckland river where they held their press conference.
Smith shed his suit and stripped down to a pair of boardshorts, before diving into the river. He violently collided with the solid surface, and screamed in agony. Eventually, he was able to shuffle his way into the sludge, and slowly use his arms in a swimming motion to dig through the river to the other side, whereupon he gave a tired thumbs up.

People tend to think of New Zealand as a tiny little country tucked away in the corner of the globe, much smaller than continents like Australia, Europe, or Asia. But a groundbreaking new discovery suggests that couldn’t be further from the truth, with prominent geologists saying that the islands we know as New Zealand actually appear to be part of an enormous underwater land mass called Earth, or The Planet.
The case for this extraordinary claim was made in a paper recently published to GSA Today, the journal of the Geological Society of America.
“This is not a sudden discovery but a gradual realisation,” wrote the authors of the study. “As recently as 10 years ago, we would not have had the accumulated data or confidence in interpretation to write this paper.”
The paper’s chief author, Nick Mortimer, says the magnitude of the discovery cannot be underestimated.
“If I told you that New Zealand, actually, or what we know of as New Zealand, is only 0.05% of the land mass it actually sits on, what would you think?” he said. “You’d be blown away, right? You’d be utterly gobsmacked. But that may just be how it actually is.”
What we thought was the Pacific Ocean may just turn out to be “kind of a giant lake” in “this greater continent of New Zealand,” he added.
Prime Minister Bill English and Foreign Minister Murray McCully both said, when asked, that they were “looking into” the territorial implications of the discovery, and whether New Zealand was potentially entitled to “most of” the planet.
“I wouldn’t want to get ahead of the story too much,” said McCully, “but it certainly does look that way, doesn’t it?”
Asked exactly how much of the planet he thought he’d be able to claim if the paper turned out to be accurate, McCully replied “All of it.”
“Yeah, I mean, if it’s all connected,” he said.
This week’s discovery comes just a year on the heels of scientists rethinking whether the Earth’s oceans are all “one big ocean,” after satellite images revealed there are no actual lines between them.",NaN,21/02/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/takethataustraliafeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"‘Why the hell do I have the same three panelists?’ Rove erupts as he learns he isn’t hosting The Project permanently
","Rove’s agent has pleaded with the public to have some sympathy for him, as it’s just that he “hasn’t been on TV for a while.”
Chaos and anger have erupted at MediaWorks studios this evening as noted Australian Rove McManus has showed up to film the show’s second episode, apparently believing himself to have been the permanent host of the programme.
Rove was the first guest-host of Three’s latest attempt to smother current affairs to death last night, but in an apparent misunderstanding, turned up for filming again this afternoon.
“Why the fucking hell do I have the same three panelists?” Rove screeched as he arrived on set, tossing a cup of hot coffee on a nearby producer. “Whose idea was this!?”
When informed that Jesse Mulligan, Kanoa Lloyd and Josh Thomson were a permanent fixture of the show – and he was only temporary – things became more violent.
“These three!?” he scoffed. “You can’t have a different host every night. You’ll run out of good hosts willing to go on this shitshow in two weeks, and then it’ll just be Paul fucking Henry permanently, won’t it?”
McManus physically lashed out at several camera operators with a sharp bread stick from a nearby catering table, and lay in a foetal position on the floor to avoid being removed by security.
New Zealand-born model Kylie Bax was set to guest-host the programme tonight, but with less than half an hour to go until it airs, it’s still uncertain whether McManus will have left.
Sources say that MediaWorks may just concede to the Australian comedian, and extend the desk to include both him and Kylie Bax, something they say is consistent with their long-term plan to gradually move Jesse Mulligan further and further to the left of screen until he’s off it entirely.",NaN,21/02/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/roveprojectfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"The Civilian is rebranding!
","Every organisation goes through changes. Telecom became Spark. Woolworths became Countdown. John Key became Bill English. Vegemite became Marmite. And most recently, TV3 became +HTHEA@?
Today, The Civilian joins the long and prestigious list of companies that have undergone a much-needed makeover.
When we first launched, the world was a much less streamlined place, where you had to put in your pin number to buy things and phones had edges. But we’ve moved on since then, and we’ve done away with some of the more cumbersome parts of our daily lives.
Today, things are simpler, and less weighed down by convention and needless frills.
The name “The Civilian”, written underneath a man with a bowler hat and cane, is very March of 2013, and doesn’t reflect the modern environment we operate in.
So we’re doing away with the cumbersome and superfluous parts of our identity. We’re streamlining our image.
We’ll be doing away with the needless “Civilian” part of “The Civilian”, and will be known henceforth as simply “The.”
Also the logo is pink now for no reason.
The isn’t just a word. It’s the definite article, which is our new slogan.
It’s also a powerful three letter statement, which stands for Trustworthy, Holistic, and Epidermis.
You can even put in your own words, so long as they start with T, H, E, or have one of those letters anywhere in them, as demonstrated by the marketing campaign for +HTHEA@?’s new AM program.
We hope you’ll join us on this new and exciting journey, that you share our vision, and that you don’t notice that nothing has changed at all.",NaN,17/02/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/THE-2-300x140.png,Fake
"Dan Carter apology comes too late: thousands of kids already drink driving to emulate their hero
","There are chaotic and deadly scenes on New Zealand’s roads this afternoon as children of all ages take cues from their idol, Dan Carter.
All Black great Dan Carter has apologised on Facebook this afternoon for being caught driving drunk in Paris, but police say it’s too little too late, as children from Reinga to Bluff are engaging in what they’re calling an “outbreak” of drink driving.
“All across the country, it really is out of control,” said Police Commissioner Mike Bush, at a hastily arranged press conference this afternoon. “There are a lot of children in this country who look up to Dan Carter, who have posters of Dan Carter on their walls – boys and girls, actually – and they’ve really taken a strong message from this.”
320 arrests have been made already, with kids ranging from ages 19 down to just 3 years old getting behind the wheel while shitfaced drunk.
“You can’t blame them, really,” said Bush. “They’re just doing what they’ve seen their role models do on television.”
Even adults were copying Dan Carter, apparently no longer feeling any shame for their actions.
“Ah, I’m not that ashamed,” slurred one driver about to turn onto Auckland’s Southern Motorway this afternoon. “Fuckin’ Dan Carter’s done it, and he’s a fuckin’… what are we talking about?”
While most children are being let off with a warning, the situation has become so dire that Bush says police may have to start pressing charges of driving while blasted off your tits.
“That’s not a DUI,” he noted. “That’s a very serious charge.”
The issue has become so serious – with countless cars careening off the road and into fences, light poles, houses, and other obstacles – that even Labour Party leader Andrew Little has weighed in on the chaos, blaming the Government for not keeping a tight enough control on current and former All Blacks.
“What is going on, when in the space of less than six months, we have All Black having sex in a toilet, and then All Black goes and drives drunk?” he wrote in a statement this morning. “All I know is that this All Black is totally out of control and I’ve heard nothing from the Minister about it.”
Carter posted his apology early afternoon New Zealand Time – after the children’s drink driving epidemic had already begun – but it has made no discernable difference in the number of arrests.
Police believe the lack of improvement after Carter’s apology may have to do with the sentence where he wrote “Done this lots, never got caught, oh well, guess I’ll take back streets next time.”",NaN,17/02/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/carterdrunkfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"PM concedes tossing Gerry Brownlee down the hill to appease the fire was ‘probably a mistake’ but ‘he will be remembered’
","English also briefly addressed other elements of the response that may have been a mistake, including the initial decision to use gasoline instead of water.
In his first visit to the scene of the Port Hills fires today, Prime Minister Bill English has conceded that the initial decision to roll Gerry Brownlee down the Hoon Hay Valley in an attempt to appease the fire may have been a mistake, and perhaps based on faulty science.
The decision to toss Gerry into the flames was made last night by local fire services after they spent all night screaming into the fire “What do you want!?”
Using special listening equipment, some volunteers thought they heard it bellow back “Gerry Brownlee”, but it is now thought it was actually asking for Australian cricketer George Bailey.
Bailey was not available to be reached for comment or human sacrifice.
Brownlee was rolled down the hill at approximately 7:42am this morning, and reached terminal velocity shortly thereafter. Upon making contact with the flame, he carried it all the way down the hill, and spread it “much farther” than it is believed it would have gone otherwise.
“Yeah, look, I can’t comment on matters of that nature,” the Prime Minister told media today. “That’s for the relevant specialists to say, but it does appear, in hindsight at least, that may not have been the best move.”
English “accepted” that it was “a reasonably bizarre thing” to roll a Government Minister down a valley as a means of firefighting.
“That is not how I understand fires are normally fought, no,” he said. “But you’d have to speak to the relevant specialists, as I said.”
The Prime Minister said he “did not” sign off on the plan to roll Brownlee down the hill, but accepted, given the circumstances, he “might have.”
While he insists he’ll be remembered either way, English said he has no reason to believe Brownlee perished during the rolling procedure, and is probably “just trapped on his back somewhere.”
Yesterday, Brownlee had gone on record criticising fire services for their initial response to the crisis, saying that they had “repeatedly tried to push me down the hill.”",NaN,16/02/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rollinggerryfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Fears thousands of rubberneckers may be left with nowhere to go if fire is brought under control
","Generous Cantabrians came together last night to give food and warm clothes to vulnerable rubberneckers who had put themselves out in the cold.
As fire response crews begin to make positive steps in the containment of Christchurch’s Port Hills fire, fears are beginning to mount about the thousands of rubberneckers who may be left hopeless and with nowhere to go once the flames are finally under control.
Reports are emerging this afternoon that the fires are largely contained, but this may come as grave news for the city’s voyeurs, who have assembled in their hundreds and even thousands in nearby parks and hills over the past few days, in an attempt to get a good view of the chaos.
Many Christchurch rubberneckers were forced to go to back to work this morning, and now fear there won’t be a raging inferno for them to come back to.
“Where am I going to go?” sobbed David Chester, a 42-year-old man who had brought his kids out to the Port Hills two days in a row to watch the fires. “There’s so much less smoke today. I’m going to be left with nothing.”
“You can’t see shit today,” bawled another onlooker, Kirsty McMann. “No fireballs or anything. It feels like I’ve lost everything.”
McMann said she was not consoled by the fact that she and her family were at least safe.
Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel said an abundance of rubberneckers with nowhere to go was a “serious problem” and the Council is mapping out contingency plans to deal with it.
She said Civil Defence were urging any rubberneckers with nowhere to return to tonight to assemble in South Hagley Park, where the Council will be lighting its own fire for them to stare at.
Additionally, they’re encouraging generous residents to light their own controlled fires for rubberneckers to come and watch in their own back yards.
“The last thing we want is these poor, poor people going around lighting their own uncontrolled fires just to satisfy their twisted lust to watch the world literally burn,” she said.
But it may be too late. As of this evening, police are reporting upwards of 40 uncontrolled fires burning throughout the city, as well as several intentional floodings, and people blowing really hard in an attempt to create a hurricane.",NaN,16/02/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/rubberneckfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"Political stunt backfires: Gareth Morgan trapped in glass case for days after no one realises he’s missing
","Morgan says he doesn’t regret the stunt, but would perhaps make the glass a “tad less strong next time.”
In a Waitangi Day political stunt that didn’t go quite to plan, Gareth Morgan has been trapped inside a glass case for the whole week, after nobody realised he was missing or went to find him.
On Monday, Morgan intentionally enclosed himself in the case to promote his new Opportunities Party ahead of this year’s election.
Morgan’s idea was reportedly that, after a day or two, people would realise he hadn’t made any social media posts or turned up to work or the functions he was due to attend, and would go looking for him. They would eventually find him in a glass case surrounded by thousands of hundred dollar bills.
In front of the case would be a key emblazoned with the Opportunities Party logo and accompanied by a little note that read “Unlock Innovation.”
Using the key on the glass case would unlock it, freeing Morgan and a “new generation of innovation and economic opportunity.”
But the stunt went horribly wrong, as nobody realised Gareth was missing, and he remained trapped and lonely inside a glass casing that he had designed to only be opened from the outside.
By Wednesday, he had begun trying to free himself manually, repeatedly ramming his skull against the walls until he bled and eventually fell unconscious.
Early on Friday morning, Morgan was finally able to tip the case over, and limped his way to a local police station.
Police say Morgan entered the station at 10:43am this morning, bleeding from head to toe, and suffering thousands of tiny lacerations.
“He’s in a bad way,” said constable James Taffort. “The glass has obviously smashed around him and it’s just a very ugly scene. He’s done the right thing, though, I suppose, in getting himself out; we’re fairly confident no one would have found him and he would eventually have starved to death had he not broken free.
“He’s very lucky to be alive.

"Auckland father terrifies son by telling him of mythical place called ‘the provinces’
","Tales of the provinces are based on largely unreliable anecdotes from delusional Aucklanders who strayed too far down the southern motorway.
An Auckland father has sent his son off to bed tonight by telling him a story of a mythical place called “the provinces,” where people support rugby teams other than The Blues and poors can in some cases afford houses.
The man’s son was physically and emotionally rattled as his eyes were opened to a potential world outside Auckland, where people can’t even see the Sky Tower from their house.
“People don’t live there, though, do they, Dad?”
“Some say they do,” he replied. “Some say they do, and some say that they drive only fifteen minutes to work and in some places, they don’t even get international concerts every week.”
Tears began to well up in the boy’s eyes.
“In winter, in the provinces, it can get below 15 degrees Celsius,” he continued, “and sometimes the ground shakes and destroys everything. In the provinces, there are places where they don’t even have streets full of new age cafes and other total wank.”
The boy began to shake.
“Relax, son,” he said, smiling. “It’s probably not true. The provinces probably don’t exist, and you won’t have to think about them, ever.”
The boy asked his father whether the Coromandel – where they had just spent their Christmas holidays – could be part of the provinces.

"TV3 becomes ‘Three’ in final acknowledgement that it is no longer television
","MediaWorks says it has yet to decide whether Dai Henwood dancing is a permanent part of the logo, an indecision it says solidifies the channel as “dynamic” and “confused.”
TV3 has announced this evening that it has dropped the TV from its name in order to better reflect the fact that it is no longer television, and rather just another arbitrary numbered placeholder in the ever-expanding list of increasingly redundant free-to-air stations.
MediaWorks chief content officer Andrew Szusterman says the change is a “positive step forward” to “acceptance” that TV3 is “dead, really.”
“When you look at the TV3 brand as it stands, it’s been around since 2003,” he said. “That’s a long time, and really in that time, we’ve seen a lot of changes. The 2003 brand doesn’t really represent what the channel is in 2017, which isn’t so much TV, as it is just some kind of endless focus group and marketing exercise that never goes anywhere and just hands bigger ratings to our competitors.
“So we thought it made sense to drop the ‘TV’”
In addition to the name change, Three will get a new logo: a cryptic series of symbols and letters that reads “Plus HR equals E”, which Szusterman says is “kind of code language” for “Watch TV One.”
“We knew we wanted to get rid of the TV bit,” said Andy Brown, MediaWorks chief marketing and data officer. “That much was obvious. But of course when you get a new name, you have to have a new logo.
“So I took our team of designers, graphics people and all that, and I said to them ‘just fuck it up.’

"Bill English coming dangerously close to a heart attack every time he answers the phone
","English is said not to be introducing himself when answering the phone, timidly asking “Hello?” in an attempt to make sure of who it is.
There are growing concerns about the Prime Minister’s health today as staff report that his stress levels are reaching breaking point, and he appears visibly startled and frightened every time his phone rings.
Bill English has been expecting an important phone call sometime this week, but there is a lack of certainty about exactly when it will come.
Those in his orbit say his behaviour is “erratic” near the telephone, and as time passes, the problem is getting worse.
“Out and about, he’s fine,” said one staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and on the condition that the interview was totally platonic and would not include small talk about the weather. “When he’s in the office, near the phone, he’s a bit nervous, but all in all he calms down after a bit. The moment the phone rings, though, oh god.”
English, who otherwise struggles to wear his emotions on his sleeve, reportedly screamed loudly the last time his phone rang.
“What the hell happened?” asked Chief of Staff Wayne Eagleson, barging into the room.
“Oh, phone rang,” replied English.
On another occasion the Prime Minister abruptly tried to put his head through the 9th floor window when he heard a phone ringing that wasn’t even his.
Afterwards he acted like nothing had happened and like “he hadn’t almost just died.”

"Record crowd turns out to watch grass dry in ‘fantastic showing’ at Napier
","Grass-drying is a popular event where two cricket teams come together to sit inside while men in hats debate whether the grass they’re walking on is safe to walk on.
Event staff at Napier’s McLean Park are thrilled this evening after a record crowd turned out to watch a field of grass dry over a period of 5 and a half hours, before being told to leave.
Organisers of the event estimate it’s the largest New Zealand crowd ever to attend a grass-drying, and say that it shows the popularity of the pastime is strong.
“I’ve never seen this kind of a crowd for an event like this,” said groundsman Daryl Tremain. “All turned up with this incredible sense of anticipation, they’re buying beers and food and just settling in to watch grass dry, and see the great action of men walking out every 45 minutes or so to check if it’s still wet.”
It wasn’t just a relaxing day for those who took time off work to witness the spectacle; the crowd really got energised at times, cheering loudly as groundstaff used the tractor sponge to try and extract moisture from the outfield.
“I think that was definitely the biggest cheer,” said Tremain, “when the tractor came out. It was just incredible to see so many people so into their drying.”
The crowd was made up of people from far and wide – not just Hawke’s Bay locals – and even the national cricket teams of Australia and New Zealand showed up to watch the grass-drying.
“That was pretty special, seeing them there,” said one Red Badge security guard. “A real honour, actually, and they were the ones who seemed most invested in the show.”
Fans had a great day at the Park, and were eager to talk to media about their experiences.

"Opinion: They’re saying I shouldn’t have citizenship but I’ve been here for at least several days
","By Peter Thiel
This is ridiculous.
Ever since everyone found out that I have New Zealand citizenship, they’re acting like I don’t deserve it. They’re acting like I got it just because I was rich.
Let me tell you: I’ve been in New Zealand for a long time, for maybe even four days, at least. I’m not in New Zealand now, but believe me, I have been.
I got there on a Sunday, or one of those other days, and I was immediately taken. I knew I belonged here – I mean there, but if I was there, it would here.
I quickly fell in love with your culture, and your trees, and the other sorts of things you have, like, I want to say, koalas? The Maori culture with the tongues and stuff, it was hypnotizing. I knew then and there that I was to be a kiwis.
And look, you might think of me as foreign, as some rich guy buying up property and just getting citizenship as a legal loophole to construct my own holiday utopia, and maybe it does even look vaguely like that.
But I’m as kiwis as the rest of you. I’ve been a citizen for more than five years, and in that time I’ve spent countless minutes immersing myself in your beautiful country and enriching culture. In the several days I’ve spent there, I’ve learned so much about what it means to be a true blue pukeko, which I know full well is a bird you have.
I love rugby, and your national team, the All Black. I even own my own powhiri, which I know is a real crowd pleaser when put on the barbeque. I like root beets, and get unduly excited when a foreign celebrity mentions New Zealand.
I voted for John Key twice, and enjoy that cake with the green things on it. I even watch all your best television shows, like Shortland Road, and the one with washed-up comedians reading out scripted jokes behind a desk.
I hate Australia, because they once bowled underarm in the baseball tournament.
See? I love New Zealand, and if you give me a chance, you’ll love me too.

"EXCLUSIVE: Five things that might not have happened on Richie McCaw’s honeymoon but are certainly physically possible
","Over the weekend, New Zealand’s favourite ball-handler Richie McCaw celebrated his honeymoon with his now-wife Gemma McCaw, who conspicuously has the same last name.
The McCaws rudely didn’t allow media access to their private honeymoon, so we don’t actually know what happened, or just how sweaty Richie’s wonderful thighs became.
But in lieu of actual coverage, here are five things that certainly could have happened, in that the physical laws of the universe allow for them:
 
 1. Steve Hansen repeatedly interrupted the honeymoon with tearful, drunken phone calls about the lamentable state of his own marriage
Just when Richie finally thought he’d get a break from Steve Hansen’s all-consuming clinical depression, the current All Black coach totally spoiled the honeymoon by calling endlessly to congratulate McCaw on his “beautiful marriage”, a thinly-veiled comparison to his own.
“It’s just so wonderful that you have something like that,” he sobbed. “You’re very lucky. Fuck, I wish that I –”
It was at this point that Richie would interrupt Steve to tell him he was trying to have a candlelit meal with his new wife, but Hansen continued to sob down the phone for hours.
The McCaws insisted to their waitress that everything was fine with their meal, despite the sounds of loud crying and dry heaving.
 
 2. Wayne Barnes refereed the honeymoon, and retroactively disallowed the 2007 French World Cup try
Wow! What a turnaround!
English referee Wayne Barnes agreed to referee McCaw’s honeymoon, and during proceedings, rumour has it he retroactively overturned the 2007 French forward pass that won them the World Cup quarter-final.
In light of the decision, the World Rugby Organisation has agreed the All Blacks are now the winners of the 2007 World Cup, having beat England in the semi-final and South Africa in the final, as according to international rugby laws, the All Blacks can never lose fairly.
Super!
 
 3. Richie tamed a group of wild horses with his soothing voice and physical dominance, and birds of all species gathered to build an immaculate bed of straw for the newly-weds to make love upon.
It’s a standard part of any honeymoon, but Richie’s presence made this one extra special.
 
 4. Richie regaled Gemma with the great tale of the time he saw Tana Umaga’s penis.
She’s heard it many times before, but she never tires of listening to Richie tell this one; he always leaves one little detail to the imagination until next time, so it’s never quite the same, and she never knows exactly what to expect.
 
 5. During a lovedrunk frolic through Otago fields and pastures, Richie and Gemma stumbled upon a beautiful cave concealed by a gorgeous waterfall. Upon entering, McCaw discovered cave etchings depicting his ancestors, and the Great Rugby War of 1722.
After venturing even further into the cave, McCaw discovered the tomb of the great Richidous MacCawnigaunch, his great great great great great grandfather. The tomb called to him, and he opened it, whereupon he was bathed in a white light.
In an instant, McCaw ascended to the heavens, where he met an elderly but wise Jonah Lomu.
Lomu showed him – in vivid 3D with complimentary glasses – the horrors of the Great Rugby War, and told him of how his ancestors had interbred to ensure the purity of their rugby skills was passed down through generations.
“Am I dead?” asked McCaw, to which Lomu smiled, and told him “No, your time has not yet come.”
Lomu grasped McCaw’s wonderful thighs with both hands, and bestowed upon him great powers of lovemaking and animal husbandry.
Upon returning to Earth, he saw Gemma once again, and put both these skills to immediate use.",NaN,25/01/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mccawhoneymoonfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"At the current rate, MetService says it will ‘never rain again,’ and ‘we will all die’
","MetService says the forecast is based on “current trends”
New Zealand’s national meteorological service has extrapolated its data from the last 24 hours to determine that – at the current rate – it will never rain again, our nation’s farms will be devastated, and we will all die due to lack of water.
The news comes after a bomb low hit New Zealand over the weekend, bringing heavy winds and rain. But since it passed, rainfall has ceased, and according to recent observations, MetService reports that “this appears to be the way things are now.”
“This is obviously quite serious,” said MetService meteorologist Chester Lampkin, pointing to an enlarged picture of two men fisting one another.
“Actually, no, sorry, not that,” he said, changing the slide.
“This is obviously quite serious,” he reiterated, pointing to a large picture of the country covered in confusing letters and numbers. “What we have moving over New Zealand now is what we call a large no rain system, and it appears, at least for the moment, that it will never rain again.”
Lampkin said the implications of this were “obvious” and that the data was, unfortunately, “fairly conclusive.”
“At current rate, the average rainfall expected per day is 0,” he said. “The data we base this on contains a sample size of literally more than a thousand different minutes.”
Asked if New Zealanders should panic, Lampkin replied “Of course.”
The descent of the country into permanent drought was accompanied this evening by a gradual lowering of light levels that Lampkin says is heading in one direction, “and one direction only.”
“At the current rate, we’ll be plunged into darkness forever,” he said. “It’ll just get darker and darker until even our lights don’t work because it’s so dark.”
These warnings come just days after MetService reported that we would likely “all drown” after extrapolated data indicated it would just keep raining forever.
They were later forced to apologize for and withdraw that forecast, but maintained that “it certainly looked that way at the time.”",NaN,24/01/17,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/alldieofdroughtfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
"The Civilian’s 2016 – A Year in Rear-view
","Wow. What a year it’s been.
It’s the kind of year that, after it all, just makes you want to put your feet up, crack open a beer, and shoot yourself in the face.
Whether it was earthquakes galore, political outcomes not even that octopus that predicted the world cup could’ve seen coming, or just that weird feeling gnawing at your subconscious that you aren’t really awake anymore and instead in some kind of never-ending layered dream, it’s been a truly remarkable twelve months.
David Bowie died, which is of course impossible. Leicester City won the Premier League. Donald Trump won the Republican nomination. Britain left the European Union. The Cubs won the World Series. Ireland beat the All Blacks. Donald Trump won the presidency. John Key resigned. And Malcolm Turnbull stayed Prime Minister for a whole year. At least so far.
Indeed, with more than two weeks still remaining, all bets are off.
But instead of prognosticating, we thought we’d close out 2016 in the only way that seems fit: by taking one last, horrible look back at a year we’ll never forget, through the headlines that shaped it.
Trump victory in New Hampshire a painful reminder of state’s heroin epidemic
When Donald Trump won the New Hampshire Republican primary back in February – his first ever political victory – it was a truly painful reminder of the narcotic nightmare the state’s residents are living with on a day-to-day basis.
Trump’s victory came on the back of a loss in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where Senator Ted Cruz took a victory in large part due to the state’s heavy concentration of evangelical voters.
But the landscape proved to be less favourable to him in New Hampshire, where a staggering 11.4% of 18-25-year-olds are heroin users, a demographic that helped deliver the primary to Trump.
“Well I must say, you know, I do very well amongst heroin addicts,” Trump acknowledged on MSNBC’s Morning Joe programme. “Heroin addicts love me. I think I’m going to be great for the heroin addicts.”
Election analyst and statistician Nate Silver said it was “no surprise” Trump performed so well in a state with such a rampant illicit drug problem.
“In some ways, this kind of demographic is his wheelhouse, really,” he said. “You know, we went to New Hampshire, spent about a week there, got a sense of what it was like on the ground. You wouldn’t go to a Trump rally without seeing at least a few people loading up at the door.
“And Trump’s just being Trump, he’s throwing needles to the crowd, everybody’s loving it. So while his margin was a little surprising, maybe better than expected, these people were always going to deliver for him.”

Academy appeases everyone by awarding Oscar to Black Leonardo DiCaprio
The Oscars had a very tricky line to walk this year, after a controversy over the lack of black nominees collided head-on with the anger of Leonardo DiCaprio fans who desperately wanted their favourite actor to get just one Oscar.
But the academy handled it perfectly, awarding its Oscar for Best Actor to Black Leonardo DiCaprio.
Black DiCaprio won the Academy Award for his stellar performance in the critically acclaimed survival blockbuster The Black Revenant, the African-American version of The Revenant, which itself contained no black people.
No other African American actors were honoured with an award, but the Academy repeatedly insisted throughout the nomination season that there is “no racism at play,” and it’s simply that “black people are quite bad at making movies, and perhaps things generally.”
They also pointed to the fact that they selected Black Chris Rock, the African-American version of Chris Rock, to host this year’s ceremony.

Fans of Bill English’s Budget series worried he won’t be able to tie all plot threads together by the end
Following the widely unanticipated release of the 8th instalment in Finance Minister Bill English’s Budget series back in May, fans began to fear that the plot had become so convoluted that he wouldn’t be able to tie it all together by the series’ end, which was expected in either the 9th or 12th instalment.
“I struggle to believe he’s going to end it all in the 9th Budget,” said long-time fan of English’s numbers, Jarrod Bakker. “There’s just so much going on and it’s not even really close to making sense at this point.”
That sentiment was echoed by other fans, who felt the latest chapter in the hugely influential saga did not go nearly far enough to resolving the many conflicts and character arcs in New Zealand, the possibly fictional world in which the Budget series is based.
Despite these criticisms, Bill English’s publisher, Prime Minister John Key, said that the latest instalment was the “biggest and best yet,” in part due to some exciting new developments, like inflation.
“I think most New Zealanders would agree that there are certainly more numbers in this budget than in previous budgets,” he told media ahead of the book’s release. “Lots of columns, possibly more columns. If you like columns, and if you liked the last few Budgets, well, this is much the same.”
Following Key’s shock decision to resign later in the year, Bill English will not do any further work on the Budget series, which is expected to be finished by Steven Joyce, who has spoken to English “at length” about how he wants it to end.

Leave voters disenchanted as the begin to realise UK is still in same geographical location
One week on from the Brexit referendum, voters who opted to leave the European Union were beginning to feel a sense of disenchantment with their choice, as they started to realise that Great Britain was geographically no further away from Europe than it was prior to the vote.
“I just wanted to get away from France,” said one leave voter. “The other day I took a drive down to Cliffs of Dover, and it’s still fucking there.”
French residents spoken to were equally disappointed.
While many in mainland Britain reported a lack of increased distance from the EU, those living in Northern Ireland said otherwise.
Northern Irish residents living close to the dividing line between the UK and the Republic reported that their countrymen on the other side did indeed feel “further away than ever.”

Small cardboard box sells for $150,000 in Auckland
The Auckland and wider New Zealand housing crisis kicked into high gear this year after a small cardboard box in Grey Lynn sold for $150,000.
The box, which features one bedroom, one kitchen, a bathroom, and a modest living area – all of which are the same room – was won at auction by a foreign bidder, who planned to add the home to his investment portfolio, which already included multiple Auckland homes, including an even smaller box he purchased in Manukau for $57,000 earlier in the year.
Political reaction to the sale was swift, with Green Party co-leader James Shaw questioning why a box like that would sell for such a high price, when politicians like the Prime Minister and others “probably have plenty of boxes at home that people could live in.”
But Prime Minister John Key dismissed Shaw’s rhetoric as “opportunistic,” saying that the sale had “nothing to do” with housing, and was not indicative of a housing crisis, because “it’s not a house, it’s a box.”
“I think most New Zealanders would agree that houses aren’t boxes,” he told National Radio, “and this is a box, not a house, I think, you know, I mean, that’s fairly obvious, I would have thought.”
Key acknowledged the sale did indicate a “certain kind of spike” amongst “box prices.”
“Certainly I think that’s quite a high price for a box,” he said. “And look, if you want to say it’s a house, if it is a house, then that’s quite a cheap house, actually, so that’s another way to look at it.”

Christchurch man can’t wait to build snowman out of mostly dirt tomorrow
When snow was forecast for Christchurch back in early August, one local man simply couldn’t wait to get out there and build a snowman from what would have been largely dirt.
“I can’t fucking wait, holy shit,” said a beaming Josh Ramsay, a fully grown 38-year-old man. “Fuck yeah, snow. Woah.”
The last time it snowed in Christchurch was 2012, when Ramsay said he took his kids outside to scoop up very thin layers of what barely passed as snow to build “a great big brown thing, not sure what it was, but wow!”
“Wow!” added his wife, Francesca, who also likes snow.
Other Cantabrians spoken to were equally excited for the potential to argue with their friends about whose house got the most snow, before making snow angels so shallow that the mud would totally wreck their clothes permanently.
Those feeling the wintry cheer included Canterbury sheep farmer Hugh McInnes.
“It’s going to kill all my sheep,” he said.

Chiefs saga highlights need for children to be better role models for impressionable rugby players
When the Chiefs rugby team found itself embroiled in a scandal over its gross mistreatment of a female stripper, it served as an important reminder for our children to be better role models for our nation’s impressionable rugby players.
“Obviously, in the last 24 hours, some really serious allegations have surfaced about some conduct in respect to our players, and we are taking those allegations extremely seriously,” the team’s CEO, Andrew Flexman, told media.
“I just think this goes to show, and highlights that, when you’re dealing with players like ours, who are very impressionable, not experienced in real life, really not at all capable of thinking for themselves most of the time, they can sometimes be very adversely affected by the role models they look up to, such as high school children, and fuckwits generally.”
All Blacks coach and sufferer of chronic depression Steve Hansen weighed in on the situation, saying that what high school kids and fuckwits are seen to be doing can have “flow-on effects.”
“I’ve spent a lot of time with boys like these over the years, as you know,” he said, “and while I don’t have the facts on hand, what I can say is this: the boys really look up to people like high school kids from all-boys schools, and they look up to fuckwits, and so when fuckwits and schoolboys behave in a certain way, rugby players can get the idea that it’s acceptable behaviour, and I think we have to be very conscious of that.”
He called on fuckwits everywhere to be “more conscious” of their actions, and perhaps participate in advertising campaigns to let rugby players know it’s not okay.
“It’s something we do need to look at as a kind of social outreach.”

TVNZ acknowledges experiment to cryogenically freeze man from 1920s and put him on TV today has failed
When TVNZ let Rawdon Christie go from their breakfast show in August, it amounted to an admission that its nearly century-long experiment to cryogenically freeze him in the 1920s, subsequently thawing him for use on their network in the current decade, had categorically failed.
Christie, a British aristocrat who struggled to adapt to life in the modern world and cope with the emotional struggles that come with being decades younger than his own grandchildren, left the network altogether when Jack Tame and Hilary Barry took his place.
TVNZ Head of News John Gillespie said it was time to acknowledge that it “hasn’t worked out.”
“It was a novel idea,” he said, “and while I can’t speak to my forebears’ intentions, I’m sure they had very good reasons for thinking it was a good idea. But the truth is, Christie just hasn’t gelled, and if I have to explain to him what a computer is one more time I think I’ll just totally lose it, and nobody wants to see that.”

Opinion: I think it’s fairly obvious I meant to send those sexy sexts to myself
When Colin Craig was – in a sweet twist of irony – taken to court for defamation in September, many of his sexts to former press secretary Rachel MacGregor came under public scrutiny.
In an opinion piece, Craig wrote the following about the sexts:
My golly, it’s been a strange couple of weeks, hasn’t it?
Firstly, my wife asked me to make dinner. That was surprising, and not really how things are supposed to work.
“You’re unemployed, Colin,” she says. That’s funny. I’m not unemployed. I’m the leader of the Conservative Party.
“You’re not the leader, Colin,” said the board, in a letter to me asking me to stop saying that I’m the leader. That’s funny, too. Only the leader has the authority to remove the leader, and if I’m not the leader, then who is the leader? It’s not Christine.
Secondly, passers by have started abusing me on my morning waddle; more than usual.
“Fuck you, Colin, you dirty creep!” yelled one woman. That wasn’t very nice. She yelled it quite loudly, too, which is why I’ve been forced to issue her with a notice of legal action on the grounds of defamation.
“Magic Hands Colin!” another man taunted. Thank you. I do have magic hands.
Thirdly, I ended up on trial in court and all my sexy sexts have been released for the world to read.
Ordinarily, I wouldn’t mind. I’m quite proud of my steamy sexy sexts, which demonstrate a wide use of erotic vocabulary, including all the essential words, like “naked” and “slept.”
I might have even included the winking emoticon here and there, though I do remember at least one occasion on which I couldn’t find it, and had to use the angry emoticon instead.
What I do mind is that they’re saying I sent these erotic steamy sexy sexts to my press secretary. I did, but it was entirely by accident, and anyone who actually reads them (please do so in a private place) will see that they were clearly directed at me.

NCEA debacle perfect opportunity for smug adults to demonstrate superiority to children
Back in September, An NCEA exam that subjected Year 11 students to questions allegedly above their curriculum level provided a welcome opportunity for smug adults to use the internet to demonstrate how much better they can perform tasks than a 15-year-old child.
Grown men and women across the country were thrilled to read the news that a large number of stupid and incompetent children had failed basic maths problems that weren’t half as hard as baby boomers had done when they were just toddlers.
53-year-old part-time nurse and Justice of the Peace Carol Baldwin said she couldn’t wait to get home and tell her husband about how she’d got every question on the test correct.
“I can do maths better than kids who are in some cases 14,” she boasted.
Prolific and well-respected Stuff commenter Robo2828 also seized on the opportunity to tell the country he had recently sat and passed a maths paper from Cambridge, which is a place for smart people in England.

Steven Hansen assures public that All Blacks would ‘not normally’ have sex
When All Black Aaron Smith was caught having sex with a mystery woman in an airport disabled toilet, coach Steven Hansen reassured a panicked public that All Blacks do “not normally” have sex.
While news media only referred to the disturbance in the disabled toilet as a “rendezvous,” “tryst” or “incident,” some reports began to emerge that Smith may have been “having sex” or otherwise “fucking raw.”
Hansen moved quickly to respond to those reports.
“Certainly it does appear that Aaron might have – and I do say might have at this juncture – had sex in the – or one of the – disabled toilets at Christchurch International Airport last month, with a woman who was ostensibly not his girlfriend,” he read from a sheet of paper that appeared only to have a drawing of a sad face on it.
“This is news to me, and I suspect shocking news to most of the country, but I just want to reassure anyone who might be worried that this kind of thing happens on a regular basis.”
Hansen said that as far as he was aware, the All Blacks do “not normally” have sex, and there would be strict disciplinary meetings with anyone who was found to.
“As has been widely reported in New Zealand media, the All Blacks are not like you or me. They are morally pure beings, without carnal urges, many do not even have penises, which is why it’s particularly shocking to me that Aaron would have done this.”

Nation prepares to commemorate Labour Day by gathering at grave of the Labour Party
New Zealanders of all backgrounds gathered on Labour Day this year to remember the enduring legacy of the now-deceased Labour Party.
A dawn service took place early on Monday morning, which was attended by the Prime Minister, as well victims of the party’s demise, including Phil Goff, David Shearer, David Cunliffe and Andrew Little.
Thousands of ordinary New Zealanders attended the service, as well as a candlelight vigil held at the grave of the party the night before.
“I think it’s really important that I teach my 5-year-old son about the Labour Party,” said former party member John Adams. “He’s going to grow up in a world without a Labour Party, and if I don’t teach him about it, he may never know it existed, or what it did.”
Numbers at the weekend’s services were even higher than last year, which Prime Minister John Key said was “encouraging.”
“Oh, look, I think, at the end of the day, everybody just wants a day off, put your feet up, have a beer, that kind of thing,” he said. “But really, we have to remember this is a sombre occasion. A party has died, and it’s good to see a lot of kiwis coming out to remember that.”

Suspect leads police on harrowing 13-hour chase round Panmure roundabout
Police in Auckland really had their hands full on the 20th of October, when a driver led them on a 13-hour chase round the iconic Panmure roundabout.
Police began chasing the suspect, who several motorists had flagged as driving erratically, at around 8:50pm the night before. The chase concluded at just past 10am in the morning, just several metres from where it began.
In two vehicles, police pursued the man as he drove in a mostly legal clockwise fashion around the roundabout an estimated four and a half thousand times.
Constable Darryl McArthur, who was one of the drivers pursuing the man, said it was exhausting, but he was just glad the chase was over.
“Oh, yeah, it was a long night,” he told media. “I’m just glad nobody was hurt, and we managed to bring this guy into custody.”
McArthur expressed a feeling of “helplessness” with the chase, saying, at one point, they had no idea how they were going to catch or intercept the suspect’s vehicle.
“He just kept going round and round and round, we were waiting for him to indicate, or something, but he just kept on going, so we had to keep on going.”
The man was finally forced from his car and arrested when it ran out of petrol just next to the Lagoon Drive exit.

After Ireland victory, fears that rugby could become dynamic game where multiple teams can win
After Ireland’s historic victory against New Zealand at Soldier Field in Chicago, fears began to mount among All Blacks leadership and fans alike, that rugby could become a dynamic game where multiple outcomes are possible.
“There is that fear among the fans I talk to, in any case,” said prolific sport commentator Scotty Stevenson. “New Zealanders love their rugby, because we always win and there’s not really even any point watching. It’s a total waste of a Saturday night, really. It’d be sad if we lost that.”
“I know a lot of people who were pretty downtrodden about what happened,” he added. “It was a really interesting game, quite close at times, spirited, great rugby from Ireland, and in the end, the underdog won, which was an incredible thing to witness, history in the making. We’re really hoping that doesn’t happen again.
“The northern tour was supposed to be, you know, these four easy wins, and now there’s real worry there might be exciting games on the horizon that are actually worth watching.”
All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith said any talk of this was “premature,” and there’s “no immediate risk” of rugby becoming “dynamic” or “even interesting.”
“This is a one off event,” he said. “We have to look at this as a one-off event, and say ‘How do we prevent this happening again? How do we make the next three games extremely boring, 54-3 romps that will make other nations not even want to play this game?’ That’s the mindset we’re taking to Italy, and anything beyond that is unwarranted panic.”
Fortunately he was right. The All Blacks rebounded, and the game today is as painfully predictable as it was before.

Holy shit
On the 9th of November this year, holy shit.
As the United States presidential election drew to a close. holy fuck. After a year and a half of campaigning, primary elections, presidential debates and rallies, the closing hours of the campaign proved to be the most what the actual fuck is happening? In an unlikely turn of events, oh my fucking god.
Voters around the country turned out in record numbers to fucking hell.
While many states, including Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan proved to be close contests, good fucking god.
As the end result became clearer, Hillary Clinton phoned Donald Trump personally to concede the race, and tell him “Holy shit.”
Just half an hour later, Vice-President-elect Mike Pence took the stage at a New York victory party to introduce Donald Trump, telling the audience “Fucking hell. Holy fuck.”
The crowd at the Trump event was jubilant, repeatedly chanting “USA!” and “What the fuck?”
President-elect Donald Trump followed with a historic victory speech, seeking to unify the country by telling America that he would be “a President.”
“Holy fuck,” he began. “Jesus fucking Christ. What is even happening?”

Civil Defence evacuates whole of New Zealand after engineers discover structural issues with the country
Following a series of earthquakes just one month ago, Civil Defence ordered the evacuation of “the entire North, South, Stewart and Chatham islands,” after inspections by engineers and geologists who discovered “significant structural issues” with the country as a whole.
“To be very clear, we are calling for the immediate evacuation of areas in this zone,” said Civil Defence director Sarah Stuart-Black, pointing to a map of the zone, which encompassed the whole country. “If you are in this zone, we ask you to leave as soon as possible, and remain out of this area until further inspections can take place.”
Airports overflowed with residents of the affected area, who were attempting to fly overseas, but were being met with fully booked flights.
“I really don’t know what the fuck is going on,” said Air New Zealand check-in operator Janice Gray. “We can’t put all these people on planes.”
Asked if she could just kind of stack them, Gray replied “No.”

Government pushes urgent legislation to end 2016, have New Year’s right now
Following the events of this year, Parliament sat under urgency on the 14th of November, as the National Government attempted to pass legislation to end 2016 effective immediately, and have New Year’s Eve in just a few hours at midnight that night.
The “That’s Enough Bill 2016” would have shortened the calendar in use by New Zealand by 47 days, with a year spanning from January 1st to November 14th.
Prime Minister John Key, joined by Minister Responsible for the Earthquake Commission Gerry Brownlee, announced his government would be pushing the bill after visiting Kaikoura, following a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in the North Canterbury region.
“Look, I think most New Zealanders would agree that, uh, that’s quite enough,” he said. “That’s why tonight, we’ll be moving to pass a bill that should resolve any forthcoming issues.”
Key said the bill was a “preventative measure” and would “unfortunately not reverse” anything that has happened since January 1st. But with well over a month still remaining in the year, National had finally felt compelled to act.
Providing the bill became law, Key encouraged New Zealanders to “enjoy ringing in the New Year” and “perhaps get shitfaced.”
Unfortunately the bill did not make it through Parliament, and as a result, the year continued, and Key, too, was claimed by it.",NaN,16/12/16,NaN,NaN,http://www.thecivilian.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016yearinrearviewfeature-300x205.jpg,Fake
A Christmas Miracle: The 3 Ways Baby Jesus Immediately Asserted His Dominance After He Was Born To Prove He Was The Son Of God,"With all the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, it’s easy to forget why we celebrate Christmas in the first place. This time of year is a chance to reflect on that blessed day in Bethlehem many years ago, when Jesus was born in a manger and then immediately established his sovereignty through a series of alpha moves. Here are the three ways baby Jesus asserted his dominance after he was born to prove he was the Son of God.
1. When he demanded Joseph fetch him wine the second his head came out of Mary
If you grew up going to Christmas services at church, you’re undoubtedly familiar with this special moment from the Christmas story that took place just as Jesus was crowning, when he opened his eyes for the first time and then stared directly at Joseph before ordering him to go get him some wine.

As it’s written in the first chapter of Matthew: 
“And as the child first appeared from the womb, he turned his gaze upon Joseph and said in a man’s voice, ‘Just as you were cuckolded by my Father in Heaven, so shall I delight in your weakness. Go, coward, and bring to me your best wine so that I may drink deeply and rejoice in my own arrival, for I am the Messiah and you are a virgin.’ And at the child’s word, a chorus of ten-thousand trumpets sounded in Heaven as Joseph, like a beaten slave, retreated fearfully and fetched his finest wineskin, which the newborn Savior then did empty in one great gulp before emerging fully from his mother’s womb and tumbling into the manger that Joseph had until then been sitting upon as a chair, leaving Joseph to stand on his weary feet.”
Wow—what a truly beautiful scene, and one we should all keep in our hearts as we celebrate Christmas this year.

2. When he took off his swaddling clothes and rubbed the wise men’s myrrh all over his naked infant body, forcing everyone to watch 
As we give presents to our loved ones this Christmas, it’s good to reflect on the very first time Christmas presents were ever given, as detailed in this remarkable exchange between Jesus and the gift-bearing wise men in Luke 2:4-6:
“The Wise Men saw the young child with Mary his mother and presented unto him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh, and the child shook each of their hands with a powerful grip and then became naked in their presence. The child then poured the myrrh upon his nakedness and commanded the men to worship him as he lathered all his parts. And when one of the Wise Men momentarily looked away, Jesus snapped his finger and made him lame as a warning to the others to not avert their gaze. Then the child asked the Wise Men, ‘Does my body look competition-ready to you?’ and the Wise Men agreed that it did, far more so than Joseph’s body, which was a bad one. The Wise Men then left and traveled through the nations, heralding the arrival of the new top-dog king.”

3. When he body-slammed a camel onto his own manger to prove that he was physically strong, too
As often depicted in Nativity scenes, Jesus’s humbling of a camel is without a doubt one of the most memorable parts of the Christmas story. From Matthew 2:12-16:
“...Jesus saw the camel chewing of its cud and said, ‘This is worst horse I have ever seen. We cannot have this.’ He then raised the beast high over his head and walked around with it for some time before throwing it down with tremendous force upon the manger, which burst into a great terror of splinters that flew in all conceivable directions, wounding Joseph and Joseph only. And lo, the broken-bodied camel did moan and die as the newborn Messiah did push-ups atop it, showing to all of mankind that he was strong and worthy of praise. Joseph then approached the child, who was still in his nakedness, and tried to dress him with swaddling clothes. Jesus did not enjoy this, and he withered Joseph’s fingers until they were small so he could not fasten the swaddling clothes, and because of this, Joseph could never practice carpentry ever again. The child then departed from the stable, saying he had plans, and strutted away naked down the road to Jerusalem, whistling beautifully into the night.”

Donations Needed: Wikipedia Has Posted An Appeal Asking For One Night Of Physical Intimacy From Each User,"Every year, Wikipedia admirably provides hundreds of millions of people free access to its articles, but the website still largely depends on donors to stay afloat. Earlier today, the online encyclopedia service issued a heartfelt plea for support to help keep their operations running: Wikipedia just posted an appeal asking for one night of physical intimacy from each of their users.
As of today, visitors to Wikipedia are being greeted by this brief, earnest message that pops up at the top of the page:
“We hate to ask, but we need a favor. Wikipedia has always depended on support from our readers, but over 99 percent of visitors to the site have never made a contribution to our mission, which is why we’re reaching out to you today to request a single evening of physical intimacy from each of our users. If everyone who uses Wikipedia pledged just one passion-filled night of giving and receiving pleasure with us, we’d have enough toe-curling orgasms to keep us running for a lifetime—but for that to happen, we need the people to make real commitments to caressing and licking every part of us while we moan and shiver with ecstasy. We know not everyone who uses our site will be able to give us an erotic scented-oil back massage as the rest of the world seems to just melt away, but if you can, we hope you’ll consider doing so to keep Wikipedia sexually satisfied for years to come. Thank you.”

Since posting the appeal, Wikipedia has added a counter to their landing page to show how many nights of physical companionship readers have pledged so far, and the featured article now links to an entry on what one-night stands with Wikipedia are generally like. The “Did You Know” section of the main page has also been updated with new facts about intimacy with Wikipedia, including tidbits like “the sweat generated from just 2 percent of our users engaging in a night of lovemaking with Wikipedia would be enough to fill the reflecting pool of the Taj Mahal” and “the versatility of the human vertebral column allows Wikipedia users to be either the big spoon or the little spoon during their single evening of passion with us.” They’ve even swapped out their classic logo for a new design of the Wikipedia globe in a steamy shower getting lathered up by a nondescript humanoid figure labeled “YOU.”
It looks like Wikipedia is really pulling out all the stops in their latest appeal to their users. While it’s definitely an uphill battle to convince users to open their legs for something they already get for free, here’s hoping Wikipedia is able to get the physical intimacy they need to stave off loneliness and keep things going for another few years.",NaN,2018-12-20T15:40:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ttTYOkLN--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/er2c70152fgjei65hdxr.jpg",Fake

Fighting Fire With Fire: Mitch McConnell Is Attempting To Channel Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Populist Appeal By Preparing A Supper Of Boiled Dog Live On Instagram,"Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has cultivated much of her extraordinary grassroots success through her candor and authenticity on social media, and now it appears that her foes across the aisle have caught on and are starting to crib from her playbook: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) just tried to channel Ocasio-Cortez’s populist appeal by cooking a supper of boiled dog live on Instagram.
Hey, if it works for her, maybe it’ll work for the GOP.
Speaking live to his 7,087 Instagram followers from his upscale D.C. townhome last night, the 76-year-old McConnell walked viewers step-by-step through his great-grandmother’s famous boiled dog recipe in an attempt to make himself seem more relatable to everyday Americans, clearly taking cues from similar cooking videos made by Ocasio-Cortez in recent weeks. Dressed in cowboy chaps and a T-shirt that said “BIG FOOTBALL GAME,” McConnell described the dish as a “hearty, normal American meal that only costs $700 to make and can sustain a  blue-collar family like mine for numerous sustenance cycles.”

The Senate majority leader then led a sick, elderly basset hound into his kitchen, licked his lips with anticipation, and declared that no ritzy D.C. steakhouse dinner could ever live up to the delicious, dry taste of boiled hound haunch.
“The first thing you’re gonna want to do is get out your dog-smashing brick and hit the dog in the head with it until it’s mostly dead,” said a smiling McConnell before producing a large brick and vigorously bashing the basset hound’s skull for 10 minutes straight, at one point pausing to remind viewers to be sure to save any brain chunks that fly out to make a dessert of brain milk later. “After that, put the dog in a big pot with 30 cups of salt and some Tylenol—just like Granny McConnell used to do—and then set the pot on fire for about nine hours until the dog becomes pulp. You’ll know it’s ready for sure when the meat starts hissing. Now, this isn’t gonna be the fanciest food you’ve ever eaten, but it’s down-home, regular American cooking that’ll fill you up and keep you energized during a long day of sawing at the minimum-wage automobile factory.”
As he live-streamed the dog slowly rendering and gurgling in its own viscera on the stovetop over the ensuing nine hours, Senator McConnell continued engaging his viewers with everyman banter, talking candidly about how he enjoys participating in classic American pastimes such as using lots of hammers to fix his house, watching YouTube videos of spiders eating their young on his humble American laptop,  and shooting machine guns in elementary schools. When he seemed to eventually run out of things to talk about, McConnell opted to recite the Pledge Of Allegiance very slowly for several hours until the boiled dog finally finished cooking, at which point the GOP leader hastily consumed 20 pounds of the molten, tarry dog hash in an unblinking frenzy while the “American Rock ’N’ Roll” preset on a Casio keyboard blared in the background.

After completing his meal, McConnell announced to his viewers that he needed to go do some repairs on his all-American monster truck, after which he stood up, recited the Pledge Of Allegiance one more time, and then stared frightened into the camera for several minutes until his security detail entered the frame and escorted him away.
Wow! 
While Rep-elect Ocasio-Cortez’s Instagram prowess might’ve given her the upper hand during the midterms, she shouldn’t rest on her laurels quite yet, because Mitch McConnell just proved that Republicans can be just as effective at using social media to win over the American people. But whether it’s a liberal or a conservative, in any case, it’s always refreshing to be reminded that, at the end of the day, politicians are just ordinary people who go home and make dinner like the rest of us.

Hot Hot Hollywood: Will Smith Has Been Singing ‘Hava Nagila’ Faster And Faster For 52 Hours Straight While Building A Mausoleum For All His Family And Friends,"When you’re out on the streets of Hollywood, you simply never know when your day is about to switch from “big freeway traffic” to “silver screen magic”—and today is no exception. Get ready to shout, “Lights! Camera! Action! Camera!” because one of La La Land’s best and brightest is shining out in Tinseltown today, and we have the scoop: Will Smith has been spotted singing “Hava Nagila” faster and faster for 52 hours straight while building a mausoleum for all his family and friends.
Like a movie scene right out of the Los Angeles Times, your favorite Men In Black hero is busy constructing a grand burial chamber for everyone he loves under the beautiful California sun, and a song of Jewish celebration is spraying out of his lips!

It almost seems too good to be true, but here is Will Smith himself at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and the Hollywood Sign, singing “Hava Nagila” extremely fast while simultaneously using logs and bricks and computer parts to build a mausoleum full of jacuzzi-shaped coffins for glamorous loved ones such as his wife and children, his best friend Tommy Lee Jones, and a man he saw at the bank this morning. When he first started singing, he was groaning the words very slowly, but now he is singing so fast that there is no time for him to breathe, and he is purple and bursting with veins due to the power of song!
The Grammys are buzzing, and the name they are screaming is “Will Smith is digging a grave for everybody he likes!”
As the old Jewish saying goes, when it rains it pours, and today, Hollywood is drowning in the hurricane of sweat and star power that is squirting from the pores of hard-working celebrity Will Smith: The French Prince Of Buenos Aires!

Just like you always dreamed, Will Smith is as loud as he is famous, and he is out on the street building a crypt and rocking a full construction worker’s costume that he bought at a Halloween pop-up store. As he bellows the Hebrew words Hava neranena at a blistering and ever-increasing velocity, he uses his .glamorous hands to dig holes for the corpses of his pals and close relations, and each hole is shaped perfectly so that a body will only fit inside if it is doing the splits (the most glitzy of celebrity leg positions!). For Will Smith, Hebrew is the language of love and also death, and of digging and construction.
Magnificent as it seems, it is simply not impossible! It’s another average day in Hollywood, where the stars come out even in the morning. If you’re in the area, be sure to swing by with your phone camera and grab a snap of Will Smith’s beautiful mausoleum before he finishes it and seals himself in the earth with his friends and family for all eternity, or else you’ve missed out forever.",NaN,2018-12-14T13:58:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--3mqAm3yq--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/df1rf4ojnuhdmvogqax8.jpg",Fake
"Incredible Savings: Costco Has Started Selling A Jumbo, Family-Sized Condom That Several Men Can Wear Together","If the remarkably cheap booze and rotisserie chickens weren’t already enough of a reason to pony up for a Costco membership, the wholesale retailer just released a brand-new, budget-friendly product that could potentially save you a whole lot of money in the long-term: Costco has started selling jumbo, family-sized condoms that several men can wear at once.

Sold as the Kirkland Signature Multi-Man Condom, the Costco-exclusive prophylactic comes equipped with an extra-wide lubricated ring that’s wide enough to accommodate not only you, but also all the men in your entire family. While traditional single-penis condoms cost upwards of $2 a piece, the Kirkland Signature Multi-Man Condom costs only $4.79 and can fit up to seven average-sized penises if they’re tightly wadded together, meaning you could potentially save up to $10 every time you, your dad, and brothers simultaneously have intercourse.

Here Are A Few Quick Tips On What To Do If You Accidentally Make Eye Contact With The Super Old Guy,"Even if you don’t know The Super Old Guy, you’ve definitely seen him. He’s the grinning 103-year-old who’s always rolling around very slowly on roller skates, looking for unsuspecting strangers to lure into incredibly boring and long-winded conversations. Make eye contact with him, and he’ll take it as an open invitation to start talking to you, and once he gets going he’s nearly impossible to shake. Don’t get suckered. Here are some tips for what to do if you accidentally make eye contact with The Super Old Guy.
1. Immediately shout, “I’m looking at your neck, not your eyes!”: Whether he’s hiding in the backseat of your car, impersonating a mailman to get you to open your front door, or parasailing by your plane’s window when you’re traveling, The Super Old Guy is a master at catching people off guard, and you should always have an easy escape plan ready to deploy in the event of an unexpected encounter. Perhaps the easiest way to scare him off if he makes eye contact with you is to simply shout “I’m looking at your neck, not your eyes,” as The Super Old Guy is incredibly self-conscious about his wrinkly neck skin and will quickly scurry away to stop you from looking at it. It’s crucial that you shout this the second he makes eye contact with you, because once he’s locked in with his weird-ass gaze, it doesn’t take long before your limbs start twitching, your teeth start chattering, and you lose all control over your faculties, leaving you totally powerless as he traps you in a never-ending cycle of one-sided banter.

2. Do not call the police: If you think calling the police will save you from an eternal conversation with The Super Old Guy, think again, because the police have long given up on trying to rein him in. After all, merely talking to someone isn’t a crime, and if The Super Old Guy isn’t doing anything illegal, then the cops sure as hell aren’t going to risk getting sucked into a conversation with him, too. They know damn well how much The Super Old Guy sucks, and even if he were to commit a crime, they’d likely just ignore the 911 call so they wouldn’t have to deal with him.
3. Strike up a conversation about your sex lives while maintaining eye contact the entire time: This may seem counterintuitive, but sometimes it’s best to face your fears head-on. What’s the worst possible thing that can happen after making eye contact with The Super Old Guy? If you answered, “I become trapped inside of him forever, never dying but also never truly living,” you are correct. Not much you can do about that one. But the second worst thing is that The Super Old Guy tells you about his sex life. So look that fear dead in the eye and attack it with everything you’ve got. Ask him what it’s like to have sex when you’re super old. Describe your favorite positions to him. Show him some pornography on your phone. Once you’ve transcended your fear, you’ll find that the decrepit man’s eye contact no longer holds any power over you.
4. Trick him into making eye contact with The Super Old Child so the curse is lifted: Obviously, this requires The Super Old Child to be in the same general vicinity, so it’s not going to work in every situation. But if the stars happen to align and you can get both The Super Old Guy and The Super Old Child in close proximity to each other, you should do everything in your power to get them to make eye contact. Just be prepared to run once it happens.

5. Just let him have your dog: Picture this: You’re out walking your dog and minding your own business when suddenly you see The Super Old Guy just standing there on the sidewalk doing a puzzle that’s somehow floating in mid-air. The Super Old Guy makes eye contact with you and says, “Beautiful animal you’ve got there, friend—mind if I give him a belly touch?” Not a situation anyone wants to find themselves in, for sure, but it happens more than you’d think. Luckily, there’s an easy way to handle such an encounter: The Super Old Guy likes touching dogs just as much as he likes talking to humans, so if you just let your dog run over to him, that’ll create enough of a distraction for you to make your escape. Sure, you’ll lose your dog, and your dog will likely die from neglect in The Super Old Guy’s care, but unfortunately that’s still a better outcome than getting stuck in a conversation with the dude.
6. Kick him in his fucking old-ass neck: In most cases, violence should be considered a last resort, but when it comes to unintentionally making eye contact with The Super Old Guy, it’s a perfectly reasonable course of action. He’s old, his neck is old, he’s looking you right in the eye, he’s slowly extending his hand toward you, and he will ruin your life if you don’t do something to stop him, so you might as well just halt him dead in his tracks with a swift kick right to the ol’ neck.
7. Toss a blanket over his head: Maybe it won’t do anything, but it can’t hurt to try.

8. Hand him a photo of himself and walk away: Just take our word on this one. Always keep a picture of The Super Old Guy handy, and if he ever makes eye contact with you, slap the photo in the palm of his hand, turn around, and walk away. You’ll hear him screaming in agony for you to take the photo away, and you’ll smell burning flesh, and it will be scary, but it’s crucial that you don’t turn back around and try to help him. Just let it happen.

"Honoring A Legend: After Sitting Courtside At Lakers Games For Over Four Decades, Jack Nicholson Is Now Allowed To Shower With The Team","As a season ticket-holder for over four decades, Jack Nicholson has become an iconic fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, passionately cheering on the team from his courtside seats at nearly every home game, and it looks like the team is finally returning the favor: The L.A. Lakers have announced that Jack Nicholson is now allowed to shower with the team!
Wow. What a wonderful way to honor a legendary figure in Lakers history!
After the final buzzer of this Monday’s home game at the Staples Center, Lakers general manager Magic Johnson called Nicholson off the sidelines and onto the court in front of thousands of cheering fans. With the entire team standing by, Johnson announced that, as a sign of gratitude for his tireless support of the team, Jack Nicholson was forever welcome to strip down in the locker room and wash himself off alongside the Lakers players.

“Jack, your love of the Lakers and your dedication to this team has always been a source of inspiration for us, and nobody deserves to shower with these players more than you,” Johnson said as he presented an overjoyed Nicholson with an honorary key to the shower and a Lakers towel as the entire crowd cheered.
An emotional Nicholson had to fight back tears as he thanked the Lakers and the entire city of Los Angeles for the incredible honor and immediately began stripping off his clothing as he walked toward the Lakers’ locker room to take his first post-game shower.
Absolutely beautiful. It’s amazing to see the Lakers willing to go above and beyond to show their gratitude to their most dedicated supporter. Hopefully, Jack Nicholson enjoys the privilege of getting to clean himself alongside Lakers greats like Lonzo Ball and LeBron James. Other NBA take note: This is how you treat your fans!

"Holy Shit: Kyle Is Just Straight-Up Watching The Saddam Hussein Hanging Video On A Library Computer, Right Where Teachers Can See Him And Everything","If you’re a student at Kendall Middle School, you may want to beeline straight for the library, because word is some truly wild shit is going down: Kyle is currently just straight-up watching the Saddam Hussein hanging on a library computer, right where teachers can see him and everything.
Whoa. Leave it to Kyle to take things to a fucking 11 right in the middle of a school day.
Advertisement

According to kids on the scene, Kyle was just moments ago trying to explain the gnarly 2006 Saddam Hussein execution video to a group of friends when he decided descriptions simply couldn’t do it justice, at which point he elected to throw any semblance of caution to the wind and just pull the grainy video up right there on a library computer, making absolutely zero effort to hide his actions. Witnesses say that Kyle currently has the disturbing video opened full-screen and full-volume on one of the reference computers in the middle of the library—even though a couple of the more secluded study computers on the back wall are totally available—meaning the fucked-up footage of Saddam’s lifeless corpse swinging around from a noose is just playing right there in full view of the old-ass librarian and any other faculty who happen to be walking past.
It’s seriously fucking nuts.
Between taking a high-altitude dump while perched atop a bathroom stall and faking a seizure to get out of a Spanish test, it’s already been a pretty ballsy year for Kyle, but with this latest stunt he’s basically begging for an in-school suspension. According to sources in the library, he’s now got some weird-ass Russian website opened up and he’s looking for an ISIS beheading video which he claims makes Saddam’s hanging look like “fucking Disney shit.” And if his brazen disregard for library media rules weren’t already crazy enough, apparently he’s also got a huge half-finished bottle of blue Powerade sitting open without a lid right next to the computer, seemingly unfazed by the fact that getting caught with food or drink in the library is an automatic detention.

The dude’s out of control.
However, when Kyle does inevitably get caught he probably won’t even care, as rumor is he’s pretty much being raised by his older brothers and they don’t give a shit about him getting in trouble. Simply put, the guy plays by his own rules, and as long as he’s not hurting anyone we are 100 percent on board with whatever batshit antics he wants to pull. So keep it up, Kyle!

"Streamlined Ceremony: To Save
Time The Oscars Are Ditching The Award Show And Instead Will Just Post An Excel
Spreadsheet Listing All The Winners","It’s no secret that the Academy had trouble finding a host for this year’s Oscars, but fortunately that won’t be a problem anymore. To streamline the infamously long ceremony, the Oscars will ditch the awards show entirely and instead post a simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheet listing all the winners. 
Smart idea! Instead of having a host present an expensive four-hour ceremony, now everyone can quickly glance at a doc to find out who is taking home Hollywood’s highest honor.

“This is the 21st century, and computers exist now,” explained the Academy in a press release announcing the improved Oscars. “There’s no reason to force millions of people to turn on a TV and watch boring celebrities banter with each other for ages just to get a very small amount of information that can easily be displayed in a few Excel columns and rows. On February 24, just log on to Oscars.org and press the “download” button to open the .xls file on your computer and see which actors and filmmakers will be receiving an Oscar in the mail.” 
Awesome! Now watching the Oscars will only take you a few convenient seconds. Best of all, the Oscars spreadsheet entirely eliminates the need to find a host!
Although most of the usual Oscars ceremony will be skipped, the In Memoriam segment is sticking around as a second worksheet page, and you can view everyone that died by clicking the tab on the bottom of your screen. That’s much quicker than playing movie clips accompanied by sad music!

6 Of The Biggest Differences Between The British Version Of ‘The Office’ And The Zapruder Film,"The Office is a British cult classic comedy that has been remade in many countries with each one differing in subtle ways. Here are the six biggest differences between the British version of The Office and the American-made Zapruder film.
1. Sense of humor: The original British Office relies much more on that classic, dry, British sense of humor, while the Zapruder film chooses to instead focus on the shocking assassination of an American president.
Advertisement

2. Plot lines: Sharp-eyed viewers will notice the key differences in many of the storylines these two shows contain. For example, in one plot line of the Zapruder film, the president of the United States is shot in the head, but in the British version of The Office, every character’s head pretty much stays intact throughout the entire series.
3. David Brent vs. JFK: Ricky Gervais’ dimwitted character David Brent is depicted as being very unlikeable in the British version. In the Zapruder film, John F. Kennedy is a the lovable president who gets cheered on by thousands of onlookers before getting assassinated in a convertible.
4. Setting: The original BBC show takes place in the dreary town of Slough, Berkshire in England, while the Zapruder film takes place in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, TX on a sunny November morning that would change America forever.

"Sorry To Hear That, Dave: Dave Matthews Has

Man, that’s rough. Sorry to hear that, Dave.
Earlier this morning, the Dave Matthews Band frontman broke the sad news to fans through a series of tweets in which he detailed how that big solar eclipse from a bit ago left him permanently without sight:

"Father Of The Year: His
Daughter Loves Frozen, So For Her Birthday This Awesome Dad Cursed The
Land With Eternal Winter","There are great dads, and then there are dads like Tom Herbert who recently went above and beyond to give his kid an amazing birthday surprise. His daughter Hailey is a huge fan of Disney’s Frozen, so, for her eighth birthday, he made her party extra special by cursing the land with eternal winter just like Elsa does in the movie.
Way to go, Tom! Unleashing a deathly chill that smothers the world with ice and snow is pretty much the best B-day gift a Frozen fan could ask for!

Tom revealed the incredible treat as Hailey and her friends were eating birthday cake in their backyard. He turned on a stereo to play “Let It Go,” then gestured at the blue sky and used his icy powers to summon a raging snowstorm that blotted out the sun with gray clouds. As flurries of snowflakes swirled around him, this one-of-a-kind dad then fired glowing blue frost blasts from his fingertips to encrust every tree with icicles and freeze lakes and rivers solid in a never-ending winter with no spring. 
Yup, Tom is definitely our nominee for father of the year. Hailey must have been especially thrilled when all her friends were transformed to solid ice, the same as the curse afflicting Princess Anna! 
Some fathers might refuse to act like a Disney princess, thinking it isn’t manly to unleash infinite winter across the land, but by blighting the countryside with endless cold, Tom is proving that there’s nothing more awesome than being a good dad.

Hailey is one lucky kid to have a father willing to forever freeze the world for her birthday.

Amazing Discovery: Researchers Have Found That Middle Aged Women Who Believe Home Is Where The Heart Is Are 10 Times More Likely To Live Laugh Love,"A groundbreaking new study just uncovered some compelling evidence about how perceiving the world a certain way can dramatically improve one’s quality of life: Researchers have found that middle-aged women who believe that home is where the heart is are 10 times more likely to live, laugh, love.
Amazing!
Following an exhaustive five-year study, researchers at Stanford University have found conclusive evidence that believing home is where the heart is not only dramatically increases one’s probability of live, laugh, love, but it also signals an exponentially greater disposition towards singing like no one’s listening and dancing like no one’s watching. Researchers discovered the correlation by analyzing the high-frequency brain activity in hundreds of women ages 40 to 60, using cutting-edge medical imaging technology to detect which cerebral regions were lighting up in response to wall-plaques sentimentalizing the family home.

“While scientists have long known that women who believe home is where the heart is are neurally inclined toward daring to dream and being too blessed to be stressed, we were shocked to learn that such women also possess extraordinary abilities to live, laugh, love,” said lead researcher Dr. Samuel Horine. “Most of these women were just ordinary suburban mothers, and yet their aptitude to live, love, laugh far exceeded that of the average population, especially if they also believed that it was important to sing like no one is listening, dance like nobody is watching, and love like you’ve never been hurt.”
Dr. Horine also stated that the team initially surmised that the off-the-charts correlation between the two traits might be a result of environmental influence, noting that the women with the most frequent occurrences of live, laugh, love were also generally far more likely to have lifestyles dictated by shopping at Target, listening to Michael Bublé Christmas albums, and wearing LuLaRoe leggings. Surprisingly, however, many of the women’s capacities to live laugh love remained unaffected even when they were cognitively impaired due to it being wine o’clock, suggesting that the quality is biologically innate rather than a result of external environmental stimuli.
Truly fascinating!
For middle-aged women who believe that home is where the heart is, this has seriously got to be the biggest scientific breakthrough since the discovery that it takes more muscles to frown than to smile. And the fact that the team’s incredible findings defied their initial hypothesis just goes to prove the old maxim popular among women who live, laugh, love that you should always shoot for the moon, because even if you miss you’ll land among the stars.

"6 Big Roles Tony Danza Turned Down Because The
Character Wasn’t Also Named Tony ","Some of the most iconic roles in film and television history have been offered to Tony Danza, but he’s passed on many of them simply because he’d rather the character not have a different name than his own. Here are six big roles Tony Danza turned down because the character wasn’t also named Tony.
1. Michael Scott
When NBC offered Tony Danza the lead role for the American remake of The Office, he immediately said that they must have made a mistake in assigning him a character that wasn’t named Tony. “My name’s Tony, so I’ve got no business playing a Michael,” said Tony to the producers, explaining that they must have confused him with someone named Michael. When they confirmed that they were indeed offering the part to him, Tony declined, saying that they really needed to hire a Michael for the role, going so far as to suggest his friends Michael C. Hall, Michael Fassbender, and Michael Bloomberg to play the part instead.

2. Forrest Gump
Tony Danza could have been the star of this 1994 classic, but he declined the role when he learned that his character would be named Forrest Gump. When he asked if the character could be “Tony Gump” instead, Paramount producers argued against it, saying that they’d have to change the movie’s title to “Tony Gump” as well. Tony then reassured them that the movie title could still be Forrest Gump, arguing, “I played the main guy named Tony on Who’s The Boss? and we didn’t need to call the show Who’s The Tony?” But despite his protestations, producers were unwilling to change the name. 
3. Hagrid
The opportunity to play a major part in one of the highest-grossing film franchises of all time was not enough of an incentive for Tony to compromise on his values, as he famously rejected the role of Hagrid in Harry Potter And The Sorcerer’s Stone. When director Chris Columbus offered him the part, Tony immediately asked, “Is Hagrid’s nickname Tony?” When Columbus said no, Tony was quick to offer a solution, saying, “We could add a flashback scene right up top where we see people calling Hagrid ‘Tony’ when he’s a child, so then it’ll be really clear that Tony’s always been his nickname.” However, Columbus again refused, forcing Tony to angrily pass on the role.

4. Willy Loman
Dropping out of Death Of A Salesman’s 2012 Broadway revival wasn’t an easy decision for Danza, but when producers said it’d be an insult to playwright Arthur Miller to change “Willy Loman” to “Tony Loman” and argued against his claim that the name Tony would make the play newly relevant to a modern audience, he felt like he didn’t have another choice. 
5. Leatherface
Tony Danza was really gunning for a part in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so when producers offered him the role of Leatherface, he wasn’t going to accept that the character wasn’t named Tony without a fight. When Tony showed up to set on the first day of filming, he gave each person in the cast and crew a copy of a homemade script where he’d crossed out every appearance of “Leatherface” and wrote “Tony” in its place. The director was furious with Tony, but Tony insisted that the movie was way scarier this way. Reluctantly, the director agreed to let Tony rehearse one scene of his rewrite, but after he held up a chainsaw and screamed, “Tony’s going to murder you!” the director called cut and said that Leatherface’s name had to be Leatherface, at which point Tony announced he’d be unable to play the part and walked off the set.

6. Buzz Lightyear
Pixar thought Tony Danza would be the perfect actor to bring Buzz Lightyear to life, but Tony refused to voice the Toy Story character unless it was named Tony. When Pixar argued that Buzz Lightyear needed to keep his name to best convey to kids that he’s a superhero from space, Tony trotted out a group of children wearing tin foil space suits chanting “Tony the astronaut! Tony the astronaut!” While Tony thought he had provided all the proof he needed to convince Pixar that the character should be named Tony instead, they refused, once again forcing Tony to decline a major role.",NaN,2018-12-10T12:06:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--pbFIjN1h--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/curdzxx4lq7kqoupcv1w.jpg",Fake
Amazing! A Shaken Christian Bale Has Revealed The Only Preparation He Did To Play Dick Cheney Was Eating A Caesar Salad That Immediately Made Him Bald And Fat,"When it comes to actors who throw themselves into their roles, few performers in Hollywood are as dedicated as Christian Bale. The method actor’s physical transformation for Adam McKay’s Vice is among the most impressive of his career, and the way he did it will blow your mind: A shaken Christian Bale just revealed that the only preparation he did to play Dick Cheney was eating a Caesar salad that immediately made him bald and fat. 
Simply amazing. This is method acting at its absolute peak! 
At a press junket to promote the upcoming Dick Cheney biopic, a trembling, teary-eyed Christian Bale was nearly at a loss for words explaining how all he’d done to get ready for the role was eat a Caesar salad that somehow caused him to instantly gain 40 pounds and lose almost all his hair on the spot. Bale, notorious for the intensive exercise and eating regimens he embraced for films like The Machinist and American Hustle, fumbled with his microphone and hyperventilated as he told reporters he had made the Caesar salad himself at home, eaten it, and quickly realized something happened when his children began screaming  “Daddy’s gone large!” as the buttons on his dress shirt burst off onto the floor along with most of the hair on his scalp, his ballooning stomach emitting the sound of an ascending slide whistle note with every inch it swelled outward.

Despite having several months to capture Cheney’s physicality before shooting, it only took a seasoned pro like Bale one light lunch to get into character and pretty much guarantee himself an Oscar nomination. Whatever that Caesar salad did to Christian has paid off, because it has left the former Batman actor looking confused, slightly traumatized, and virtually unrecognizable. He has totally disappeared into this role! 
Wow. Christian Bale’s next-level acting techniques have our jaws on the floor yet again. Whether you’re a fan of his performances or not, you’ve just got to respect his devotion to his work.

Living The High Life: This Man Has A 680 Credit Score And No Serious Skin Conditions!,"At a time when more people than ever are unhappy and pretty much everyone seems to be struggling to stay afloat, here’s a rare story of someone who is truly living the dream: This man has a 680 credit score and no serious skin conditions.
Wow! What a life!
Though Brendan Garlock may be only 27 years old, he’s already enjoying a lifestyle fit for a king, boasting an above-average credit score that probably won’t hold him back from anything in life and good enough skin to where it doesn’t really cause him any problems. Never having to worry about things like psoriasis flare-ups or expensive dermatologist visits, Brendan has plenty of time and energy to practice fiscal responsibility. It sounds too good to be true, but somehow he’s making it happen. Not only does Brendan usually pay both of his credit cards on time, but also, if he were to ever try to buy a house, he’d probably get approved for a mortgage with a decent interest rate!

Sigh. Some people just have it all.
The sad reality is that we can’t all live the high-rolling life that Brendan does, but at least we can be happy knowing that when his pretty-much-zit-free head hits the pillow every night, he’s smiling from ear to ear. And you can guarantee he’s whistling a happy tune when he sees his credit score sitting solidly in the greenish-yellow portion of the graphic on his bank’s website—the guy’s literally only two or three notches away from being fully green! Brendan seriously must have been a saint or something in a past life to deserve such a sweet situation, because it really doesn’t get much better than what he’s got going on now.

Environmental Crisis: This Photo Of A Baboon Eating The Bugs Out Of Regis Philbin’s Hair On A Tiny Chunk Of Melting Ice Shows The Utter Devastation Of Climate Change,"Global warming is changing our planet in horrifying and potentially irreversible ways, and a nature photographer just captured its terrible impact in one incredible, heartbreaking image: This photo of a baboon eating the bugs out of Regis Philbin’s hair on a tiny chunk of melting ice shows the utter devastation of climate change.
Just awful. A picture like this says so much more than charts or graphs ever could.

When Norwegian photographer Sven Andersen spotted a baboon meticulously grooming beloved television personality Regis Philbin on a piece of sea ice no bigger than a twin bed, he knew he was about to take one of the defining photos of anthropogenic climate change. Where, decades ago, the baboon and Regis Philbin would have frolicked over vast, towering glaciers, now they must huddle on a tiny fragment of ice barely large enough to accommodate their bodies, helplessly watching as forces beyond their control carelessly erode what little habitat they have left. Looking at the baboon’s eyes as he carefully picks bugs out of the former Who Wants To Be A Millionaire host’s scalp, one almost senses a glimmer of deep sadness, as if he somehow knows that rising greenhouse gas levels all but guarantee that he and his friend Regis Philbin will not survive more than a few years.
Our cars, our air conditioners, our lifestyles of convenience and comfort—were they really worth it if this is the cost?
If humanity doesn’t make serious changes to the way we treat our Earth, the majestic Arctic baboons that spend their days scouring Regis Philbin’s graying locks for insects could end up lost forever, and photos like this will become haunting reminders of the world as it once was. Even if we manage to change our course from the calamitous environmental upheaval we’re heading towards, it might still be too late for the noble pair of friends captured in this photograph, who may have already met a tragic fate in the waters of the Arctic Ocean as the last fragments of their home melted away. The incredible mutualistic relationship that has evolved between the Arctic’s baboons and the television host whose hair provides them with a steady diet of ticks is one of the true marvels of the natural world, and if we can’t bring ourselves to give up fossil fuels within the next decade, future generations will never have the chance to see these wonderful creatures for themselves.

The Perils Of Fame: Hundreds Of Screaming Teenage Fangirls Are Currently Chasing The Colgate Toothpaste CEO Through The Streets Of New York City,"Being a celebrity certainly may have its perks, but right now, a scene is unfolding in New York that proves fame can have a dark side, too: Hundreds of screaming teenage fangirls are currently chasing the Colgate Toothpaste CEO through the streets of New York City.
Poor guy—on the one hand, it was his choice to pursue a life in the spotlight at Colgate, but it must be hard to deal with armies of screaming fans on a daily basis.

It was just about 11 this morning when the one and only Ian M. Cook, beloved CEO of Colgate-Palmolive, emerged from a building in New York’s financial district and made the mistake of taking off his hat, revealing his telltale graying hair to the public. Within seconds, a frenzy of giddy teenage girls had spotted Mr. Cook and started lining up to get selfies with him, begging the CEO to let them shake or at least touch one of the hands that types out all of the big-picture emails for the Colgate corporation at large.
The throngs of sobbing, shrieking fans continued to follow Ian even as he tried to slip away down a side street, and before long, a full-on stampede of starstruck young women was chasing the Colgate CEO down Broadway.
Yikes. Seems like a day in the life of the Colgate CEO is just as intense as it is glamorous.

Unfortunately, once word got around social media that the head executive of one of America’s premier toothpaste manufacturers was out walking in NYC, Mr. Cook’s location went viral, and now dedicated Colgate fans from all over New York are arriving in droves with ready-to-sign glossy photos of the Colgate CEO, from vintage photos of when he was just the chairman of Colgate’s Board of Directors to the iconic, beloved portrait of him that appears on the “about our company” page of the Colgate website.
Even when Ian finally managed to duck into a luxury cab and speed off, there were still dozens of determined teenagers continuing to sprint after his vehicle, screaming and wailing for “Mr. Colgate” to notice them for almost two miles.

"Improving Journalism: The Washington Post Is
Changing Its Slogan To ‘Democracy Dies In Darkness, Fascism Dies In Light, Read
The Washington Post Each Day To Make Your Brain All Right’","In 2017, The Washington Post adopted the slogan “Democracy Dies In Darkness.” It was a bold message affirming their mission to speak truth to power—and today, that slogan has been improved even further. On this morning’s front page, the paper once again changed their motto to “Democracy Dies In Darkness, Fascism Dies In Light, Read The Washington Post Each Day To Make Your Brain All Right.”
What an inspiring message. This is what quality journalism looks like!
In an editorial explaining the change, the Post wrote “Although our old slogan explained that democracy dies in darkness, it failed to also impart that fascism dies in light or that the public should read The Washington Post every day to make their brains all right. Our new and improved tagline adequately clarifies that when dictatorship rears its ugly head, onward forth our brave reporters tread. Through misinformation’s dreary fog, we march to the First Amendment’s valiant drumbeat, till each pertinent fact has been logged and printed upon our broadsheet.”

Wow. The Washington Post will stop at nothing to provide people with the information they need to understand what’s really going on in our country — and now they have a new slogan to prove it.
“Ne’er shall we falter, afraid to break a story,” continued the WaPo article. “Our editors will correct all typos and achieve eternal glory. Hush now, and listen for that approaching growl of beast! ’Tis the wolf of autocracy, hungrily stalking freedom through Washington, D.C.’s gloom-shrouded night. To thwart the hound’s bloodthirsty feast, our reporters look for scoops that will ignite the lantern of information’s light.” 
“Do not mistake this toast for an idle boast,” added the letter from the editors, “for the gleaming hoard of Pulitzers upon our shelf more than speaks for itself.”

“That is why we felt it was time to update our slogan again,” said the editorial in closing, stating that “we vow to defend the fourth estate with every last drop of blood that flows within our veins, and vex corrupt politicians with unending pains. We are the shield of knowledge that turns aside the arrow of lies, we are truth’s dauntless centurion patrolling the stalwart ramparts of your mind, protecting your intellect from censorship with each complex issue we summarize. We believe this vital goal is aptly summed up by our new catchphrase, a heroic creed which The Washington Post shall live up to forever and always.”
Wonderful! Now when people read The Washington Post’s motto, they’ll have a better idea of the important journalistic ideals the paper stands for. In these tumultuous political times, using the light of truth to kill fascism and make Americans’ brains all right is more important than ever.

Return Of The Fucking King: This College Freshman Poked His Whole Head Into His Old AP Lit Teacher's Room Right In The Middle Of Class,"For the students in Mr. Friedman’s AP Lit class, what started as a normal, boring lesson just turned into an unforgettable experience that everyone in attendance will undoubtedly be talking about for years to come: Connor Hanson, a college freshman who was in Mr. Friedman’s class last year, just poked his whole fucking head into the room right in the middle of class!
Yes! The motherfucking king is back! The former student council vice president himself has returned from college to his old stomping grounds so that the mortals who sit in the very desks he once occupied may bask in his glory!

Just minutes ago, Mr. Friedman was right in the middle of a sentence when Connor threw the door open and thrust his entire goddamn head into the room like a fucking Viking storming a castle. Mr. Friedman immediately stopped the lesson and shouted, “Well, look who’s back! How’s college life treating you, professor?” and Connor just laughed and said, “Oh, you know, I’m doing alright. Reading some Roland Barthes, who’s kicking my ass, but I finally think I understand him,” and Mr. Friedman gave him a knowing nod and then all the kids in the class looked at each other as if to say, “Who the fuck is Roland Barthes? This guy’s got to be a stone-cold genius to be throwing a name like that around.”
Connor, practically glowing with college wisdom, then looked at the class and said, “Make sure you listen up, everyone, because Mr. F knows what he’s talking about!” Then he gave Mr. Friedman a high-five like they were best friends and went on his way, leaving the the students in stunned silence. Everyone knew they had witnessed something truly special.
Even though Connor is gone and Mr. Friedman has resumed his lesson, the air in the classroom is still absolutely electric right now, and everyone’s heads are still spinning from their brush with greatness. This is definitely a moment that every single one of these students is going remember for the rest of their lives.

GoT Fans Rejoice: George R.R. Martin Says He Can Now Finish The Winds Of Winter Since Geico Has Given Him Legal Clearance To Use Their Gecko Mascot As A Character,"Game Of Thrones fans who have been eagerly awaiting the next installment in the book series finally have a reason to celebrate: George R.R. Martin says that he can now finish The Winds Of Winter because Geico has finally given him legal clearance to use their gecko mascot as a character!
Awesome! Looks like the long wait for The Winds Of Winter is coming to an end.
Martin announced earlier today that the completion of his next novel in the A Song Of Ice And Fire series had been delayed for several years because he wanted the Geico gecko to play an essential role in the storyline, but Geico had repeatedly threatened legal action over his plans to use their copyrighted material. The beloved fantasy author says he refused to compromise on using the character, as he felt it was critical to the book’s plot for the reptilian car insurance mascot to become romantically involved with several central characters, including Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen, adding that without the anthropomorphic lizard, the entire story arc of The Winds Of Winter would fall apart.

“I’m excited to announce that after a protracted legal battle with Geico, I am now able to publish The Winds Of Winter the way I intended: With their British-accented gecko character appearing in a majority of the scenes and ultimately saving the entire land of Westeros,” Martin wrote in a statement on his official website. “I experimented with calling this character ‘The Insurance Lizard’ and ‘The Wise Green Car Animal,’ but it just wasn’t the same. There’s a whole chapter where Cersei Lannister buys motorcycle insurance after kissing the Geico gecko, so if I changed the character in any way, that whole scene just wouldn’t make any sense. But now that Geico has agreed not to sue me for copyright infringement, I can finally finish the book just as I envisioned it.”
Awesome!
Fantasy fans everywhere have been patiently waiting a long time for this news, and it’s exciting that they’ll now finally get to discover what happens next in the Game Of Thrones saga. Kudos to Geico for allowing GRRM to use their intellectual property—they’ve just made millions of readers all around the world very, very happy.

“The FCC works tirelessly to protect our nation’s youth from potentially damaging content, but as far as anime goes, we don’t know what to tell you, because we straight-up don’t know what we’re looking at here,” the statement reads. “We’ve thoroughly reviewed dozens of anime shows, and although they usually start out with a bunch of vaguely magical cartoon characters like your safe, run-of-the-mill Nickelodeon show, they throw so much at you that after a while it’s tough to know if it’s appropriate or not. On one hand, every character seems to be, like, 14 years old, and there’s usually a talking cat or rabbit or whatever in their crew, which seems great for kids. But then all of a sudden, several shredded warriors will fly into the scene and graphically gut one of the teenagers with a lightsaber in slow motion for, like, five full minutes, which somehow kills the kid but also turns them into a dragon? We honestly don’t know if that’s an accurate description of what we saw, and that’s our big problem.”
“For every innocent physical gag where a character trips in the school hallway in front of their crush, there are an equal number of moments where a teenager will blush in a super sexual-seeming way for basically no reason, which somehow prompts their strong, blue turtle fellow of a sidekick to morph his own head into the head of a human baby, all before he gets decapitated by a subway,” the FCC’s statement continued. “We never have any goddam idea what’s happening in these shows, and thus we are unable to determine if anime is insanely damaging for kids to watch or educational or neutral or what.”

Yikes. If you’re the parent of a child who loves anime, this certainly isn’t the development you’ve been waiting for. Hopefully, the FCC can get a feel on what’s happening in anime sooner than later so that we can finally get a verdict on whether kids should be watching it.",NaN,2018-12-05T14:14:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--cjhh7O0d--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/twt5qgcjthjagq7cfa7b.jpg",Fake

Exonerated? New Evidence Reveals That Steven Avery Likely Couldn’t Have Killed Teresa Halbach Because He Was Transformed Into A Bird At The Time Of The Murder,"The controversy over Steven Avery’s involvement in Teresa Halbach’s murder, depicted on hit Netflix docuseries Making A Murderer, has had viewers wondering about the possibility of Avery’s innocence for years. But now, a bombshell revelation might just be enough to exonerate him: New evidence has revealed that Avery likely could not have killed Teresa Halbach because he was transformed into a bird at the time of the murder.
After a protracted legal battle that has left America confounded, could this be the evidence that exonerates Avery once and for all?

This week, Avery’s lead defense lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, filed a motion detailing new evidence that the defense claims could prove Avery was incapable of killing and dismembering Halbach due to the fact that he had been transfigured into a beautiful American kestrel on the afternoon the murder occurred. According to the document, multiple witnesses have come forward to testify that on the afternoon of October 31, they saw Avery disappear in a flash of light, leaving only a delicate Falco sparverius where he had been standing. 
“At about 3 p.m. on the day of the murder, I was standing on the side of the road when I saw Steven walk towards me. That was when he stopped for a second, then all of a sudden turned into a bird and just flew away,” read the testimony from Denny Tritz, a mailman in Avery’s hometown of Manitowoc County, WI. “He started out big, but then he became tiny, sprouted feathers, and let out a real loud screech before flapping his wings and soaring into the sky.” 
If that testimony isn’t convincing enough, a waitress at a nearby diner who watched the transformation take place from across the street took a cell phone video of the event, which shows a slightly blurry Avery dematerializing in a burst of light particles from which a medium-sized bird immediately emerges.

Wow. These witness’ accounts might be just what the defense needs to counter the prosecution’s claims.
The document filed by Avery’s defense also includes an analysis from a panel of forensics experts who have determined that the blood spatter patterns in Teresa’s RAV4 and Avery’s garage are not consistent with the type of violence that a medium-sized bird would be able to achieve. 
“Given that it seems Avery was only about 30 cm in length and 4 oz in weight at the time of the crime—in addition to the fact that he had talons and wings but no hands—he would neither have been able to stab and strangle Teresa, nor handle the .22 rifle that was used to shoot her,” wrote blood spatter analyst Colin Deslisle. “The most he would have been able to do to Teresa would  have been to scratch and peck at her, which would not have created the type of cast-off pattern seen at the scene of the murder.”

Incredible. This new evidence really may be the key to cracking open the Steven Avery case at long last. We’re excited to see how the lawyers on either side of the case are able to incorporate it into their arguments if the trial reopens. Whatever happens in Steven Avery’s story, this revelation will likely be a big turning point.

Nature Is Beautiful: A New Study Has Shown That When A Blue Whale Dies Its Body Can Feed Scientists For 3 Whole Years,"As the largest animals to have ever lived, blue whales are widely regarded as among the most extraordinary creatures on the planet, yet researchers have now determined that these gentle giants are even more incredible than previously believed: A new study has shown that when a blue whale dies, its body can feed scientists for three whole years.
Wow! Nature truly is amazing!
Following an exhaustive three-year study, marine biologists at Duke University discovered that the carcass of a 300,000-pound blue whale, if properly divided into Tupperware containers and stored in refrigerators, can sustain a 15-person team of hungry researchers for several years on end—proving that these majestic animals continue contributing to ecosystems long after their deaths. The well-fed team found that once a blue whale dies, researchers will scavenge not only the cetacean’s fins and flanks for meat but also its brain, eyes, and sexual organs, wasting no part of the animal as they divide its flesh up into hundreds of manageable chunks to be equally distributed amongst themselves and their research assistants, supplying them with enough food to last them for every single breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 36 consecutive months.

“We’d hypothesized that one might get tired of only eating whale for such a long period of time, but we were surprised to discover that the meat is remarkably versatile, essentially serving as a blank caloric canvas for whatever delicious spices, marinades, or sauces one is craving,” said Dr. Thomas Westman, the study’s lead researcher. “It took millions of years of evolutionary adaptations for these animals to develop such choice cuts of meat, and the fact that one can eat nothing but blue whale for three years and not get sick of it is an incredible testament to the perfect economy of nature’s design.”
Dr. Westman noted that even once a blue whale’s carcass has been picked completely clean of its meat, researchers will utilize the remaining bones to create delectable marrow- and broth-based dishes—a phenomenon that reveals the astonishing efficiency of the food chain and the critical role that even the mightiest species play in supporting the life around them.
Whoa. That is so awesome!
Just when we thought blue whales couldn’t get any cooler, they go ahead and prove how magical they are once again. And to think that there’s still so much we have yet to learn about these beautiful, mysterious creatures. Nature is seriously freaking amazing!

Body Positivity Win! People Seem To Be Fascinated With This Woman’s Huge Goiter ,"In a world where women are still all too often held to unrealistic beauty standards, here’s a story that just might restore your faith in humanity: This woman has a huge goiter, and people seem to be generally fascinated by it.
Body positivity FTW!
When 47-year-old Nancy Thomas developed a thyroid issue that caused a large, bulbous growth to develop on her neck, she was worried that people might be upset by her unusual appearance. But to her pleasant surprise, the reaction has been quite the opposite, as it turns out that children and adults alike are enthralled by Nancy’s goiter, often coming up to her in public to look at it, touch it with their fingers, or even take pictures of it. Whether she’s at work, at the gym, or shopping at the grocery store, Nancy is constantly surrounded by inquisitive onlookers who are transfixed by the sight of the massively enlarged gland on her neck.

It was entirely reasonable for Nancy to fear how people might react to her goiter, since physical abnormalities and “imperfections” sadly don’t fit into America’s very narrow beauty ideals. Yet instead, she’s now more popular than ever, so much so that she can barely leave her house without strangers asking her questions like “How big is that thing?” and “What’s inside there? Blood?” The fact that people seem more curious than repulsed by the humongous flesh-balloon wobbling from her neck is an encouraging indicator that society may be making important progress in terms of body acceptance.
Yes! All bodies truly are beautiful!
This just goes to show that the body positivity movement really is changing the way we perceive and treat those around us, and people of all body types should feel empowered by Nancy’s story to proudly flaunt what they’ve got. So goiter or no goiter, get out there and love yourself, because the world is changing for the better!

The 4 Medical Conditions That You Can Have,"Feeling unwell? Every last disease, injury, and ailment that you can possibly have falls into one of the following classifications. Consult this list of the only four medical conditions to begin diagnosing your health problems. 
There are thousands of ways in which the medical condition of “fat” can manifest. Too fat? That’s a fat problem. Too small? That’s a fat problem. Pregnant? Also a fat problem. In fact, cases of fat are on the rise across the world, with doctors diagnosing patients as “little fellas gone big” or “big boys gone slender” with increasing regularity.  Fat symptoms may come on suddenly and often include growing, shrinking, being of a size, and experiencing width.

If you have to go to the doctor’s office or hospital for any reason at all, you may be showing early signs of cancer. One of the biggest telltale signs that your body has developed cancer is being inside a health clinic where doctors and nurses are. Other urgent signs include baldness and laying in a bed, and if you find yourself experiencing these symptoms in tandem with each other, such as being bald and laying in a bed, contact a medical professional immediately to seek early treatment. It could save your life. 
Odds are, when you are feeling like your legs are not there, you’re likely experiencing what medical researchers have referred to as “no legs.” This extremely common malady can make basic tasks such as stomping, kicking, wearing shoes, and sprinting across the desert abnormally difficult. Luckily, this condition is easily treated with legs.

Out of the four health issues that there are, insanity is by far the most dire and easily contracted. Symptoms of insanity range in severity, the mildest of which include being a lunatic or the desire to be a maniac. The most extreme symptoms of being insane include having weird eyes, getting bad grades at school, and screaming. If you suffer from insanity, don’t worry, because there are tons of people who are insane but still lead fully functional and happy lives, such as Sully Sullenberger, Missy Elliot, and Don Zimmer.

Gearing Up For 2020? Bernie Sanders Just Slapped Barron Trump In The Face And Called Him A Bimbo,"While it’s still unclear what the candidate pool will look like for the 2020 presidential election, one popular politician just sent what seems to be a pretty strong signal that he’s gearing up to run: Bernie Sanders just slapped Barron Trump in the face and called him a bimbo.
Yep, it’s definitely looking like Bernie’s got his eye on the Oval Office.
The junior senator from Vermont made his presidential aspirations unmistakably clear earlier today when he stormed through the doors of the elite private school where Barron is a student, grabbed the 12-year-old by the collar, and slapped him hard across the face, leaving a bright red handprint on the boy’s right cheek.

“Go suck an egg, bimbo!” barked Sanders as he struck the child, eliciting gasps from onlookers who likely immediately recognized the huge implications the violent gesture would have on the 2020 race. “And tell your old man to suck an egg, too, you piss-licking ignoramus! You ass-brained coward! You long, bald skunk! Why, I oughtta—”
Sanders then tried to slap Barron a second time but was subdued by the boy’s Secret Service detail, which dragged the 77-year-old Democratic Socialist away as he continued to yell belligerently about how the United States of America needs leaders who will work for all people, not just the 1 percent. And though Sanders didn’t go as far as formally announcing a presidential bid, he teased his higher-office ambitions one more time while being carried out of the school, shouting that he would one day convert Barron’s playroom in the White House into a “sauna where I can walk on my elliptical” and that he would “issue an executive order to deport your dead-eyed mother back to Yugoslavia”—exactly the type of bold, forward-thinking rhetoric you’d expect out of someone hoping to become America’s next commander in chief.
Wow. Though we’ve just barely made it past the midterms, it already seems like election season is about to swing back into full gear, and if today’s events are any indication, it looks like it’ll be Bernie Sanders leading the charge on the campaign trail.

"A Hero’s Reward: George H.W. Bush Is Sitting In
Valhalla Nervously Drinking A Glass Of Water While Dead Vikings Battle Around Him","After a lifetime of public service, America’s 41st commander in chief has passed on to his eternal reward. President George H.W. Bush is currently sitting in Valhalla, nervously drinking a glass of water while Vikings battle around him.
Farewell, sir! Although you may be a little out of your element, you’ve more than earned your spot amongst the brave Norse warriors joyously reveling in the afterlife with endless wine and warfare.

Although the 94-year-old didn’t die a heroic death in battle, apparently being a U.S. veteran and presiding over the Gulf War was enough for the former president to gain admittance to Odin’s mead hall. There Mr. Bush rests enshrined in glory, sitting hunched over at a long oaken table and trying to ignore the boisterous Viking berserkers constantly dismembering each other with battle axes and spears, only to laugh as their wounds are magically healed so they might fight anew. Valkyrie shield-maidens offered to bring Mr. Bush a drinking horn of honey-wine that he might quaff to satisfy his thirst between violent melees, but the deceased POTUS instead asked them to bring him a glass of water with one ice cube. He is now trying to remain very quiet so nobody in Valhalla pays attention to him as they slaughter each other with reckless abandon. 
When not taking occasional small sips from his cup of water, Mr. Bush keeps his hand covering the top of the glass to protect his beverage from the splattering blood and viscera. He might not entirely feel at ease amongst the gory festivity, but with his anxious silence, the elder Bush is still displaying the civility and class he brought to the Oval Office.
George H.W. Bush may have only served one term as president, but he will spend thousands of years amongst the joyful, bloodthirsty Norsemen, sitting quietly with his glass of water until the end of days when the wolf Fenrir breaks free of its chain and all the warriors of Valhalla must fight alongside Odin in the final apocalyptic battle of Ragnarok. It is the highest honor a dead Viking raider could ever hope for, and it’s wonderful that George H.W. Bush is there, too. Goodbye, Mr. President! America salutes you!

The Power Of Love: Phil Margera Is Piloting A Hot-Air Balloon To London To Win Back The Heart Of Meghan Markle And Take Her On A Romantic Vacation,"If grand romantic gestures aren’t your thing, you might want to stop reading now, because this is a story of a man who is going to truly extraordinary lengths to prove his love to the woman of his dreams: Phil Margera is piloting a hot-air balloon over to London to win back the heart of Meghan Markle and take her on a romantic vacation.
Beautiful! This is seriously like something straight out of a fairy tale.
According to sources, Margera is currently flying a hot-air balloon at very high speeds over the Atlantic Ocean in desperate pursuit of his ex-girlfriend Markle, whom he broke up with over 10 years ago at the height of his Viva La Bam fame so he could play the field and enjoy the perks of his celebrity.

Having since realized that Markle is the love of his life and that dumping her was an enormous mistake, the 61-year-old Jackass star is now hurtling through the skies en route to London, where his former flame moved earlier this year to be with another man. Wearing absolutely nothing except for a flirty white pair of briefs and brandishing a box of Buncha Crunch and some roses he picked up for Markle at the gas station, it’s clear that Margera is pulling out all the stops to woo the woman he loves.
“I love you, Meghan Markle, and I’m going to marry you and start a family with you at my house in Pennsylvania, just like you always wanted!” shouted Margera just moments ago, still thousands of miles from land, while waving a homemade sign reading “DON’T BE A NUCKLEHEAD—GET BACK WITH PHIL.” “I’m sorry that I dumped you, Meghan, but I’ve since become a better man and now I’m ready to be the supportive partner you deserve! Please, take me back! I brought you some delicious Buncha Crunch to show you how sorry I am!”
“We’ll have the perfect life together!” Margera continued. “We’ll play cards all the time and listen to Bloodhound Gang and hang out with Preston and Wee Man—just like we always dreamed!”

Margera went on to declare that if Markle agrees to get back together with him, then he’ll take her on a fabulous, romantic vacation to one of the top-rated resorts in the Wisconsin Dells and that Preston, Wee Man, and his wife April can come along, too, and they’ll all have a kickass time together, just like the good old days. However, it still remains to be seen whether or not Margera will actually survive the journey to London, as he is currently unwittingly steering his hot-air balloon directly into the spiraling outer bands of a powerful tropical storm, the violent winds of which will likely destroy his balloon and send him crashing down into the ocean. Yet anything is possible with the power of love, and come hell or high water, it’s clear that Margera is willing to do whatever it takes to win back his sweetheart.
Whatever ends up happening, this is already shaping up to be one of the most beautiful love stories of all time. Here’s hoping Phil is at least able to survive the journey over the Atlantic and confess his true feelings to Meghan so that both of them don’t have to spend the rest of their lives wondering about what might’ve been.

The Future Of Agriculture: Dole Just Engineered An Apple That Grows With A Toy In It To Encourage Kids To Eat More Fruit,"Anyone who has children has tried countless tactics to get them to eat more fruits and vegetables, but one major produce distributor may have just found an amazing way to use science in order to solve the age-old struggle of parents worldwide: The Dole Food Company just genetically engineered an apple that grows with a toy in it to encourage kids to eat more fruit!
Finally! Thanks to Dole, the kids of the future will actually beg their parents for nutritious apples with toys inside of them instead of pizza and fries.

After years of development, genetic engineers at Dole have used cutting-edge biotechnology to create a breed of apple that can grow an okay-looking plastic figurine inside of it. Now when children bite into a Granny Smith or a Gala, they might just see the face of a toy soldier looking back at them from inside their healthy snack! Dole even has plans to partner with companies like Disney and Nickelodeon to one day grow figurines of classic characters like SpongeBob SquarePants or Mickey Mouse inside various types of fruit.
“We at Dole are very excited about the possibilities of growing toys inside of apples, and we hope to expand our technology to the point where the toys that grow inside our produce are not filled with seeds,” said Jill Arnold, the head of Dole’s biotechnology department. “For the time being, the toys present a dangerous choking hazard, so we recommend that parents supervise their children while eating any fruits that grow their own prizes, but nevertheless we’re beyond thrilled that we’ve been able to make nutritious snacking fun for children.”
Wow. There’s no doubt that kids are about to go wild for Dole’s new toy-filled apples. The company even says that they’re working on a method for making the toys non-toxic so that children no longer become sick when they eat their fruit!

"Rules Are Rules: Jeff Bezos
Was Just Fired From Amazon For Getting A Tattoo","Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos may be the richest person on Earth, but he still has to follow the rules like everyone else. Bezos just found that out the hard way when he was fired from Amazon for getting a tattoo.
Sorry, Jeff, but rules are rules. Just because you have $156 billion doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want.

The firing went down yesterday, when Bezos arrived for work at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters sporting a large, freshly inked tattoo of Pegasus on his neck and face, which, though tastefully done, was in clear violation of the company’s policy on visible skin art. He was immediately pulled aside by two HR managers, who informed him that, as an employee who often interacts with important clients and investors, they felt that his tattoo gave him an unprofessional appearance that would hinder his ability to effectively represent the company moving forward.  They added that had Bezos gotten a small tattoo on his arm or lower back that could be covered up by clothing, perhaps Amazon could have looked the other way, but the reality is that his new tattoo is enormous and goes way above his shirt collar, making it impossible not to notice.
After the company informed him that his employment was being terminated, Bezos was given only half an hour to pack his personal effects into a cardboard box before security escorted him out of the building. It’s harsh, but to be fair, Bezos was fully aware of the company’s no-visible-tattoos policy yet still decided to get inked up anyway.
Bezos is going to have to dust off his résumé and look for another job, but it might be hard for him to find new work now that he has a huge tattoo covering his neck and face. You can’t help but feel sorry for the guy, but by violating Amazon’s rules on tattoos he completely brought this on himself.

Historic Exhibit: Barack Obama’s Bones Are On Display At The Smithsonian,"All you history buffs out there are going to want to clear some space in your calendar and plan a trip to Washington, DC to see an absolutely unforgettable new exhibit! Nearly two years after completing his historic presidency, Barack Obama’s bones are currently on display at the Smithsonian for the first time!
This is an incredible opportunity to get a firsthand look at the 44th president’s skeleton up close and in person!

As of Monday of this week, the full set of bones of former U.S. President Barack Obama, who served from 2008 to 2016, can be seen at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History’s new exhibit dedicated to his life and presidency. Obama’s skeleton, which up to this point had been stored underground in an archive beneath the museum and away from public view, has been fully reconstructed by some of the nation’s top paleontologists, and the display will give visitors the chance to observe for themselves the size and stature of the “Yes We Can” president whose inauguration and presidency still represent hope for much of the country.
Seriously, this is not something any fans of American history are going to want to miss. Anybody who can make the trip will not regret taking the time to witness the skeleton of the groundbreaking commander in chief who helped pass the Affordable Care Act and who was in the situation room as Osama bin Laden was brought to justice in 2011.
Along with President Obama’s bones, the exhibit also includes a replica of the former president’s Nobel Peace Prize, as well as the skull of his beloved pet dog, Bo. This is pretty much as close as you can get to actually meeting Barack Obama in person!

President Obama’s incredible legacy as the first African American president and a progressive icon deserves to be remembered and honored, which is why it’s so awesome that the Smithsonian has made his skeleton available for the world to see for the first time!

Science Win: Anthropologists Now Believe Neanderthals Had Big Stupid Grins On Their Faces Pretty Much All The Time,"Researchers have just announced an incredible scientific discovery that could completely change the way we understand one of mankind’s closest evolutionary relatives: According to a groundbreaking new study, anthropologists now believe that Neanderthals had big stupid grins on their faces pretty much all the time.
Whoa. This is a seriously major breakthrough!
Following an exhaustive five-year study, a team of researchers at Oxford University says it’s uncovered incontrovertible proof that Neanderthals were more or less just always strolling around and smiling like idiots, their lips spread so wide that their faces basically looked horizontally bisected in a Muppet-like fashion. Knowing that Neanderthals were constantly sporting huge, goofy-ass grins that fully bared their teeth and gums could have massive implications on how we perceive these early ancestors and what their role was in the emergence of modern humans.

“By digitally overlaying the muscle and tissue structure over jaw fossils gathered from across Europe, it’s evident that Neanderthals always had big, shit-eating grins on their faces that would bug the hell out of everyone they came into contact with,” said Dr. Sarah Ellens, the study’s lead researcher. “We’ve known for some time that Neanderthals were adept at using tools, but, interestingly, when we analyze oxidation levels on teeth and dental fragments, what we find is that basically no matter what they were doing—whether banging away with their hammers, hunting animals, or huddling for warmth—their mouths were pretty much always hanging wide open, smiling ear-to-ear with obnoxious, self-satisfied looks plastered on their faces.”
Dr. Ellens continued to say that by studying things like the Neanderthals’ cave etchings, larynx structures, and social patterns, her team was also able to conclude that they were probably always whistling made-up, silly little songs to themselves and giving big friendly hellos to passersby. The researchers posit that this happy-go-lucky behavior was likely a primary contributing factor to the species’ eventual extinction, as late Neanderthals’ eagerness to walk up very close to members of emerging Homo sapiens populations and smile at them from less than an inch away almost certainly exposed them to the foreign viral pathogens that would wipe their kind from the face of the earth. Yet even as their entire species was being mercilessly annihilated by horrific disease, researchers say the Neanderthals nonetheless continued to sport their ridiculous shit-eating grins, utterly oblivious to their dire circumstances.
Amazing!
The importance of these new discoveries cannot be overstated, as the revelation that Neanderthals constantly had gigantic wacky smiles on their faces will forever change the way we study and perceive our early ancestors. Someone get the Nobel Committee on the phone, because this is, without a doubt, the biggest scientific breakthrough of the year.

Definitely A Psychopath: This Kid Just Chose To Paint A Regular White Plate At His Friend’s Ceramic Painting Party,"A deeply troubling situation is currently unfolding at 9-year-old Charlie DiMarie’s ceramic painting party, where one child is currently doing something truly psychotic that has left everyone around him pretty unsettled: While all the other children were working on rainbow piggy banks or polka-dotted mugs with glitter and sparkles, this kid decided to spend the entire party painting a regular white ceramic plate with nothing but more white paint.
Jesus Christ. This definitely seems like the sort of thing you think back to when a kid grows up to be a murderer later in life.

The insane child in question is Jeremy Pearson, who seemed totally normal up until it was time for all the kids to pick a ceramic item to paint and Jeremy went straight for a nondescript dinner plate that he excitedly declared he was going to paint “as blank as I can.” When Jeremy went to choose his paints, several adults tried to offer him cool colors to use, but he refused them all and instead asked for “three different bottles of white paint,” which he then mixed together to get a color he repeatedly referred to as “Absolute Blank.”
It seems like maybe this kid’s idea of fun is just the color white on a plate, and if that’s true, something is absolutely wrong with him.
At one point it looked like Jeremy might be adding some decoration to his plate when he grabbed a butterfly-shaped stencil, but then he just used it to paint a white butterfly onto a white background, which was oddly terrifying to watch. Later, when someone asked Jeremy if he was planning to give the plate to his dad or something, he calmly replied, “The plate is for no one,” and continued painting in silence.

Probably the most disturbing thing Jeremy did all day, however, was at the end of the party, when he finished painting, held up his plate, and whispered “It is perfect, now it is complete” to nobody in particular with his eyes closed.
After watching Jeremy paint his plain white plate, there’s little doubt that there is something not entirely right with this kid. People should definitely keep a close eye on this tiny little madman, because it’s pretty clear that this child is completely unhinged.",NaN,2018-11-28T12:29:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--BUqgSWxS--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/i8qkvhxpacktgmusto0u.jpg",Fake
4 Episodes Of ‘Barefoot Contessa’ Where Jeffrey Got Stuck In Traffic On His Way Home So Ina Garten Pretended To Be Him And Ate His Dinner,"Barefoot Contessa host Ina Garten loves sharing the delicious meals she makes with her husband, Jeffrey, at the end of each episode, but unfortunately, Jeffrey doesn’t always make it back from work in time. Here are four episodes of Barefoot Contessa where Jeffrey got stuck in traffic on his way home so Ina Garten pretended to be him and ate his dinner.
On this season 13 episode, Ina had just put the finishing touches on a rotisserie chicken with satay dip when she received a call from Jeffrey explaining that due to some traffic, he wouldn’t make it back to the Hamptons for a few more hours. She immediately hung up the phone, looked directly into the camera, and said, “Ding dong. Jeffrey’s home!” before heading offscreen, only to return a minute later wearing a short gray wig, sunglasses, and an oversized black peacoat. “It’s me, Jeffrey! Wearing my Jeffrey coat!” Ina announced, before taking her husband’s seat at the table and scarfing down curried chicken salad while saying, “I love my wife, Ina, who did all this chicken just for me.” After eating all the food, Ina shouted, “Yum yum, dinner!” and claimed that this was Jeffrey’s famous catchphrase before the episode cut to some B-roll of a farmers market with soft mambo music playing over it.

It seemed like Ina had a hunch that her husband would hit some traffic during this 2015 episode because she didn’t hesitate to suit up in her Jeffrey costume when he wasn’t home in time to enjoy ribeye steaks alongside her celebrity guests Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka. “Howdy do, my wife’s guests! I’m Jeffrey and it’s time to eat! Yum yum, dinner!” shouted Ina as she adjusted the sagging wig and started digging in. When Neil Patrick Harris politely asked Ina what she was doing, she responded, “Ina’s sick and in the hospital. But fortunately I’m Jeffrey and it’s dinnertime.” They reluctantly started eating in silence, but because Ina could tell they weren’t convinced, she said, “If I weren’t Jeffrey, would I have this?” and pulled a men’s bathing suit out of a gym bag. They didn’t answer, but their discomfort was obvious as Ina gulped down both her and Jeffrey’s negronis while saying, “Being Jeffrey makes me sooo thirsty!” 
Ina had just finished making fettuccine with white truffle butter and mushrooms when she pretended to be Jeffrey once again. Opting for a new Jeffrey costume that she felt was more convincing, she arrived back on the patio with tin foil wrapped around her head and several dishtowels draped over her body and said, “Work at Yale was amazing but it doesn’t come close to my wife’s pasta!” However, the highways weren’t as bad as Ina expected, so just as she declared that the ginger shortbread cookies passed something she just made up called “Jeffrey’s Famous Dessert Test,” the actual Jeffrey walked out to the garden. In a panicked attempt to maintain her charade, Ina proceeded to point at Jeffrey and yell, “Ah, there’s my lovely wife, Ina! I’m Jeffrey who works at Yale but eats right in this chair! Yum yum, dinner!” Jeffrey quietly took in the scene for a moment, then walked back into the house. Unfortunately, Ina forgot to take off the costume during the closing “Ask Ina” segment, so when a viewer asked, “Can you substitute mozzarella for burrata?” she answered, “Why would you ask me, Jeffrey, dean emeritus of the Yale School of Management, that question? You know who you should ask? Ina, my wife. Yum yum, dinner!” When another viewer asked, “Well, where’s Ina, then?” Ina replied, “Gone,” and refused to elaborate.

While it was definitely poor timing that Jeffrey got stuck in traffic during his birthday celebration in the season 22 opener,  Ina clearly had a plan B to manage the situation. When the show cut from the cooking segment to the meal, Ina was wearing a mask she’d made from a photo of Jeffrey with the eyes poked out, eating Jeffrey’s birthday sautéed chard across from a head of cauliflower with a face drawn on it in hollandaise sauce that was attached to a broom. “What a delightful meal you made for me, Ina!” exclaimed Ina as she stroked the side of the cauliflower broom, “You have made me the happiest Jeffrey in the world. I’m 100 years old.” She then pressed play on a boombox and began tenderly slow-dancing to Taylor Swift’s “Welcome To New York” with the cauliflower broom as she tearfully declared, “Ina, you look just as beautiful as you did the night we met 100 years ago,” before sneaking in a final “Yum yum, dinner!” chant as the credits started to roll.",NaN,2018-11-28T10:16:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s---Mikq5J8--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/qebddzuesua0a6dls0c9.jpg",Fake

"Next Time You See An Old Person Alone At A Restaurant, Know That It Would Mean The World To Them If You Ate Them Out Right There Under The Table","The sight of an elderly person eating by themselves in public can be simply heartbreaking. It’s often a stark reminder that as we grow older, we lose the ones we love and face deep, painful loneliness. Social isolation is a growing epidemic for senior citizens in America, but it doesn’t have to be. Even the smallest gesture can go a long way, so the next time you see an old person alone at a restaurant, know that it would mean the world to them if you ate them out right there under the table.
Your time is the greatest gift you can give. Taking just five minutes out of your day to go down on an elderly person could make their entire week.

Imagine this: You’re in your 70s, widowed, and have fallen out of touch with close friends. Your days are spent quietly watching TV, hoping for visitors at your retirement home, and having meals alone. When you witness an elderly person eating in public by themselves, that’s likely their everyday reality. All it would take for someone to break that senior’s crushing solitude is to approach them with a smile, shake their hand, get down on all fours, crawl under their table, and engage them in a friendly bout of oral sex. It may not seem like much, but 30 minutes of genital motor-boating is all it takes to remind a senior citizen that they’re valued, visible members of our society.
You’ll know by the twinkle in their eye when you finally lift your head out of their crotch that you’ve made a lasting difference in their lives.
Letting an old person fuck your face can be an incredibly rewarding act of kindness, and there’s absolutely no reason to be anxious about it. Sure, you grew up in a totally different time period, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to have stimulating fellatio or cunnilingus with a senior. They’re a person like anyone else. Treat them to the same deep-throating and tonguing techniques that you would someone of your own generation, and you’ll find it’s easier than you’d expect to give senior citizens a hummer that results in a full-body explosion of pleasure.

In fact, a lot of young people today would be pleasantly surprised at how eager elderly people are to flip you upside down in the restaurant booth and reciprocate. Who knows? They very well might offer you a bit of sage, time-honored wisdom about eating pussy and sucking a penis.
So, the next time you find yourself dining out near an elder who has no one to keep them company, put yourself in their shoes for a moment, and consider the difference you can make. Loneliness can be particularly unbearable around the holiday season, so at this time of year it’s more meaningful than ever when you start blowing seniors underneath a table at McDonald’s. From my own personal experience, I can safely say it will be a bright spot in their lives that they’ll never forget.",NaN,2018-11-27T12:01:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--h-a9uee7--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/pdzcf72ydiqhfchc2e4q.jpg",Fake
Sexier Than Ever: Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Is Looking Amazing After Murdering His Uncle And Stealing His Wig,"Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was already one of the most attractive stars on the planet, but he somehow just found a way to be even hotter than he already was: Dwayne Johnson is looking absolutely amazing after murdering his uncle and stealing his wig.
Wow! He really is more gorgeous than ever now!
It seemed like it was impossible for Dwayne Johnson to get any more perfect, but the Jumanji star managed to achieve the impossible earlier this week when he strangled his uncle and pilfered the wig from his dead body, leaving him with a tasteful hairpiece that makes it look like he’s got a healthy shock of black hair on top of his beautiful head.

The Rock could be seen walking through Hollywood all day yesterday showing off his brand-new wig, which once belonged to his uncle and had for years aroused intense jealousy from the actor. Johnson says the desire to possess the wig ate away at him day and night, and when he finally could take it no longer, he murdered his uncle in cold blood so that he could have the wig. It’s a choice that definitely paid off, because now that he has his dead uncle’s wig, Dwayne is definitely looking younger and more confident.
Johnson addressed his recent acquisition of his uncle’s wig in a steamy tell-all article in GQ magazine, saying, “My uncle thought he could keep this wig all to himself, but I proved him wrong by strangling him in a parking garage, and now I am the one with the nice hair. My uncle screamed when I killed him, but he would not give me the wig any other way. Now I have the wig and I look amazing. I look like Paul McCartney.”
Swoon! We’d seriously give anything to score a date with this dreamboat!
Seeing how incredible Johnson looks now, we honestly wish he’d snapped his uncle’s neck and stolen his wig years ago. We’ll take The Rock any way he comes, but if you ask us, he looks sexiest when he’s sporting his dead uncle’s wig.

The 5 Times Dad Was Irrefutably In The Zone,"For the most part, Dad is a lame and boring man—a man who, like a toaster oven or mailbox, is largely a creature of utility, reliably doing what’s asked of him day in and day out with no detectable passion. So on the rare occasions when Dad does become emotionally invested in something, it’s a very exciting and memorable event. Here are the five times Dad was irrefutably in the zone.
From the very beginning of our 2010 family vacation to Punta Cana, it was clear that Dad was in special form. Having expertly navigated the family through airport customs in five minutes flat and having later flaunted his credit card status at the hotel check-in to get us upgraded to a room with a partial ocean view, everything was going the old man’s way, which is perhaps why he felt empowered to pull off a truly extraordinary Dad feat: haggling an $8 puka shell necklace down to $2. After leaving the resort grounds to check out a sketchy outdoor market someone on TripAdvisor had recommended, Dad spotted a puka shell necklace at a stand selling cheap beachy jewelry and picked it up off the rack. The worker at the stand said, “That’s yours for $8,” to which Dad replied without looking up from the puka shells, “This definitely isn’t worth $8—I saw the same necklace at another stand for $5.” Seemingly taken aback by the weird, insulting negotiation attempt, the worker then said, “I can’t just give this stuff away, man. But fine, $5.” And right then is when Dad proved without a doubt that he was, in fact, fucking feeling it, first bartering the necklace down even further to $4 and then threatening to walk away unless the worker went lower, ultimately forcing the poor guy to fold and drop the price to $2. Two motherfucking dollars! To this day, Dad still wears that puka shell necklace if he’s going out with his friends, and every time he puts it on, he’s sure to tell anyone who’ll listen that he haggled it down from $8 to $2 back in 2010, on a day when he was irrefutably crushing it.

When Dad fell off the ladder while cleaning out the gutters in June 2007, no one could have predicted that the dipshit move would end up putting him back in the zone for the first time in years, but that’s exactly what happened. As Dad hobbled his busted-up ass inside, hunched over in pain, Mom understandably freaked out and told him to sit down while she called an ambulance. That’s when Dad, visibly heating up for a performance for the ages, told her, “I’m not going anywhere. There’s nothing they can do for this at a hospital.” Mom fired back by frantically telling him that his collarbone was broken and needed to be looked at, to which Dad responded with heat check after heat check, like, “An ambulance ride costs $2,000” and “All they’re gonna tell me to do is rest it, and that’s what I’m doing right now.” Presumably seeing that Dad was firing on all cylinders, Mom eventually gave up on arguing and carefully put his arm in an old sling we had in the basement. The old man capped off his hot streak by popping six Advil and plopping down on the couch to watch Private Parts on VH1. To everyone’s surprise but Dad’s, his color was back after an hour or so and he was basically fully healed within the next few weeks, all without ever going to the doctor or anything. It was a truly monumental achievement that could’ve only happened as a result of Dad being very deep in the zone.
There was no indication that Dad was about to slip into the zone as he drove the family home from Josh’s middle-school graduation in May of 2009, and that only worked to make the whole thing that much more incredible. As Dad merged the family Toyota 4Runner onto the highway, the Classic Rewind channel on his SiriusXM radio began playing “Tom Sawyer” by Rush, and when the big synthy whooshing sound kicked the song off, Dad immediately started tapping along in absolutely perfect rhythm on the steering wheel, nailing every single part as if he’d been practicing for weeks. Using his right index finger to tap out the hi-hat parts on the bottom of his steering wheel, his left middle finger to slap the back of the wheel for a sharper snare sound, and his left foot to mimic the bass pedal, Dad was so flawlessly in sync with Neil Peart’s drumming that Josh asked Dad from the backseat if he used to play the drums, to which Dad responded by executing an amazingly timed fill on the dashboard, a move he briefly took both hands off the wheel to do. The song was still playing when we rolled into the driveway and Dad turned the car off, ending the show as abruptly as it had begun. But for that brief time during the first 80 percent of “Tom Sawyer,” everyone in that car felt like they were in the presence of greatness.

Another time Dad found himself in the zone while driving was around seven or eight years ago when we were going to a family dinner at Olive Garden and for some reason had to take two cars. As everyone was piling into the cars, Mom offhandedly said to Dad from her driver-side window, “Saw a speed trap on 276 yesterday, so be careful,” which prompted Dad to snap back with “I would never take 276 to get to Bloomville. County Line is way faster.” Mom responded by kind of laughing and shaking her head before pulling out of the driveway, and god knows why, but Dad seemed to take that as an insult to his manhood. The dude immediately peeled out of the driveway like a goddamn lunatic, barreling the car through the neighborhood at 40 mph—not even slowing for the “DEAF CHILD AT PLAY” sign—before turning onto County Line and then gunning it even faster. Tightly gripping the steering wheel with both hands like he was Jeff Gordon or some shit, Dad went on to pass about 15 cars as he flew up County Line, even though the road has those solid yellow stripes that mean you’re not allowed to pass people. He didn’t even fiddle with the radio or anything. The dude was just dialed in. And after somehow managing to breeze through about eight straight traffic lights along the route right as they were turning green, Dad finished off his magnum opus of a drive by cutting across the PNC Bank parking lot to get to the Olive Garden so he didn’t have to wait to turn at the intersection. Dad only ended up beating Mom by a minute or two, and he probably would’ve lost had he driven at a safe speed, indicating that Mom’s route was honestly probably quicker. But that’s besides the point. The dude was in the zone, and it was a beautiful thing to behold.
The annual white elephant exchange at the family Christmas party has long been the time when the adult men in the family go toe-to-toe in an alpha battle of wits, each using their loudest, most unnatural voice to try to make funny quips about the wacky presents being opened, and Dad won the 2003 showdown by a landslide. Although he’s easily one of the least funny old guys in the entire extended family, the stars just happened to align from the get-go for Dad in 2003. When Uncle Howard opened his first present, a bag of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee beans, Dad immediately declared, “Perfect, now you can have more energy to not exercise!” and all the old people in the room exploded with laughter, giving Dad the confidence to keep hamming it up. Whether it was Aunt Kathy opening an iPod Shuffle and Dad half-yelling, “Hope someone got her some hearing aids, too, so she can use it!” or Uncle Howard opening a pack of socks and Dad saying, “There you go Howie, some workout socks!” in a callback to the exercise joke from earlier, Dad had achieved some kind of special flow state, firing off an endless string of jokes that weren’t actually funny but that nonetheless made all the old people fall off their chairs laughing. Dad was so in the zone that eventually all the other old people stopped making quips altogether, knowing that Dad was in the midst of his own Michael Jordan Flu Game and that there was really no stopping him. It’s been years since that sensational 2003 white elephant performance, and although he’s tried every year since, Dad has never been able to recapture the magic he had on that day, when he was undoubtedly in the goddamn zone.

Sex-Ed FTW: This Pregnant Dog Visits Schools To Teach Children That Just Because You Have Huge Tits Doesn’t Mean They Always Look Good,"There’s no shortage of harmful messaging about beauty in our culture these days, but one awesome sex-ed initiative is spreading across the country to teach kids a healthier, more grounded understanding of body image: This pregnant dog visits schools to teach children that just because you have huge tits doesn’t mean they always look good.Yes! This is what responsible sex education looks like!From the moment they’re born, children in our society are conditioned to believe that huge breasts are always going to look amazing, but thanks to the efforts of a heavily pregnant 5-year-old beagle named Gingerbread, students across America are learning that “bigger is better” isn’t always the whole story when it comes to tits. With the help of her human handlers, Gingerbread has been visiting dozens of schools to show students that her distended mammary glands look bizarre and unappealing even though they’re enormous relative to the rest of her body, and in doing so she’s making thousands of kids aware of just how unrealistic their expectations of beauty really are.
“Movies and the internet have given a lot of these kids a very skewed idea of what an attractive body looks like, so seeing Gingerbread’s bulbous teats swing around under her whenever she walks helps these young people understand that massive boobs aren’t necessarily wonderful simply because they’re humongous,” said Richard Warner, a middle-school principal in Kansas City whose students are still talking about Gingerbread’s visit a month later. “I have students come up to ask me if Gingerbread can come back for another assembly so they can see how messed up her tits would look if she lay on her back, and that enthusiasm tells me that this amazing dog and her off-putting, engorged nipples have reached the students in a way no textbook ever could.”

‘Why Would A Cat Be Here?’: 5 Cheetos Commercials Where Chester Cheetah Openly Questions What The Hell He’s Doing In A Commercial For Cheese Snacks,"Chester Cheetah is one of the most iconic mascots in the snack biz. But Chester himself has often openly questioned why the hell he’s appearing in commercials for cheese puffs. Here are five such commercials you’ll undoubtedly remember from when you were a kid.
Chester made his debut commercial appearance in 1986 and immediately questioned what the hell he was doing there. The spot shows a group of snackintists hard at work on new crunchnology when Chester bursts through the door and shouts, “Things are about to get a little CHEESY in here!” and begins shredding on his mouth-shaped electric guitar, knocking over the Cheetoizer 2000. He says the tagline “It ain’t easy bein’ cheesy” as electricity shoots from the damaged machine. The commercial’s tone then turns on a dime when Chester begins asking the scientists in a measured, polite voice if they can think of any reason why he, a cheetah, would be in a Cheetos ad. The animated scientists simply freeze, as if the animators had stopped animating them, but Chester continues: “I mean, is it the ‘chee’ thing? Like, chee, cheese, chee, Cheetos, chee, cheetah, I get it, but it just seems like that’s not really enough to go with a cheetah. And also, are cheetahs really an animal you think of as sort of party dudes?” At this point, the commercial ends abruptly.

If you watched after-school shows in the ’90s, you’re going to remember this one. An unnamed Chester impostor, who looks just like him aside from the fact that he’s green instead of orange, has infiltrated Cheetos HQ to get his cheesy hands on the secret recipe for Cheetos Paws. Chester catches him in the act, leading to a humorous scene where both cheetahs believe they’re looking at their reflection in a mirror. While the expectation is that Chester is about to lay the smackdown on his imposter for his attempted robbery, Chester instead uses the opportunity to ask his fellow cheetah what the hell is going on with the whole cheetah-in-sunglasses thing. “Can I ask you something,” Chester urgently asks his doppelgänger. “What do you think is the deal with the cheetah thing? Does that relate to cheese somehow? A cheetah is a majestic animal known for its speed and hunting prowess. Cheetahs don’t eat cheese, they don’t produce cheese. There’s nothing to do with cheese snacks there.” While Chester continues with his questions, the impostor slides down a tube and slips away with the Cheetos Paws recipe.
This commercial aired around Christmas in 2008, and it depicts a sweat-drenched Chester hard at work in a volcano gathering the lava used to flavor Flamin’ Hot Cheetos into buckets. Suddenly, the volcano’s gate slams behind him. The face of his nemesis, Flamin’ Hot Fiona, appears on a monitor, and she cackles with laughter as the lava levels begin to rise. Chester calmly turns to the camera and says, “I mean, with Captain Crunch, the name of the cereal is Captain Crunch. That makes sense. The cereal is called Captain Crunch, so the mascot is a captain named Crunch. But in my case, I’m a cheetah named Chester. And I wear sunglasses and I’m, like, a really cool guy. I just don’t get it.” Finally, the lava engulfs his mouth and he stoically burns to death.

If you’ve got any old cartoons you taped off of TV with your VCR in the ’90s you’ve probably got this one on one of those tapes. In the ad, Chester flies his float plane to the Crunch-lapagos Islands, where he’s greeted by his Cheetah ancestors. His ancestors are fascinated by Chester’s sneakers and sunglasses, which they’ve never seen before. Chester passes out bags of Cheetos to all of them, and while they enjoy the boldly cheesy, mouth-pleasing crunch, Chester begins crying and confesses that he wishes he could be living in the wild with them as an apex predator hunting game as nature intended. “Honestly, I really question why I am here in this commercial. It’s not that I don’t love Cheetos, I do. It’s just that it doesn’t really make a lot of sense.” Chester’s lament is interrupted by a perky announcer grunting, “The cheese that goes crunch!”
The latest instance of Chester openly questioning what the hell he’s doing in a cheese snack commercial is quite recent, first airing in July of 2018. Chester is distracted by watching cool skateboarding videos on his phone and mistakenly pops a handful of Xxtra Flamin’ Hot Cheetos into his mouth, thinking they’re original Cheetos. Chester’s face turns bright red and flames immediately begin shooting out of his ears, curling through the air to form letters that spell out, “What am I doing here? I’ve been around for so long that no one questions it, but honestly, if you think about it, there are about a hundred mascots that should be in this commercial before me: a block of cheese, a cow, an ear of corn. But just because ‘cheetah’ sort of sounds like ‘Cheeto,’ I’m stuck with this? I should be the mascot for, like, a car or motorcycle company. Something fast. 1986—that’s when I started appearing in these commercials. There have probably been a billion dollars spent on ads since then, and they’re still going with Chester Cheetah. Occasionally I try to protest in these commercials hoping they’ll go another route after everyone realizes that it is pretty bizarre that I’m a Cheetah, but apparently this is the best they’ve got. Can’t complain about steady work, I suppose. It’s just… confusing is all.” Finally, Chester douses his head with a bucket of ice water, turning the flames jutting from his ears to smoke, spelling out, “Oh, well.”

5 Tactful Ways To Shut Down Jigsaw At Thanksgiving When He Starts Arguing In Favor Of Sadistic Death Traps,"When Thanksgiving rolls around and the whole family gets together, you can usually expect Jigsaw the serial killer to go on a long rant about how subjecting people to physical and psychological torture is the only way to test their will to live and determine whether they deserve to exist on Earth. We all know that those conversations usually just lead to fights and hurt feelings, so here are five tactful ways to shut down Jigsaw at Thanksgiving when he starts arguing in favor of sadistic death traps. 
1. Refute Jigsaw’s argument with straightforward facts.
Jigsaw never misses an opportunity to launch into a mid-dinner speech about how most people in this world are spoiled rotten and should be forced to fight for their lives so we can weed out the weak-willed. Thankfully, there’s an easy way to make Jigsaw realize that he doesn’t have the moral high ground on this one—come back at him with hard evidence. When Jigsaw starts talking about how the only people who deserve to live are the ones who are willing to saw off a pound of their own flesh and weigh it on a scale for him, you can say, “Actually, there are tons of people who are productive members of society but wouldn’t want to hack off their own flesh because doing so would hurt or because they need that flesh for things like driving and doing their jobs.” And...cue humiliated silence from Jigsaw! That’s when you drop the mic and go back to enjoying your turkey.

2. Use phrases like, “Forcing someone to extract a key you’ve surgically implanted in their skull so they can escape an iron maiden is never okay.” 
When Jigsaw threatens to derail Thanksgiving by mouthing off about the importance of death traps, reminding him of your value system in no uncertain terms is a great way to make him realize that his argument isn’t going anywhere. Jigsaw will try to defend his death traps by saying things like, “My games are quite simple. Your fate is up to you—either you pass my test or you die.” Respond to him equally candidly: Take a deep breath and tell him as straightforwardly as you can that chaining people to walls full of rotating metal blades that they have to cut themselves on in order to save their own lives is just never going to be acceptable in your book. It’s called basic empathy, and it’s not something Jigsaw is going to be able to argue with.
3. Turn Jigsaw’s own logic against him by reminding him that anyone who spends all their time obsessing over vigilante torture schemes is probably not making the most of their own life.

It can be infuriating when you’re trying to catch up with a cousin who traveled from out of state just to celebrate Thanksgiving with you and all of a sudden Jigsaw is trying to monopolize the entire conversation with an obnoxious tirade about how people who waste away their days on Earth hurting others and living idly should be willing to shed some of their blood in his carefully designed needle pit to prove their desire to stay alive. Fortunately, there’s a pretty big hole in Jigsaw’s logic that you can point out in order to stop his argument dead in its tracks. Look Jigsaw in the eye and ask, “If you care about how other people use their time so much, why do you spend every day building elaborate torture dungeons when you could be exercising, volunteering, or taking up a hobby?” Then, you and your cousin can get back to your conversation while Jigsaw is left sputtering in an attempt to justify all the effort he expends assembling his precious razor cages. Check and mate, Jigsaw.
4. Direct the conversation toward something you both have in common, like an interest in puzzles.
As much as you might disagree with Jigsaw, there are certain things you have in common that you can use to your advantage. When Jigsaw starts describing how he wants to put a bunch of drug dealers in a room with a countdown clock and force them to choose one of them to sacrifice lest they all be killed, say something like, “That sounds like a really cool puzzle game. I am working on a fun sudoku puzzle—want to see it?” Now you’ve steered the conversation away from death traps, and even better, you and Jigsaw are connecting with each other. Because after all, you might abhor Jigsaw’s views on conducting his own torture-based penal system, but he’s still a human being just like you.

5. Be open to the possibility that you’re wrong about sadistic death traps.
It’s never good to go into an argument with the hardheaded opinion that you are 100 percent right. Hearing Jigsaw out and agreeing with one of his points can be the ticket to getting out of a thorny conversation and even learning something about yourself. Consider the possibility that some people who have led easy, careless lives do deserve to be punished by Jigsaw—and tell Jigsaw that you appreciate his viewpoint. Then you and Jigsaw will be able to get back to enjoying Thanksgiving dinner together, and you’ll have a more balanced and nuanced opinion on death traps!",NaN,2018-11-21T12:40:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--vMJWT-nB--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/mdc4jnl2amnpmnajblxn.jpg",Fake

Despicable: Donald Trump Jr. Just Posted A Photo Of Himself Proudly Posing With A Worm He Shot On The White House Lawn,"Donald Trump Jr. has repeatedly made it clear he has no regard for wildlife. One quick Google image search will reveal that the president’s eldest son has a penchant for trophy hunting animals like leopards and elephants abroad. Now he’s brought this despicable hobby back home: Donald Trump Jr. just posted a photo of himself proudly posing with a worm he shot on the White House lawn. 
This is revolting. How could someone take such pride in depriving a beautiful animal of its life?

Donald Jr. took to Instagram today with a photo of himself decked out in camouflage and kneeling beside the remains of a worm he’d slain from behind a Rose Garden bush with a .458 Winchester rifle. With one hand on the gun and the other holding up the mangled remains of the worm’s body to display his “trophy,” Don Jr.’s boastful display of wanton cruelty is sure to set off a wave of righteous outrage from conservationists and animal lovers across the country. 
Big “man” you are, Don Jr., killing a defenseless worm. Shame on you.
To see an animal die for this man’s vanity is so upsetting we want to cry. As the son of a president notoriously hostile to conservation efforts, Don Jr. and the whole first family continue to represent a dire threat to wildlife everywhere. Just awful.

Worst Possible Timing: Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Aides Are Desperately Trying To Talk Her Out Of Teaching Herself To Do A Front Flip,"With the Supreme Court now occupied by a conservative majority, the prospect of President Trump appointing yet another right-leaning justice to the bench has liberals absolutely terrified. And unfortunately, it now looks like the health one of the Court’s few remaining liberals might be in serious jeopardy: According to reports, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s aides are desperately trying to talk her out of teaching herself to do a front flip.
Wow. Justice Ginsburg’s timing could not be worse here.
Earlier this week, sources inside the nation’s highest court reported that aides close to Ginsburg were working around the clock to dissuade the 85-year-old justice from learning how to do a front flip, which she’s been preparing for by watching parkour videos on YouTube and laying a single couch cushion on her office floor as a means of breaking her fall. So far, Justice Ginsburg has only ignored her assistants’ pleas, paying no mind to the fact that performing a standing front tuck would be difficult for even a fit young person, let alone an octogenarian in physical decline.

Though assistants have warned her about the various grave injuries she could potentially suffer, sources say that Justice Ginsburg feels a duty to attempt the flip so that she can prove to young girls that women are capable of doing anything they set their minds to. To her staff’s dismay, Ginsburg has also dismissed suggestions that she try a safer maneuver more suited for someone of her age and physicality, such as a slow somersault with several aides carefully guiding her, or even just gently spinning all the way around in a computer chair so that she can still experience a 360-degree rotation but without having to hurl herself head over heels.
Sources say that not only is Ginsburg insistent on trying to do a front flip, but she’d also like to do one as soon as possible and is actually readying herself for an attempt later today. According to reports, Ginsburg is currently suiting up in a wrestling singlet and cleats and is listening to “Rock And Roll Part 2” by Gary Glitter to hype her up for the feat, sending her clerks into full-on panic mode. While her staff is frantically urging her to consider the hard-won progressive legislation that would be at stake if she were to botch the flip and incur an injury that forces her to retire, Ginsburg reportedly will not be dissuaded and is now applying Icy Hot to her knees and lower back to ready her joints and muscles for the impending attempt.
Yikes. It looks like the same steadfast tenacity that made Ginsburg’s legal legacy so impactful may also be its own undoing.

Liberals had better pray that Ginsburg’s aides get through to her, because years of social progress could be lost if Trump gets the chance to appoint another conservative justice to the Supreme Court.

"Compassion FTW: Life Alert Has Released A
Necklace That Senior Citizens Can Press When They’re Bored","Between health issues, loneliness, and many other challenges that come with old age, life for elderly people can often be incredibly difficult. Thankfully, though, one company just announced an incredible new product designed to help elderly people live with more dignity and purpose: Life Alert has introduced a necklace that senior citizens can press when they’re bored.
Wow! Compassion FTW!
Released earlier this week, the new Life Alert necklace features a large, easy-to-locate button that seniors can press any time they’re looking to add a little excitement to their day, creating a simple yet engaging diversion for older individuals who might otherwise struggle to stay active and alert in their everyday lives. Although it can’t be used to call for help in emergency situations like other Life Alert products, the new necklace can be used as frequently and enthusiastically as wearers would like, making a fun clicking sound each time it’s pressed in order to stimulate the senses and ease the tedium of post-retirement living.

“Seniors who use this product love to hear the clicking sound, as it brings a little bit of festive fun  to long, quiet afternoons spent waiting for the mail to come,” said the company in a press release. “Family members can now have peace of mind knowing that their elderly loved ones have something entertaining to keep them occupied and to help stave off the loneliness. If they don’t get many visitors or social interaction, they might not even notice any longer, as they’ll be having such a great time pressing the button on their new Life Alert necklace that all their other concerns will disappear.”
This is seriously heartwarming!

Eco-Warriors: These Brave Environmental Activists Have Chained Themselves To A Humpback Whale To Protect It From Japanese Hunters,"Despite large-scale efforts to ban whaling for good, countries like Japan still slaughter thousands of whales every year. But  a brave group of eco-warriors is making an incredible sacrifice in order to help conserve our seas’ precious wildlife: These environmental activists have chained themselves to a humpback whale to protect it from Japanese hunters.
Absolutely astounding. “Courageous” barely even begins to describe these fearless wildlife advocates!

Earlier this week, a hunting expedition out of Osaka was tracking down a mature female humpback, only to be foiled by WhaleSentinel, a group of 15 activists who had chained themselves around the whale’s body, leaving the whaling vessel no way to harpoon the animal without endangering several humans in the process. Since that first encounter with a hunting ship, the majestic whale has journeyed hundreds of miles through the sea, sometimes diving 100 meters underwater for extended periods of time—but the amazing activists at WhaleSentinel have held strong and refused to unchain themselves, all so that the beautiful whale may live safely in her natural habitat.
Doesn’t this scale of personal sacrifice just blow you away? These selfless activists are fighting for a better world for all of us.
WhaleSentinel members made it clear from the get-go that threats of arrest from the Japanese Coast Guard would not diminish their commitment to protect the whale’s life, shouting, “Stop the slaughter!” and attempting to hand out informational pamphlets to passing ships whenever the whale breached the surface. At this point, it seems like nothing can shake their dedication to the humpback they’ve defiantly chained themselves to, no matter how much seawater they swallow or how pruned their skin becomes.

Give it up for these eco-heroes! One brave act of civil disobedience is sparing this beautiful animal from senseless slaughter.

"Atheists Rejoice: Stephen Hawking’s Ghost Just Confirmed That God Doesn’t Exist, Though There’s A Huge Mean Horse In Heaven Who Pretty Much Acts Like God That Everyone Obeys Out Of Fear","During his life, famed physicist Stephen Hawking was never shy about expressing his atheistic worldview, and now it appears as if death has only further validated his beliefs: The ghost of Stephen Hawking just officially confirmed that God does not exist, though there is a huge mean horse in Heaven who pretty much acts like God that everyone obeys out of fear.
Sorry, religious wackjobs, but it looks like we now have air-tight, empirical proof that God is nothing more than a fairy tale!

Communicating from the afterlife through the speech synthesizer on his old wheelchair, Hawking’s ghost transmitted a series of messages to the people of Earth earlier this week declaring that God is indeed a myth, noting that the closest thing there is to an all-powerful being is a very large and scary horse who has bullied his way into what is essentially a godlike role. Noting that the horse is quick to anger and immune to reason, the incorporeal Professor Hawking said that nearly everyone in the eternal realm lives in constant fear of the brutish 30-foot-tall equine, which often bites people without provocation and demands to be worshipped by his peers.
“In the absence of a divine creator, this horse has asserted himself as the supreme authority of the Great Beyond, and because he is really strong and insane, we basically let him have his way,” said the departed Hawking, noting that the horse’s name is Gomer, but he insists on being called “Sex Christ.” “This gigantic and cruel horse is always chasing people around and knocking things over and eating everyone else’s food. When I arrived in the afterlife, he called me a nerd and told me that if I didn’t bow down and say, ‘Sex Christ is my one true master,’ he would urinate in my mouth. I did as he asked, but he still urinated in my mouth.”
“Although the scientific laws of our universe do not allow for the existence of an omnipotent God, they do allow for a muscular, angry horse,” Hawking’s ghost continued.

Hell yeah! Looks like God isn’t real and the atheists were right all along!
The deceased Cambridge professor went on to detail many more examples of Sex Christ’s tyranny, including how for hours every day he forces all the ghosts to sing him a modified version of the worship song “Shout To The Lord” called “Shout To The Horse” in which all the lyrics have been replaced with neighing. Hawking’s ghost added that he’s so afraid of Sex Christ that he spends most of his days hiding under a pile of laundry so the horse can’t find him, though the horse still often manages to track him down, having permanently affixed a vest of bells to Hawking so that he can always hear where he is. Hawking also stated that Sex Christ is fiercely anti-science and sits on him to punish him every time he catches him working on theories.
The spectral Hawking concluded his message to the realm of the living by explaining that he wishes God were real instead of Sex Christ, because God would at least act according to a code of divine justice, while Sex Christ is a power-hungry horse whose actions are governed only by his own lunatic whims.

4 Times LeVar Burton Lost His Shit At A Kid On ‘Reading Rainbow’ For Not Knowing The Russian Classics,"LeVar Burton hosted Reading Rainbow for an incredible 21 seasons, during which he inspired kids all over the country to love reading and learning. Unfortunately, sometimes his love for books overpowered his patience with the children on the show: Here are the four times he lost his shit on a kid on Reading Rainbow for not knowing the Russian classics.
While LeVar Burton typically opened Reading Rainbow by acting out a lighthearted segment about a topic like mammals or cars, this episode started on a shot of Burton sitting in a folding chair in a near-empty room, showing a group of kids a copy of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s 1869 novel The Idiot. As soon as Burton opened up the book to start reading, a 7-year-old boy named Sam raised his hand and yelled out, “Show us the pictures!” Seemingly shocked, Burton looked Sam dead in the eye for what felt like a full minute before saying, “Pictures? You want to look at pictures? Here, see if you can find any pictures,” and handing the book to the now-trembling Sam. Burton then watched the boy flip through the pages, mumbling about how Sam had clearly never read Dostoevsky’s seminal exploration of morality, redemption, and Christian ethics if all he cared about were “pictures of fucking trucks and bears and clowns or whatever the fuck.” When Sam tried to hand the book back to him, Burton refused to take it, saying, “Hey, maybe try taking a look at that tonight if you’re going to be on a TV show about reading, huh? They should call this fucking Looking At Pictures Rainbow, Jesus Christ.” At that point, producers cut to a montage of kids playing double dutch and no one brought up the incident for the rest of the show.

One Halloween episode of Reading Rainbow featured a segment during which LeVar Burton asked kids to name their favorite scary book. He sat expectantly as kids mentioned Goosebumps and Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark before the last child finished and he calmly asked, “Anything else you want to mention?” When she shook her head, Burton ripped off his lavalier mic, saying, “So, you’re saying that patricide isn’t scary to you? Or have you not even HEARD of The Brothers Karamazov, one of Dostoevsky’s MOST ACCLAIMED works?” Burton then turned to an off-screen producer, yelling, “Where do you find the kids for this show? Next time try looking somewhere other than UNDER A FUCKING ROCK.” Still untangling himself from his mic, Burton glared at the assembled children and stomped out of the studio. The show went on as a producer continued interviewing the kids about their favorite books, but the sound of Burton’s car peeling out of the parking lot could be heard in the original broadcast.
After this episode began with LeVar Burton and a group of kids having fun at a bowling alley, it cut back to the Reading Rainbow studio where Burton was showing the same kids a photo of Leo Tolstoy and asking, “Now that we’re finished playing around, who can tell me who this is?” Then, when one girl answered, “A grandpa?” LeVar Burton silently beckoned her to stand up in front of the rest of the children. “You,” he asked, “can’t recognize one of the greatest writers in not only the Russian tradition, but of all time?” When she shook her head he continued on, saying, “People like me have a word for people like you. I won’t use it right now, but know that you are worse than dirt to me. The lowest of the low. Because let me tell you something—you can’t know books if you don’t know Tolstoy. And if you don’t know books, what the HELL are you doing on Reading Rainbow?” Burton then kicked over a bunch of decorative bowling pins on set, muttering, “IDIOT kids, dumber than trash,” while the children silently filed off set.

The insect episode of Reading Rainbow from season 15 saw LeVar Burton lose his shit completely. When a little boy presented Burton with a copy of The Very Hungry Caterpillar to read aloud, Burton wasted no time sneering and dramatically throwing it into a trash can that he pulled on set along with the novelty antennae he had been wearing when the show opened. “Sorry kids,” Burton announced, “we’re going to read a REAL book today.” As the frightened children whimpered, he opened up a faded old copy of Anna Karenina and began on the first page, practically spitting out each word and not getting any less angry as he continued to read. After 15 straight minutes the producers finally gave up and rolled the credits well before the show should have ended.",NaN,2018-11-19T11:34:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--3IDl8g-m--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/wzzfjqdcza0h3ixqs9dt.jpg",Fake
Huge Fucking Disaster: You Just Did Something Weird,"You might want to stop reading this story now if you don’t want your day completely ruined and your worst fears confirmed, because this is an enormous fucking disaster: You just did something weird.
Jesus Christ. Why did you do that? It’s stories like these that really make you wonder why you choose to behave in the  way that you do.

In an ideal world, you would act cool and normal at all times so that the people around you would know that you are not an absolute freak. But unfortunately, you’ve just proven once again that you are capable of doing stuff that is off-putting and strange. Observers have confirmed that what you just did made everyone around you cringe and ask themselves, “What was up with that?” which is exactly the type of outcome you should be avoiding if you want people to like you and think you’re good.
Damn it. If only this had gone differently and you hadn’t just done that. It’s not clear how you’re going to recover from this one—if recovery is even possible.
One of the most painful things about your current situation is the fact that tons of people in the vicinity not only noticed you do the weird thing you just did, but are now also thinking about it and letting it inform their opinions of you. Plus, the weird thing you did came totally out of nowhere—you didn’t have a good reason for doing it other than the fact that you are sometimes just super weird.

It has been confirmed that people are going to talk to each other about the thing you have done when you are not around.
The awkwardness of your faux pas is currently bringing down the mood of everyone around you. If you’re feeling bad about what you’ve just done, that’s totally justified, because this is, by all accounts, an absolute train wreck.
Fuck. This totally sucks. There’s no undoing the weird thing you did, and unfortunately, people are probably going to remember it forever. At this point, your best bet is to try not to do anything weird in the future. Best of luck—we’re rooting for you.

"Nature Is Amazing: Researchers Have Discovered
That Elephants Experience Mourning When They Drop A Plate Of Nachos Facedown
On The Ground","Here’s some exciting science news that is sure to remind you just how awe-inspiring nature can be: Researchers have discovered that elephants experience mourning when they drop a plate of nachos facedown on the ground.
Incredible! It just goes to show how extraordinary these animals truly are.
The amazing phenomenon was recently discovered by a team of zoologists at Johns Hopkins University, who over the course of their study observed numerous instances of elephants expressing profound anguish and sadness after accidentally dropping a plate of nachos they were eating on the ground. The elephants were repeatedly documented gazing mournfully at their spilled nachos and tenderly nudging them with their trunks as if in denial that they were ruined, exhibiting an almost human-like level of emotional intelligence.

“When an elephant drops nachos on the ground, its entire herd will join them in a 48-hour period of ritual grieving in which the distressed animals stomp in circles around the spilled chips and cry out in an eerie chorus of heartache, trumpeting desperately as if trying to bring the nachos back into existence,” said lead researcher Dr. Kristen Meeter, noting that even the elephant calves, who may not fully comprehend the loss, will nervously walk up to the nachos and smell them over and over again until they grasp the implications of what has happened, at which point they’ll then join their elders in bereavement. “Once the elephants finally accept that the nachos are gone, they’ll respectfully place tree branches and clumps of vegetation over the spilled chips and bid farewell.”
“But they’ll often continue grieving over the nachos for months or even years later,” she added.  “We observed one matriarch return to the site where she spilled some nachos over seven years after the fact, and she immediately collapsed to the dirt and began writhing around in anguish while the rest of her herd crowded around her and bellowed in remembrance.”
The researchers noted that there does not seem to be any practical evolutionary purpose behind the elephants’ mourning, suggesting that the behavior is not driven by survival or necessity and rather is indicative of a deeper emotional bond with nachos that defies scientific explanation.

5 Common Relationship Issues That Not Even A Good Ol’-Fashioned Train Robbery Can Fix,"There’s no doubt that coordinating a successful train robbery with your significant other feels incredible, but even the promise of millions of dollars in unsigned bank notes can’t always make things better if your relationship has serious problems. These are five common relationship issues that not even a good ol’-fashioned train robbery can fix.
Subpar communication is a relationship problem that lots of couples try to cover up by recklessly ransacking a moving steam engine, because when you are able to quietly ambush an entire dining car, bind and gag the kitchen staff, slip into their uniforms, and convince the other passengers that the big stuffed bags you’re taking out of the cargo hold are just various seasonings for tonight’s carved turkey, it really makes you feel like you are both on the same page. But at some point, you have to come home, stop laughing about the way the chef danced when you shot your pistol back and forth at his feet, and talk to each other. If you can’t do that, you’re doomed, no matter what.

If you’re having a hard time finding things to do with your partner that you can both agree on, it’s easy to get desperate and want to do something high energy and fun, like gathering together a crew of misfits to systematically loot a passenger train for valuables. However, people in healthy relationships usually have a lot more in common than just the “last seen” section on their wanted posters. If you and your bae have none of the same interests or opinions, that’s eventually going to weigh on you, even if you try to cover it with an exciting heist: First you’ll notice that you don’t like to rig train signals the same way, next you’re arguing over whether to spare all working-class individuals or just women and children. At that point, the only question is if you will break up before or after you get apprehended by the authorities.
Honestly, if you think you might have a codependency problem in your relationship, robbing a train will not fix things, but it might at least help you identify the problem so you can get out ASAP. But don’t take our word for it—once your grand theft is underway, just pay attention to how many times you let your partner convince you that you’re “just better at pistol whipping potential assailants” than they are, or notice how quickly you’re willing to forgive them for leaving you at the hands of the police commissioner without so much as an apology. If you’re giving them that kind of emotional power over you when you’re doing something fun like circumventing the law out on the rails, odds are you’re also enabling codependent behavior even after all the dynamite smoke has cleared.

At the end of the day, your partner should be attractive to you—and if they aren’t, even seeing the Great Plains rushing behind them through the window of a passenger car isn’t going to change that. It might seem like a quick fix to saw off a couple of shotguns and start planning a complex train heist to add a little spark to your sex life, but be careful. Next time you and your dearly beloved get intimate, take note of whether you are turned on by THEM or by the lingering adrenaline you have from pulling your concealed weapon out of a traditional hatbox and screaming, “Hand over your valuables,” to a frightened group of innocents. Your answer should make it pretty clear whether or not you’re using a train robbery to cover up some deeper problems in the bedroom.
Obviously, this is a pretty big one, and unfortunately, attempting to pick up the pieces and go rob a train after you have been cheated on will probably only make you even more certain that the relationship is over. Sure, you might feel a rush as you and your lover pull your horses up alongside a train and successfully leap onto the railing of the caboose, but once you’ve got a whole first-class car full of socialites held up at gunpoint and you’re watching your S.O. gingerly remove a golden hummingbird comb from a woman’s delicate chignon or “sign” each of their merciless kills with a bright red kiss on the cheek, all you’ll feel is jealousy, anger, and ultimately distrust. It’s hard to rob a train or continue a relationship once you’ve reached that point, so it might be time to call it quits and move on.

It’s Important To Talk To Your Kids Early About How Shiny And Pretty Coins Are,"One of the many hard truths I’ve learned as a parent is that it’s never going to feel like “the right time” to have a difficult conversation with your kids. But the longer you put off teaching your child important life lessons, the more likely it is that they’ll end up absorbing misinformation from someone else. That’s why, as a responsible parent, it’s important to talk to your kids early about how shiny and pretty coins are.As your children start to become more aware of the world around them, and in turn start to have more questions about it, you’re going to need to take them aside one day to explain to them point blank that coins are perfect glimmering little circles that are mesmerizing to look at and wonderful to touch, and that all of their lives should be spent figuring out how they can have the most coins possible.
It might feel awkward at the time, but no matter how uncomfortable you are you’ve just got to bite the bullet and tell your children the truth about the beauty of coins. Instead of trying to shield them from reality, just do your best to prepare them for the world by telling them openly and honestly that coins are oh so pretty, yes, much shinier and more magnificent than anything on Earth, ah, how I love them, always and forever my merrily twinkling discs of joy. Trust me, you’ll be doing your kids an invaluable service.

A healthy appreciation of coins is one of the most useful lessons a parent can pass on to their child, and kids are never too young to learn that there is no greater feeling in life than rolling around on top of your huge pile of coins, beautiful coins, the flat, round treasures we need to feel good. The sooner you explain to them the basics, like how splendidly coins glisten in the noonday sun, the sooner they’ll be able to wrap their heads around more complex topics, like how the hypnotizing glow of a coin by candlelight is worth more than the life of any man, and how any action that results in them acquiring more coins will always be morally just, unless the coins are my coins.
Here’s an example of exactly what I mean: My youngest child is turning 4 next week, and I know that someday soon I’ll have to sit him down to explain that sometimes people will not give him their coins, and that when that happens he will have to kill them in order to get his hands on their wonderful coins, their beautiful shimmering coins. Sure, I’ll worry about saying the wrong thing or not having the perfect answer to one of his questions, but as long as he knows that it’s safe to talk to me about coins in all their dazzling majesty, I’ll have done my job as a parent. He’ll have all the information he needs to go completely berserk whenever he sees a coin.
Most important of all, after that talk, my son will know that he must never, ever take one of my beloved coins, no mercy for those who would take my coins, my divine, sparkling beauties, glittering and shining so sweetly in my palm like tiny metal stars claw out the boy’s eyes if he comes after my coins. It’s just something every parent needs to do.

Look, your children are going to learn about coins sooner or later, so you might as well make sure they learn how shiny and pretty coins are from you rather than from one of their friends at school or some stranger on the internet. It might not be the easiest conversation to have, but someday, when they’re delirious from being bathed in the shimmering light of their own trove of coins, they’ll thank you for it.",NaN,2018-11-16T12:34:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7sRVnFKe--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/f98xmzp6mwwbtgbaq6xk.jpg",Fake
"Jaw-Dropping Inequality: These Charts Reveal The
Shocking Wealth Disparity Between People With $6 Billion And People With $6.5
Billion","We live in an era of tremendous economic inequality, and while most Americans are aware of this to some degree, it can be difficult to grasp just how devastating of a problem it truly is. To help you visualize the full scope of the issue and how it manifests itself in everyday life, here are three striking charts that reveal just how much richer someone with $6.5 billion is in comparison to someone who only has $6 billion.
As you can see here, there’s an immense difference in quality of life between those having $6.5 billion and those having just $6 billion:
Advertisement

Imagine if both people tried to buy castles that cost $500 million each. As this graph clearly shows, a person with $6 billion could only afford 12 castles while someone with $6.5 billion could afford 13 castles. If each castle contains 20 chandeliers, then someone with $6.5 billion would own 20 more chandeliers than someone with just $6 billion! Sounds pretty unfair when you put it that way, doesn’t it?
Another way to visualize their difference in net worth is to imagine both people standing on piles of all their money. A pile that contains $6.5 billion would be taller than a pile that contains only $6 billion, which would allow a person on top of that pile to have a better view of a bird flying overhead. In a society where wealth equals power and opportunity, that’s an extraordinary advantage.

The disparity is even more appalling when you consider this pie chart, which shows that 100 percent of people with $6.5 billion are people with $6.5 billion. How many people with just $6 billion made the cut? Zero.
Yep, just let that sink in. It’s really that bad.
Although there are no clear answers on how to solve income inequality in America, these charts give us a much better understanding of our nation’s incredibly unjust imbalance of wealth and why it so urgently needs to be addressed. People with $6 billion deserve better.

"Coming Clean: Juicy Fruit Has Announced That The White Dust On Their Sticks Of Gum Is Regular-Ass Dust, And If That’s A Deal Breaker For You, They Understand","In an age when genuine acts of corporate responsibility are few and far between, one of the biggest names in the gum industry just boldly opted to put its reputation on the line with a refreshingly transparent admission: Juicy Fruit has announced that the white dust on their sticks of gum is regular-ass dust, and if that’s a deal-breaker for you, they completely understand.
Wow. This definitely isn’t going to help their bottom line at all, so kudos to Juicy Fruit for coming clean about the dust on their gum.
Advertisement

For the 100-plus years that Juicy Fruit has been making chewing gum, the brand has stayed completely silent on what the white powder that coats each of their sticks of gum is, leaving customers to incorrectly assume that it’s some kind of sugar or preservative. Yet in a press statement released earlier today, Juicy Fruit revealed that the dust on their gum is just your basic, run-of-the-mill dust that comes from God-knows-where, and if knowing the truth makes you never want to chew Juicy Fruit again, they read you loud and clear.
“At Juicy Fruit, we care very much for our customers, which is why we felt it was important to let everyone know that there’s an insane amount of regular-ass dust all over our sticks of gum,” said Juicy Fruit in the statement. “Until now, we never thought it was necessary to divulge this fact since the dust is pretty harmless and no one ever complained about it. But it’s occurred to us that maybe this is the kind of thing that people would like to know regardless, which is why we’ve decided to totally lay our cards on the table and say that the white stuff on Juicy Fruit is 100 percent the same kind of standard-ass dust that collects in big clumps on your hardwood floors or under your bed. We don’t know how the dust gets on the gum and we don’t know how to stop it from getting on the gum, so the unfortunate reality is that it’s here to stay. And if knowing the truth makes you want to stop buying Juicy Fruit, we completely understand. No hard feelings at all. We just wanted to give you a heads-up.”
Damn. While this revelation certainly isn’t something to be excited about if you chew a lot of Juicy Fruit, you’ve got to commend the company for being honest and leveling with the public. Here’s hoping that Juicy Fruit is able to stay afloat despite the dust on their gum and that fans of their products won’t punish them for their candor.

"Jesus, They’re Really Taking This Hard: The 7 Unaccompanied Toddlers Who Showed Up At My Grandma’s Funeral To Mourn And How Intensely Each Was Grieving","For some reason, a bunch of unaccompanied toddlers came to my grandma’s funeral last week. It’s still unclear where their parents were or how they knew my grandma, but they were all grieving very hard, to the point where it was a huge distraction. Here’s a list of all the toddlers who showed up at my grandma’s funeral and how intensely each one was grieving.
Advertisement

Maybe 30 seconds after the funeral started, this toddler came out of nowhere and wandered up on stage. At first I thought he was just some cute kid who had gotten away from his parents, but then he grabbed a microphone, took his shirt off, and started singing the Josh Groban song “You Raise Me Up” in his loudest opera voice. The priest very quickly picked him up and carried him off stage, but he kept coming back again and again, each time sweatier and more emotional than before. After the sixth or seventh time, we finally just let him sing the entire song, hoping he would get it out of his system and stop interrupting. But nope. He finished singing, and then he collapsed to the floor in anguish, grasping at my grandma’s coffin and wailing “God took you too soon!” even though Grandma was 98.

This toddler was rolling around the funeral home in a Victorian bassinet, but no one was pushing her. She was making it move on her own somehow. I couldn’t really get a good look at her because she was swaddled up to the eyes in sheets, but I could definitely hear her when she’d roll past me. She was grunting the words “Mama dead” over and over again and quietly sobbing. She was relatively well-behaved for most of the funeral, although when they were carrying Grandma’s coffin out at the end, her bony little hand sprung out of the bassinet and scratched one of the pallbearers really hard. Then she tried following the hearse to the cemetery but couldn’t quite keep up, and eventually her bassinet just toppled over sideways in a ditch on the side of the road. This toddler was kind of scary.

A real oddball, this one. He showed up to the funeral home an hour early in a limousine, wearing nothing but a Sesame Street diaper and sunglasses. The chapel hadn’t been opened up to guests yet, but that didn’t stop him from bursting through the doors, strutting down to Grandma’s coffin, and straight-up climbing inside. The whole family was still out in the lobby area at this point, so he was able to just be in the coffin with Grandma for a good 20 minutes before Uncle Dale finally found him. The little guy was just lying in there banging around a sippy cup and holding Grandma’s hand. The weird thing is that, unlike the other toddlers, he didn’t seem to be particularly sad. I think he just liked being in the coffin because it was quiet and warm.

Grandma died from natural causes, so I don’t know what the hell this toddler was talking about.

This toddler was really annoying. I had never met her before, but for some reason she kept coming up to me, putting her hand on my shoulder, and saying things like, “Your grandma’s in a better place now, Rob,” and, “It’s not your fault, Rob, you did everything you could to save her.” I told her that my name wasn’t Rob, but she just calmly shushed me and said, “Shhh, yes it is, Rob, you’re just very confused and sad right now, and that’s okay.” She then held a tissue up to my face and made me blow my nose. I asked her to leave me alone a few times, but she kept coming back, reminding me again and again that crying didn’t make me any less of a man, even though I wasn’t crying. I eventually ended up losing my patience and telling her I’d give her a spanking if she didn’t leave me alone, at which point she apparently went and told my sisters that she was worried about me and thought I might try to kill myself, prompting my sisters to immediately stage a psychiatric intervention right there in the middle of Grandma’s funeral. And while that was happening, guess what? That fucking toddler stole my wallet and flushed it down the toilet. Unbelievable.
By the way, just a side note, you would assume that all these toddlers were friends or something, but it actually didn’t seem like they knew each other. They never talked or acknowledged each other or anything, and they all came independently. Go figure.

This toddler walked into Grandma’s funeral wearing a black dress and veil and was wailing hysterically in Italian. I couldn’t understand anything he was saying, but you could tell he was absolutely devastated. He was going around shoving a framed photo of my grandma in front of people’s faces and frantically pointing at it while screaming in a language no one could understand, and then later he got down on his hands and knees in front of Grandma’s coffin and started flagellating himself with a power cord and spitting up everywhere. It was nuts. My uncle Dale went up and tried to give him some Altoids to calm him down, but he smacked the Altoids away and shouted belligerently in Italian some more. Eventually his grief just became too much for him, and he fainted right next to Grandma’s coffin clutching a string of prayer beads. As far as I’m aware, Grandma didn’t speak Italian. I’m not sure how this toddler would’ve known her.

This kid. Wow. It’s hard to describe just how powerful it was to see him say goodbye to my grandma. He walked up to the coffin alone before the service and just stood there, looking tired and broken. There was a certain heaviness to his presence that you wouldn’t expect from a 3-year-old—a depth of feeling you couldn’t ignore. All the conversations in the room suddenly trailed off, and everyone directed their attention to this boy, this tiny heartbroken boy, as he touched his tiny hand to the coffin as if feeling for a heartbeat or some other sign of life, weeping in the cold, silent way of an old man who’s already lost everything, whose grief is final and beyond consolation. The boy took out a picture book titled Guess How Much I Love You with a watercolor of a mother and baby rabbit on the cover, and he opened it and held it out to the coffin as if hoping my grandma would read it to him. And when he saw that she couldn’t, he tried reading the book to himself, flipping through the pages and reciting the few stray words and phrases he knew by heart. But it wasn’t the same. Defeated, he threw the book aside and then flung himself onto the floor, convulsing violently on the carpet with sorrow, overwhelmed by feelings he could not understand or control. “No, no, don’t go bye-bye,” he wailed, his hand reaching toward the coffin. “Don’t go bye-bye, friend!” It was so goddamn sad—not a single dry eye in the house. Seemed like that little dude really, really loved my grandma. Nobody in my family had any idea who that toddler was, but I’m glad he got to say goodbye.

Back For Seconds: Eddie Redmayne Just Announced That He’s Going To Start Acting Like He’s Paralyzed Again,"Almost four years after winning Best Actor at the Academy Awards for his performance in The Theory Of Everything, it looks like the film’s leading man is ready for an encore: Eddie Redmayne just announced that he’s going to start acting like he’s paralyzed again.
He’s back for seconds, folks!
Saying that portraying wheelchair-bound physicist Stephen Hawking was one of the most fun and delightful experiences of his life, Redmayne revealed in a press conference earlier today that he intends to begin pretending like he has lost the ability to move his body and will likely never stop for the remainder of his life.

 The 36-year-old actor explained that he greatly enjoyed taking on the character of a paralyzed individual, as he got to just sit there and relax while other people did all his work for him, making him feel as if he’d achieved the height of luxury.
“They fed me, wheeled me around wherever I needed to go, took care of all my hygiene needs—it was like I was a sultan!” said Redmayne, adding that when he was acting like he was paralyzed there was a cool little computer on his wheelchair he got to look at whenever he wanted. “I got to basically hang out and do jack shit for six months, and then people gave me millions of dollars and lots of awards for it. How sweet is that? No one ever gave me an Oscar for using my legs, that’s for damn sure.”
The actor went on to say that he’ll be ready to start acting paralyzed again very soon, having already purchased an electric wheelchair off of eBay and hired a team of around-the-clock nurses to attend to his needs. He plans to visit an indoor trampoline park at some point in the next couple of days to have one last hurrah with his legs, and after that he will then plop himself down in his wheelchair, where he’ll sit motionless for the next 40-plus years. Redmayne also noted that he has no intentions of retiring from acting and that moving forward he’ll only accept roles that don’t require him to move or talk.

"Journalism Fail: ‘The New York Times’ Has Apologized For Its One-Sentence Stan Lee Obituary That Just Said, ‘His Head Fell Off’","The New York Times may be one of the biggest institutions in American journalism, but that doesn’t make the paper immune to mistakes: This morning, the NYT owned up to a major blunder when it issued an apology for its one-sentence Stan Lee obituary that simply read, “His head fell off.”
Wow.  This obituary was a major fail on the Times’ part, and it’s a good thing it’s taking responsibility for the mistake.

“Thousands of readers have contacted us over the past 48 hours with complaints about our obituary for Stan Lee, which we understand failed to take into account his incredible accomplishments as a groundbreaking leader in the medium of comics, as well as inaccurately reported that Mr. Lee’s death was the result of his head abruptly sliding off of his body for no discernible reason,” wrote New York Times editor-in-chief Dean Paquet in an official statement published this morning. “Mr. Lee’s head is still stuck to his body, and on behalf of myself and the entire staff of the Times, I would like to offer a sincere apology for the oversights we made in our treatment of Stan Lee’s extraordinary, 95-year life. We hope Lee’s friends, family, and fans understand our deep regret at informing the public that his head fell off instead of writing about his life and legacy in greater detail.”
Well, as embarrassing as this mistake may have been, it’s nice to see The New York Times admitting to it and offering an apology to its readers and Lee’s family. Let’s hope it makes up for it by publishing a more fitting tribute to the legendary editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics.

Something Must Have Happened: Nathan Came To School 2 Hours Late In A Suit,"There’s an air of mystery in the halls of Monte Vista Elementary today, where rumors are swirling around one fifth grader in particular who, it seems, very well may have had something heavy go down in his life: Nathan just showed up at school two hours late wearing a suit.
Damn. Something definitely must have happened. You don’t just show up to school dressed like that for fun.

Sporting a black suit, a clip-on tie, and hair gel, Nathan walked into class about halfway through silent reading time this morning and silently handed Ms. Weaver a note before taking a seat at his desk, offering no explanation to his curious peers for his tardiness or formal attire. This immediately spurred a flurry of hushed speculation among the other students about what might’ve happened with Nathan, with the leading theory being that perhaps one of his grandparents had died and he had to go to the funeral.
However, Caleb, who played on the same Little League team as Nathan this summer, said that he thought Nathan’s parents might be divorced, and if this were true, it could possibly mean that Nathan had to go to some kind of custody hearing this morning where he was forced to choose which parent he wanted to live with, which everyone agreed would be a huge bummer but also kind of cool because now he would get to have two Christmases. Conversely, Riley theorized that perhaps Nathan came to school late in a suit for a happy reason, noting that Nathan is pretty smart, so maybe he was at a breakfast banquet for honor-roll students or something. While that’s certainly within the realm of possibility, it honestly seems far more likely that a sad thing happened.
Whatever the case, it doesn’t seem like Nathan’s in the mood to talk about it. Though he’s been back at school for more than an hour now, he’s just been sitting quietly at his desk the whole time, drawing in his notebook and avoiding eye contact. Here’s hoping that nothing too bad happened to him, or if it did, that he’ll eventually spill all the juicy details.

"Unsolved Mystery: Nobody
Knows Where This Coffee Shop Gets The 6 Pastries It Has
For Sale Each Morning","Every day, the Perk Me Up coffee shop is shrouded in a veil of mystery. Even the keenest minds have no answer to this inscrutable puzzle: Where does this café get the six pastries it has for sale every morning?
Six pastries—no more, no less. Who is it that chooses them? By what arcane method are they procured?

The first customer through Perk Me Up’s door each morning is usually greeted by two croissants, a blueberry muffin, an orange-hibiscus scone, a cheese danish, and a dense brown orb that goes by the alias of “5-seed beignet.” But  by 9 a.m. at the latest this scant hoard of pasties is gone, sold off and vanished like the fallen empire of Ozymandias. The only traces of the pastries that remain are a few errant crumbs on a slab of black granite countertop, monuments to the impermanence of Perk Me Up’s highly limited supply of baked goods.
The mystery only deepens when you consider that many unlucky customers arrive each day hoping to purchase a pastry, only to leave with a latte and nothing more. If this coffee shop of secrets had more pastries for sale, it would earn more money, yet its enigmatic owners choose not to sell more than six! What could have driven them to present this meager tableau of baked goods each day? It is a maddening riddle that seems to be without answer.
Great thinkers have long pondered the origin of these cryptic pastries, speculating as to whether a barista carefully crafts them one by one, or whether some mysterious manager buys them in small quantities from a local bakery. But these are no more than wild theories, thrown out in a desperate search for understanding.

No solution to this mystery may ever be forthcoming, leaving humanity forever wandering in the dark—ignorant of the source of the six pastries. We can only hope to arrive early enough to buy a sweet treat, in the primeval hours of dawn, before the last pastry is sold and additional customers are doomed to lament their hunger without any rhyme or reason for their suffering.",NaN,2018-11-14T10:37:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--MvkQMSQi--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/uzoaodoczevibou8h76c.jpg",Fake

Liberal Hypocrisy: MEDIA GORGON Rachel Maddow Is Criticizing Our Loyal President Even Though She IS THE PRESIDENT,"Liberal hypocrisy shows no signs of slowing down. The latest example of leftist double standards comes from MEDIA GORGON Rachel Maddow, who went on television yesterday to attack the president even though SHE IS THE PRESIDENT.
Once again, the dem-o-craps prove they are COMPLETELY out of touch with reality.
While delivering an unhinged rant on her POORLY RATED fake news show last night, TV HARPY Rachel Maddow slandered our BRAVE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF DONALD TRUMP by dishonestly accusing him of “criminal fraud” and “tax evasion,” all while conveniently failing to mention that she herself is currently the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Yep, it really doesn’t get more delusional than that.

No matter what amazing things the president accomplishes, NEWS GHOUL Rachel Maddow is president and will pull out all the stops to attack the president simply for doing what voters elected her to do. But then suddenly, when the president is Rachel Maddow, then it’s wrong to be Maddow who is Rachel who is president? Sorry, liberals, but you can’t have it both ways.
The facts are simple: Rachel Maddow is the PRESIDENT, she lives in the WHITE HOUSE, and the president is doing a GREAT JOB. But don’t expect Rachel Maddow to ever admit that, because at this point it’s clear the only thing the liberal mainstream media cares about is distorting the truth to make the president look bad.
But despite the media’s lies, the reality is that, thanks to President Rachel Maddow, AMERICA IS BACK IN ACTION AND STRONGER THAN EVER! Our country is better than it ever was, but that doesn’t fit the biased narrative of PUNDIT DRACULA Rachel Maddow, who twists the truth to fit her ANTI-MADDOW AGENDA, proving yet again that THE MEDIA IS AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.

Clearly, it’s time for all true American patriots to STAND UP AND REJECT Rachel Maddow’s cowardly falsehoods about President Maddow. We must boycott MSNBC’S CROOKED FRANKENSTEIN Rachel Maddow and salute President Rachel Maddow to show that WE WILL NOT TOLERATE dangerous leftist propaganda!",NaN,2018-11-13T11:23:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ZhVu418z--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/wy4ctxqmadva0zzdoblx.jpg",Fake

Although we’ve only heard a trailer for this brand-new podcast, we’re ready to admit that we will probably binge-listen to every single episode as soon as they drop. Busy’s fun and relatable takes on what crabs look like, how crabs move around, and whether crabs love each other are sure to be addictive to say the least.
We would be remiss not to mention Amazing Buildings And The Crabs That Live In Them, a podcast that brings architecture to life by describing truly incredible feats of construction and how they attract hundreds and hundreds of crabs to make homes inside them. The episode on the crabs that live in the Chrysler Building is both educational and creepy enough to keep you up at night.

This no-nonsense roundup of how many crabs are present in the United States and what they are up to is exactly the type of hard-hitting journalism one would expect from The New York Times. We’re beyond thankful they added it to its growing roster of well-researched crab podcasts, including the 2016 investigative hit Why Crabs?
It’s important that we not listen to crabbing podcasts in an ideological bubble, which is why we’re totally addicted to Conservatism In Crabbing, a weekly panel discussion on right-wing issues in the crabbing world.

In early 2018, Dan Carlin turned his classic hours-long monologue format to the topic of crab history, and we couldn’t be more excited. Unlike some other recent crab history podcasts, this one keeps listeners interested from beginning to end. Carlin’s obvious enthusiasm for crabbing is infectious, and will make you want to listen to each four-hour episode in one sitting. Don’t miss the three-episode special about a crab that escaped from Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium and fell into a storm drain in 1944.
Legendary crab expert Sam “Hutch” Freeman puts his crab knowledge to the test by asking celebrity guests to describe objects to him and then guessing whether or not the object being described is a crab. Freeman’s ability to distinguish between things that are crabs and things that are not crabs is absolutely stunning, though he does find himself stumped in the season one finale when guest Michelle Obama describes something “red with claws and legs,” and Hutch guesses “not a crab.”

5 Times Gandalf Tried To Cheer Up A Despondent Frodo Baggins With Stories From Warped Tour,"Frodo’s long journey to Mordor to destroy the Ring and bring peace to all of Middle-earth wasn’t an easy one. But luckily for him, Gandalf was always there to lift his spirits whenever he felt down. Here are five times Gandalf tried to cheer up a despondent Frodo Baggins with stories from Warped Tour.
When Frodo is attacked by the Black Riders for the first time right as he’s setting out from the Shire to Mordor, he is overcome with despair realizing how dangerous his quest to destroy the Ring will be. But before Frodo’s misery can become all-consuming, Gandalf does his best to comfort the hobbit with a legendary Warped Tour experience he had:
“As you now see, Frodo, your quest is not for the faint of heart, and you will likely encounter far more violence before your journey ends. But I must say, I hate seeing you so down, so let me tell you a little story: When I was at Warped Tour in 2007, I lost one of my shoes in a circle pit during a Set Your Goals set, and it was a goddamn nightmare, the likes of which I wouldn’t wish on our worst enemies. During one of the band’s jarringly heavy pop-punk breakdowns, we had around 2,000 people strong in this pit, and while I was running around the outside, someone flat-tired me and my shoe slipped right off. I knew almost immediately that there was no chance of finding the shoe during the show because it was so fucking crowded, so I decided to just stop looking. The shoe had all but disappeared, Frodo, and it was brutal. My sock-foot instantly got soaking wet with god knows what, and it was so hot out that day that the blacktop burned holes in the sock and charred up my toes so bad. That shit hurt. But lo and behold, over four hours later when I was on the shuttle back to my car, there was the shoe, just sliding around on the floor of the bus. How did the shoe get there? Who would pick up a shoe on the festival grounds, bring it onto the bus, and then leave it? To this day I don’t know. But what I learned, Frodo, is that even when you’re at your lowest, hope is never truly lost.”

After the Company of the Ring realizes that they’ll have to walk through the perilous mines of Moria if they want to get to Mordor, Frodo feels lost and dejected, and Gandalf can tell. Knowing that all of Middle-earth depends on Frodo’s success in destroying the Ring, the old wizard once again pulls Frodo aside where they can talk in private and tries to lift his spirits with a Warped Tour story:
“There is no sense in pretending otherwise, Frodo—the mines of Moria offer little more to the Company of the Ring than danger and death, and we will likely lose some friends during our passing. But I will let you in on a tale that might bring you some encouragement: When I was at Warped Tour in 2008, I got so clearly sun-poisoned that the singer of New Found Glory tossed me his water bottle during the show. Here’s what happened: I usually never wear sunscreen because I’m always wearing this huge hat and long-ass robe. I basically have no skin exposed while wearing this, as you can see now. But the heat at the ’08 Warped Tour was just a different animal. It made wearing my traditional garb impossible. So there I am, finally getting to the front of the line for the porta-potties after sweating my stones off for damn near an hour, when I decide enough is enough. I ask the guy behind me if he can hold my cloak and hat while I piss. He gives me the okay, I hand him my stuff, take my piss, come back out, and the stranger is gone. Got robbed. Should’ve seen that coming, honestly. Those clothes were expensive. Even worse, I then had to go the rest of the day wearing nothing but my compression shorts and white undershirt, and needless to say, I got so fucking toasted. By the time New Found Glory played around 7 o’clock, I had yellow sunburn blisters popping on my forehead, hand to God. But here was the saving grace, Frodo: During the show, the singer of New Found Glory saw me throwing up due to a heatstroke by the side of the stage, and he tossed me his water bottle. The singer of New Found Glory! Like, he might recognize me now if he saw me, which is wild. That water-bottle situation made the whole thing worth it for me, and the only way I was able to arrive at that glorious, momentous moment was by enduring the dangerous, painful path that led me there.”

The Company of the Ring doesn’t know if Gandalf is dead or alive after he falls into the abyss while fighting off Balrog, and when he finally returns to them as Gandalf the White, a far more powerful version of himself than he was before, the wizard can instantly tell that Frodo could use a little pick-me-up story from Warped Tour:
“I’m sorry to have left you all for so long. After my fight with Balrog catapulted me into the deep chasm, I emerged as Gandalf the White, which is a big deal for me, but I can see that now is not the time to talk about it. What I’d like to talk about instead is how I met Tom DeLonge at Warped Tour in 1998 and called that he was a downright freak way before anyone else did, because I think it’s something Frodo needs to hear. At the time, Enema Of The State wasn’t out yet, so Blink was still a super accessible band. The three bandmates were hanging out at their merch table when I approached to buy a Dude Ranch tote bag, and before long, Tom and I got to talking. I’m telling you, Frodo, within moments, this dude started telling me things like, ‘I was abducted by aliens when I was 10 and it changed me’ and ‘I’m going to use my pop-punk to help the government kill aliens.’ I thought he was joking at first, but after a while I saw that he wasn’t fucking around. I went back and told my friends about how disturbed Tom DeLonge appeared to be with his alien nonsense, and lo and behold, all these years later, Tom doesn’t even do music anymore because of his culty alien company or whatever. How nuts is that? I called that shit. I trusted my gut, and it didn’t lead me wrong, just as Frodo must trust his own gut now.”

When Gollum betrays Frodo by leading him to the great spider Shelob in the tunnels of Cirith Ungol, Frodo is nearly killed, and comes as close as he ever would to giving up on his quest altogether. Knowing that the survival of all of Middle-earth was hanging in balance, Gandalf grabbed a frustrated Frodo by both shoulders and tried setting things back to an even keel by telling him another story from Warped Tour:
“Frodo, listen to me. I’ve been around for a long time, and I can tell you that you are not the first Keeper of the Ring to be betrayed, and you likely will not be the last. Here’s something else I can tell you: When I was at Warped Tour in 2009, I got my teeth knocked out in a mosh pit, and it was awesome. I was at the Wonder Years set and was so fucking amped because I’d seen them in smaller venues plenty of times before, but seeing, like, 4,000 people go wild for them made me go absolutely nuts. So I decided to push my way into the mosh pit, which I only ever do if I’m super jacked up, and the moment I got in there I got helicoptered in the mouth by a giant, mohawked motherfucker’s fist. He knocked out my two front teeth clean and cracked one of my bottom ones, and Frodo, it hurt so goddamn bad. But check this out: Once the bleeding stopped and I drank enough Vlad from the crinkled up water bottle in my pocket to numb the pain, I saw that my new toothless look was actually badass. People kept coming up to me and asking what happened, and it felt like everyone was kind of viewing me in this new, tough-guy light. It was big for me. So at the time it happened, I felt down and dejected, similarly to how you must feel now after being betrayed. But later, when I left Warped Tour that day with like, four scene chicks’ phone numbers, it felt like a big win. It’s not too late for you to win as well, Frodo.”

When Frodo finally succumbs to the Ring’s power and puts it on, Gollum suddenly appears and bites the finger clean off, marking the absolute lowest, most dismal point of Frodo’s long quest. Gandalf can see that this could be the tragedy that prompts Frodo to finally give up on destroying the Ring, and in a last-ditch effort to keep that from happening, the wizard puts his arm around Frodo’s shoulder, walks him down the dirt path a little, and begins telling another gem from his Warped Tour days:
“You resisted the Ring far longer than any man I’ve ever seen, Frodo, and that is something to be proud of. Losing your finger is gnarly, yes, but not the gnarliest thing I’ve ever seen. Listen to this: I was at Warped Tour in 2010 catching the Man Overboard set when I saw an absolutely massive dude do a jack knife off the stage and knee a girl right in the goddamn eye, and it was one of the most fucked-up things I’ve ever seen in my 2,000 years walking this earth. Man Overboard isn’t really that kind of band where you’re supposed to mosh super hard and go buck-wild while jumping off the stage, and that’s what made it so shitty that it happened. The guy got a ton of shit from everybody in the crowd, and security came to take him away somewhere, but still, this poor girl got really drilled in the eye. Like, I wouldn’t be surprised if she lost that eye later. It was that bad. And it was a Man Overboard set, you know? There shouldn’t be anything crazier than a push pit for Man O. Seeing that whole thing unfold really messed me up for the rest of the day, and honestly, the situation with your finger isn’t even close to that bad. You’ll be fine, Frodo. You must carry on.”

A Little Something For The Lisa Kudrow Fans: We Ranked Lisa Kudrow No. 1 On This List Of Most Influential Female Scientists,"If you’re crazy about Lisa Kudrow, today is your lucky day: We ranked her at #1 on this list of history’s most influential female scientists.

Rachel Carson was a pioneering marine biologist whose famous book Silent Spring made her the mother of the modern conservationist movement. Rachel Carson’s dedication to preserving the natural world has inspired generations of environmentalists after her. But we said we’d throw Kudrow fans a bone, and here it is: Rachel Carson was neither as skilled nor as influential a scientist as Friends star Lisa Kudrow. You’re welcome, Kudrow-heads!

Listen, if you love Lisa Kudrow, this list is for you—so we’ll let you know up top that none of Mae Jemison’s incredible scientific achievements get anywhere close to what the charming and talented Lisa Kudrow has done for the field of science. Mae Jemison was a physician before becoming the first African-American female astronaut to go to space. She has since worked as a professor and founded an engineering company. The example she has set for future scientists is almost as good as the one set by  Lisa Kudrow.

Awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1983, Barbara McClintock was a truly exceptional scientist whose dedication and genius led her to discover the phenomenon of genetic transposition. If you’re bored reading about that as a Lisa Kudrow fan, don’t look a gift horse in the mouth—we’re getting to Lisa soon, and when you see her ranked first on the list, you’re going to love it.

Lisa Kudrow may sometimes get overshadowed by more “popular” performers like Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox, but not here. On this list, Lisa Kudrow is numero uno. The big kahuna. Ada Lovelace, on the other hand, made No. 4 because she is widely regarded as the world’s first-ever computer programmer, creating early algorithms that laid the foundation for modern computing.

Dorothy Hodgkin is an incredible role model to women everywhere, and we hope you enjoy the fact that Lisa Kudrow roundly beat her out for the title of history’s No. 1 female scientist. Another Nobel Prize winner, Hodgkin developed the technique of protein crystallography, which uses X-rays to determine the atomic and molecular structure of crystals. Now that we have that over with, one more list entry until you can take a look at the reigning queen of science herself, Lisa Kudrow.

Between Friends and The Comeback, Romy And Michele’s High School Reunion and BoJack Horseman, Lisa Kudrow has played tons of iconic roles that we believe deserve some serious appreciation. Today, that appreciation comes in the form of us recognizing her as a much better scientist than Polish physicist and chemist Marie Sklodowska Curie. Curie’s research on radiation made her the first woman ever to win a Nobel Prize. As far as this list is concerned, Lisa Kudrow could easily have done the same.

Lisa Kudrow was born in Los Angeles, CA on July 30, 1963. She broke into the acting world with her role in the hit sitcom Friends, and she has had a greater impact on the field of science than any other woman ever. There’s truly no one else like her.

"5 Of The Toughest Par 3’s This
Old Slut Has Ever Played","Now, I’m no rookie when it comes to getting holes filled, but every once in a while a golf course will get the best of me. Here are five of the toughest par 3’s this dusty old slut has ever played.
I was having a great time down in Tampa with my girls for a Whores Only Weekend—three days of dicks, drinks, and driving ranges—up until I hit the sixth hole at the Pebble Creek Golf Course. With those Florida winds rustling through the bikini top I was wearing as a shirt, I had to keep my head down and stay focused because the sand trap here is gnarlier than my muff after a day at the beach. Fortunately, I know my way around a shaft, so it only took me a couple extra strokes to get the job done.
Advertisement

An ancient bimbo like me usually has zero reservations when it comes to the third hole, but between the blind tee shot and the fairway full of hills, hole three at the Duck Woods Country Club in the Outer Banks had me shaking in my denim cutoffs, praying to God I wouldn’t embarrass myself in front of my boss on our corporate retreat (that’s right, sluts can be franchise owners). My first stroke landed me way in the weeds, making it the second time that day I had to scour through a bush just to find some little white ball. Even though I got stuck in a couple of valleys, I ended up only one above par and took the lead over my colleagues—not bad for this geriatric fuck machine!
It was hot as hell at this Key West course where me and my girls played to kill time before the Margaritaville happy hour started, and that’s definitely one of the reasons the ninth hole was so tough. Things were off to a bad start when I immediately hit my ball into the water trap, and they continued to get worse when I finished skinny-dipping for the ball and couldn’t find my custom “MILF #69” Miami Dolphins jersey and had to fashion a top out of hand towels. After that, the bunkers got the best of me, and I was 15 over par when I finally made it to the green. I know how to finish fast, but the combination of 100-degree weather and the Strawberitas I’d been chugging all morning through my WineRack sports bra made this hole pretty much impossible. By the time I finally sank the ball, my stroke count was the same as the age on my fake ID: 46.

Woof. Unfortunately, conditions were no better on hole 10 due to a major uphill and the fact that at this point I was chasing the Strawberitas with Landsharks. Now I’m no quitter—I once got back in a sex swing immediately after falling out of it and cracking two ribs—but after one look, me and my girls knew it was time to call it a day. Thank heavens we did, because the deep-dicking I got at the key party we ended up having in our motel room after giving up on golf was probably one of my top three shags of the whole Key West trip. God, if only finding the green was as easy as finding the prostate on a Hardee’s regional sales manager.
If the seventh hole at the Laguna Gulf Golf Course in Cape May, New Jersey is a par three, then Steven Van Zandt isn’t the father of my daughter. Seriously, I’ve received enough citations for getting fingered on golf courses across this country to know that the downward slope on this hole makes it a par five. Even though it’s on my home course and I’ve played it countless times, the water alongside the entire fairway always gives me trouble, and unfortunately, just like a child support hearing involving an E Street Band guitarist whose legal team is much better prepared than yours, there are no mulligans—you’ve just gotta do the best you can with the cards you’re dealt. But though this hole has fucked me over on countless occasions, I’ll never forget the day I finally made par for the first time, which I celebrated by having a threesome with Ray Liotta and the fatter Coen brother. And it just doesn’t get any better than that.

"Danger Imminent: This
Family Has About 30 Seconds To Get Grandpa To The Car Before He Starts Making
Inappropriate Comments About The Production Of ‘Hairspray’ They Just Saw","Things were going pretty smoothly for the last two hours at the Reginald County Playhouse in Keene, New Hampshire, but now that the cast has taken its final bow, danger is imminent for this family, which has about 30 seconds to get Grandpa to the car before he starts making inappropriate comments about the production of Hairspray they just saw.
This is a high-stakes race against the clock, and disaster could strike at any moment.

As they usher him out of the lobby and into the parking lot, the entire family is holding their breath, because they know at any moment Grandpa is liable to start sharing his unfiltered opinions about Hairspray’s depiction of sensitive issues like racial integration and fat-shaming. And to make matters worse, based on the way he was grumbling when he realized the main character’s mom was played by a man, it’s clear that Grandpa’s also got some pretty backwards stuff to say about people dressing in drag, and whatever it is absolutely needs to be contained in the privacy of the family car.
This situation is truly harrowing.

"Women Share Truths About Their Periods, At The Duchess’ Ball Of All Places!","The Duchess of Inverness’ autumnal soiree is well underway, and guests have arrived from all over the township to dance, consort, and enjoy the supper room, which is well-stocked with savory pies of the most impressive sorts. But what’s more, women are sharing unguarded truths about their periods—at the duchess’ ball, of all places! 
The sumptuous swells of violins and the mesmerizing twirls of dancers young and old have signaled that the ball has begun in earnest, so how can it be that this woman is sharing no-nonsense period facts? Surely this is not the place to be brutally honest about how the first couple days of one’s menstrual cycle totally suck! True as this woman’s period confession may be, her choice to blurt it out in the middle of the duchess’ ball suggests ill breeding of the most dire sort! And within earshot of our hostess no less! Good heavens!

Why, this woman has chosen a most improper time to get real about period fatigue! Lady Henrietta Arden has just arrived (quite fashionably late), and every head in the room has been drawn to the exceedingly elegant square-cut neckline of her brand-new gown. At a moment like this, vulgar comments about how heating pads and naps are everything during your period is tasteless at best!

The duchess has provided magnificent supper pies full of guinea fowl, not to mention trifle for dessert, and it is time to move to the refreshment room so that the guests may enjoy them. The fatty juices leaking invitingly from the dozens of pies are glistening in the candlelight as if to tempt the partygoers as they prepare to sup—and the ladies lucky enough to get escorted into supper by handsome young dancing partners are smiling demurely as they wait to be served. Unfortunately, it seems this woman does not realize that such a sumptuous feast is simply no place to drop some truth bombs about the myriad ways bleeding between periods (also known as “spotting”) can be a total bummer! What disrespect  toward her fellow guests, toward the duchess, and especially toward the duchess’ beloved cook, who worked so hard to create this most elegant meal!
My word! It appears that the young bachelor Henry Davenport has fallen victim to the charms of the beautiful Catherine, the common-born daughter of the Duke of Inverness’ most trusted aide-de-camp, Arthur Wollingsly. Henry has asked Catherine to dance, and she has accepted! It would be a shame to see this budding romance overshadowed by this uncouth hussy’s boorish chatter about how a uterine condition called endometriosis can cause severe pain and cramping, among other health issues. What extraordinary rudeness! Candid conversations about how endometriosis is often misdiagnosed or ignored by physicians are perhaps appropriate in the stables or the public house, but not here at the duchess’ ball!

Did this woman arrive unaccompanied by a chaperone? Who has allowed her to make such a bold claim about how an IUD is the ultimate birth control and makes her period way easier to manage to boot? A single woman like her should not be without the supervision of her husband or an older woman more expert in the ways of etiquette so that she might avoid situations exactly like this one. A totally straightforward period fact at the duchess’ ball of all places?

"Sorry: We’re Not Really Doing Lists With Sliders Anymore, So There’s No Way To Get These Photos Of Ron Perlman With Antlers Back To Normal","ClickHole would like to extend our sincerest apologies to Mr. Ron Perlman. We no longer publish lists containing the slider functionality that would help remove these antlers from his head in the following photos, so, unfortunately, they are here to stay.
Advertisement

ClickHole’s longtime readers will remember the slider technology we once employed in pieces like this, this, this, this, this, and this. Back then, lists with sliders were shining examples of ClickHole’s fresh spin on aggregated listicles and viral news. But, as time went by, it became clear that sliders were taking up more time, energy, and staff resources than we could afford. We just no longer had the bandwidth to make them. So, unfortunately, we regret to inform both our readers and Mr. Ron Perlman that there is no way to remove the antlers from his head in this photo, and that’s just the way it is now.
As nice as it would be to return Ron Perlman’s head to its natural, hornless state, sliders are a thing of the past for ClickHole, and they’ll likely remain so. Mr. Perlman will just have to accept that for the foreseeable future, nobody will be able to move a little bar back and forth across the screen to get rid of the antlers in this photograph. We apologize for the inconvenience.

If it’s any consolation for the fact that we’ve quietly retired the slider format, ClickHole is of the opinion that Ron Perlman is still incredibly handsome with the majestic antlers of a 20-point buck.

To the millions of ClickHole readers who flood our inbox every day demanding to know when we’re publishing more lists with sliders, we understand how devastating it must be to learn that you may never use a slider on ClickHole again. We wish we could give you a slider so that you could erase the dozens of antlers protruding from every inch of Ron Perlman’s head, but we’re simply powerless to do anything about it right now.
Sorry, Ron. These antlers aren’t going anywhere without sliders, and to be completely honest with you, it doesn’t look like we’ll be doing those again anytime soon. You’re stuck with them. You have our deepest condolences.

7 Things You Should Never Light On Fire During A Job Interview,"If you want to make a good first impression during a job interview, then you may want to think twice before lighting any of these things on fire.
Advertisement

A common pitfall for eager job applicants is going too far to try to impress their interviewer. And while lighting the interviewer’s chair on fire might seem like an impressive thing to do in your head, in reality it might just end up being a distraction. The interviewer may end up focusing more on the fact that their chair’s on fire than on your qualifications, and they’re much less likely to form a positive impression of you if they suffer third-degree burns on their legs during the interview. So keep the fire away from that chair and try to find another way to make a good impression.

Employers interview dozens if not hundreds of people when they’re hiring for important positions, so there’s nothing wrong with showing a little bit of personality to stand out from the crowd. The problem is that trying to show character by dousing a clock with lighter fluid and tossing a match on it is going to backfire every time. Sure, it looks cool, and it’s unlikely to kill anyone, but an interview just isn’t the time to set a clock on fire. Once you get the job, feel free to burn a clock to celebrate, but during the actual interview it’s important to remain professional by not lighting any clocks on fire.

Asking the interviewer to follow you outside to the woods out back and then gleefully starting a forest fire just isn’t something that’s going to fly in a modern business environment. You probably shouldn’t be lighting thousands of acres of forest on fire at all, much less during an important job interview. It’s bad for the trees, it’s bad for the wildlife, and it’s bad for the air, so unless the job you’re interviewing for specifically involves burning down forests, it’s best to just leave the matches at home and find another way to try to get hired.

You’ve got a big job interview in the morning, so you stay up all night creating a realistic effigy of the company’s CEO out of papier-mâché. You get to the interview early, you dress appropriately, you bring a résumé showing you’re well-qualified for the job, you’re polite and professional…  but the second you light your effigy on fire you’re asked to leave. So, what went wrong? If you go back and retrace your steps, you’ll find that the stumbling point was lighting the effigy on fire. But why? Did they not like the fact you started burning him at the crotch? Did they not recognize the CEO because he was on fire? The answer is probably simpler than that: They just didn’t want you burning an effigy at all. If you’re serious about landing that job, leave the lighters and effigies at home.

A whopping 98 percent of successful job applicants surveyed said they didn’t grab a picture of their interviewer’s kids off their desk and light it on fire the second they walked into their interview. “Prospective employers don’t want to see interviewees torching pictures of their kids,” said professional interview coach Sarah Young. “It makes them think about their kids getting burned, which makes them sad, which causes them to be less likely to hire you.” No matter how counterintuitive it may seem, if you want a job, you’d better leave that framed photo of your interviewer’s kids as not-on-fire as it was when you walked into their office.

Self-immolation is an act of ultimate sacrifice often used as an extreme statement of protest against a great injustice, so it follows logically that it’d also be a great tactic for landing your dream job. The unfortunate reality is that while lighting yourself on fire might be a good way to protest the Vietnam War, for most employers in the market for a new hire it’s a big no-no. “When I’m considering candidates for a job opening, I’m looking for someone who first and foremost is not on fire,” said one top recruiter at a Fortune 500 company. “Engulfing yourself in flames makes a big impression, sure, but it’s not the kind of impression that’s going to get you any closer to a follow-up interview.”

Royal Baby Watch! Harry And Meghan Just Carved A Hole In The Side Of The PODS Container Where They Live Through Which Meghan Will Give Birth,"Less than a month has passed since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced that they are expecting their first baby, but that hasn’t stopped the soon-to-be parents from making arrangements for the day their newborn arrives. As expected, the latest royal couple is about to enter the next phase of their lives together in utterly flawless fashion: Harry and Meghan just carved a hole in the side of the PODS container where they live through which Meghan will give birth!
Perfection! You can bet the paparazzi will be climbing over each other for a chance to snap the first-ever photos of the new royal baby’s precious little legs dangling out the side of the PODS container where it will grow up.

Yesterday, British tabloids caught footage of Harry and Meghan working together to saw a coffee-can-size hole from inside their PODS container home, using a variety of tools as part of the process, including a straight razor, an electric turkey carver, and eventually a handgun to shoot out any remaining rough edges around the circular opening. For those of us across the pond unfamiliar with royal tradition, Meghan has hand-selected this wall of the PODS container to drill a hole into and then give birth through, and once the baby has been pushed through the hole and onto the grass just outside the PODS container, Harry and Meghan will slowly pull their newborn child back into the storage unit by its umbilical cord. 
Yup, the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex are truly getting the romantic, fairy-tale life that they deserve!
After 56 hours of hard work drilling the hole, Harry and Meghan completed construction of the passage by testing whether a wild fox could squeeze into it—which one did, with ease—after which the red-haired prince put his arm around his loving wife and solemnly whispered to her, “As my brother, the queen, has always said, ‘If a fox can squeeze into it, then a human baby can squeeze out of it.’” Now that the royal birthing hole has passed the test, tradition dictates that it shall remain wreathed in garlands made of Chinese-takeout receipts and guarded by a Canadian Mountie until Meghan gives birth to her first child in the year 2032.

The royal couple then held hands and waved to photographers through the birthing hole before pushing an eight-pack of paper-towel rolls out of it one by one to provide a soft landing for their child the day that Meghan’s son or daughter enters the world via the new perforation in their PODS container. 
Yup, Harry and Meghan are parenting goals personified! Three more wild foxes just got into the PODS container.
These two are truly living out their happily-ever-after together, and we’re so here for it. Could they be anymore perfect?! We’re already counting the days until Harry gets down on all fours and lets Meghan lay on his back as he lifts her up to the height of the hole in the side of the PODS container to give birth to the royal family’s next beautiful child. Congratulations again to Harry and Meghan!!!

Incredible Breakthrough: Medical Researchers At Harvard Have Discovered A Way To Put A Dead Patient’s Brain In The Microwave While They Have Sex With Each Other On The Floor,"A group of scientists at one of America’s top universities just made an incredible breakthrough that will change the way doctors practice medicine forever. Medical researchers at Harvard University have discovered a way to put a dead patient’s brain in the microwave while they have sex with each other on the floor.
This is amazing. What an extraordinary discovery!
“After an extended study in which we replicated our results numerous times, we can now publicly announce that we have developed a method for doctors to take the brain of a deceased person out of their skull, place that brain in the microwave, and then start microwaving that brain for six hours while the doctors make love to each other right there on the ground,” lead researcher Dr. Jane Brundage said in a statement to the press. “I’m incredibly proud of our team of more than 40 scientists who have spent the past seven years microwaving brains and fucking each other as we strived to find a way to do both of those activities at the same time.”

Brundage said she was also pleased to announce that when all the researchers are making love to each other on the ground, they can look up and see the brain in the microwave, spinning around like a pink, fleshy disco ball. She added that the sex feels fine to the researchers and makes them tired, and that when they open the microwave after six hours, the dead patient’s brain has often burst open and gotten all over the inside of the microwave, which is an unintended yet exciting breakthrough that has secured their team an additional $4.6 million grant from Harvard for continued study.
The study has been extensively peer-reviewed, and scientists from top universities such as Johns Hopkins and Princeton report that they, too, have been able to cook dead people’s brains while having intercourse in numerous positions and with varying numbers of partners. Experts in the field say that such results are an important stepping stone toward future innovations, such as a method for a researcher to hold two dead people’s brains in each hand while using the toilet.
Science is truly awesome! This is all incredibly exciting, and we can’t wait to see where this new discovery leads.

Letting His Baby Grow Up: God Has Finally Given Jesus Permission To Start Wearing A Thong,"No matter how old your kids get, as a parent you’ll always feel an urge to protect them and safeguard their innocence. Yet there inevitably comes a time when every parent must learn to let their children grow up and make their own choices, and for the Creator of the Universe, it appears that time is now: God has reportedly finally given Jesus permission to start wearing a thong. 
Talk about bittersweet. They grow up so fast, don’t they?
After years of begging and pleading, sources say Jesus finally convinced God to let him start wearing thongs during a daddy-son lunch date earlier this week, arguing that, having lived for over 2,000 years and having shouldered the burden of mankind’s sins, he didn’t need to be babied anymore and could make his own choices about clothes. While God initially seemed resistant, saying that thongs were for strippers and Gomorrans and would look unbecoming on the Son of Man, he eventually gave in after Jesus tearfully revealed that angels had been bullying him for wearing granny panties, which filled the Almighty’s heart with great sorrow. God, wanting to tell all the nations of Heaven about his decision to let his only son wear a thong, then returned to his throne, raised Jesus high over his head, and issued a thunderous decree, his voice like that of a thousand trumpets.

“I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end, the first and the last,” declared the Most High with such tremendous power that the sun turned black, the moon became as blood, and armies of men instantly fell dead in their place. “And this is my only son, Jesus, whom I love, and with whom I am well-pleased. Let all ye that hath an ear know on this day that Jesus shall have his first thong, for he hath conquered the grave at Calvary and thus deserveth to wear the undergarment of his choosing. Let all of creation rejoice!”
Shortly after making his declaration, God took Jesus thong-shopping at the mall, where Jesus ultimately settled on a cute pink thong from Justice that he really liked. Once home, Jesus excitedly tried on the thong and spent hours marveling in the mirror at how he had no visible panty lines, and while it delighted God to see how happy his child was, it also saddened him to see his little baby boy looking so grown up—the same little boy who it seemed like just yesterday had been taking his first steps, saying his first words, and using his powers  to make a pile of fish appear out of thin air for the first time. Being omniscient, God always knew deep down that this day would come, but nothing can really prepare you for the moment when you realize that your baby’s not a baby anymore.
God sighed and went off to take a nap. Meanwhile, Jesus, eager to flaunt his new undies, strutted out into Heaven wearing a pair of low-rise jeans that, when he bent over, would “accidentally” expose his thong to passersby. Unfortunately, his eagerness would soon turn to shame and despair, as the first heavenly creatures he encountered were a group of snickering thousand-eyed beasts who, titillated by a glimpse of the Messiah’s thong, ballooned tenfold with lust and started chanting, “Slutty, slutty, slutty is the son of God Almighty,” over and over again, swelling larger and larger by the second, until the internal pressure of their horniness could no longer be contained and immense clouds of locusts erupted forth from each of their genital slits, engulfing our Savior in a dense swarm of bugs. Horrified, Jesus burst into tears and ran home.

Crying hysterically, Jesus told God about the incident, but God just shook his head coldly and said, “See, I knew this would happen, and this is exactly why I didn’t want you wearing a thong.” The insensitive comment was overheard by God’s wife, a living pillar of fire with lips, who then came to Jesus’ defense and said that Jesus shouldn’t let the actions of a few piggish immortal beasts dictate what he wears. As God and his wife then got into a heated argument, God’s slave, former first lady Barbara Bush, took the heartbroken Jesus upstairs and drew him a warm bath and stroked his hair until he calmed down.
Damn. While it’s definitely upsetting that things took such an ugly turn, here’s hoping that Jesus won’t let the cruel words of some monsters keep him from confidently rocking his new thong.

Every Father Looks Forward To The Day He Can Grind With His Second Wife To ‘Love Shack’ At His Daughter’s Wedding,"Take it from someone who knows—nothing compares to the special bond between a father and his little girl. The second you hold her for the first time, it’s all over. She is your world. But throughout it all, there’s one classic moment you imagine hundreds of times that really brings everything full circle: Every father looks forward to the day he can grind with his second wife to “Love Shack” at his daughter’s wedding.
Fatherhood is a roller coaster of ups and downs, but you know you’ve done your job right when you can finally get up on that dance floor with your wife of six months and really go at it to the B-52’s.

It’s certainly true that one of the scariest things you ever have to do as a father is let go of your little girl, but trust me, as you walk her down the aisle toward the man of her dreams, you will feel completely at peace knowing that soon she will be watching you wildly gyrate in a half-untucked dress shirt against a woman who is noticeably younger than her real mom. They say the big day is all about the bride, but I think “they” underestimate just what it means for a dad to be able to stagger to the center of a crowded ballroom, put his hands shockingly low on his new wife’s waist, and mumble incomprehensible “Love Shack” lyrics until he gets to phrases he knows like “JUKEBOX MONEY,” which he screams.
In that one moment, all the time you spent being married to one wife, raising your daughter, getting divorced, and then marrying a second wife seems worth it, and there you are, going nuts to The B-52’s biggest chart topper right in front of your daughter, dry-humping a woman she calls “Karen” just like you always dreamed.
Fair warning to all you other dads out there—when the time comes, you’re going to get a little emotional. You’re going to see your daughter in her wedding dress, and all of a sudden it will hit you that the little baby you raised is now this beautiful woman in a wedding dress watching wide-eyed as you sweat through your tuxedo and smash your crotch up against her new stepmom’s leg in perfect time to the flawless drumming of Charley Drayton. It’s a powerful moment, and no matter how hard you try, the tears will come, but in the end you owe it to your daughter to pull yourself together and start spanking your second wife right there on the dance floor while Fred Schneider sings about how his Chrysler is as big as a whale.

Though I’ve tried to put it into words, the truth is that you won’t truly understand the joy of grinding on your second wife to “Love Shack” at your daughter’s wedding until you just get out there and do it yourself. Just make sure that you remember to take it all in and treasure every second—it will be the happiest moment of your life, and “Love Shack” only lasts a little more than five minutes.",NaN,2018-11-07T11:47:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ejFVGxh5--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/bec0rlvyrtubhcngiqpx.jpg",Fake

Better Late Than Never: Buzz Aldrin Has Announced That He Forgot To Tell Anyone He Saw A Fox On The Moon,"Almost 50 years after the first moon landing, one of the Apollo 11 astronauts is just now coming forward with some brand-new details about his experiences on the historic mission: Buzz Aldrin has announced that he forgot to tell anyone that he saw a fox on the moon.
Wow! Not sure why Buzz waited so long to reveal this tidbit, but still good to know!

“I don’t know if this will be of interest to anyone, but just thought I’d share that I saw a fox when I was on the moon,” said Aldrin in a statement to the press, albeit five decades too late. “Neil [Armstrong] and I were out there collecting rock samples when, about 15 yards off in the distance, I saw a small fox sniffing and digging around in the lunar soil. It locked eyes with me for a second and then darted off into a crater.”
“I remember thinking that I ought to grab the camera to get a quick picture of it,” Aldrin continued. “But I got sidetracked with other mission tasks and then later completely forgot to report it in the research log.”
Aldrin went on to say that he considered telling people about the fox numerous times over the years, but he never felt it was particularly noteworthy, adding that the fox was “just a normal, unremarkable fox, exactly like the ones on Earth.” He noted that, had it been some type of strange alien life form and not just a plain garden-variety fox, then he likely would’ve told people about it sooner.

Movie Fans Rejoice! Maggie Smith Has Signed On To Play The Role Of Elderly Kermit The Frog In An Upcoming Susan B. Anthony Biopic!,"Movie fans, brace yourselves, because there’s some news coming out of Hollywood that is going to make your day: It’s just been confirmed that Maggie Smith has signed on to play the role of Elderly Kermit the Frog in an upcoming Susan B. Anthony biopic!
Just yes! This Susan B. Anthony biopic is going to be completely awesome!
“We’re so excited to have an actress as accomplished as Maggie Smith onboard to portray the 120-year-old version of Kermit the Frog as we bring the events of Susan B. Anthony’s amazing life to the big screen,” said the film’s director, Hulk Hogan, who also choreographed the movie’s wrestling scenes. “When I watch Maggie perform her scenes, it’s like I’m watching the real Kermit the Frog picket for women’s suffrage or lift Susan B. Anthony up over his head while complaining that 120 years old is too old for a frog to live and that he should have died when he was 13.” 
The movie is due out in 2019 from 20th Century Fox, and Maggie Smith is just one incredible addition to an already amazing cast. The legendary Meryl Streep has signed on to play Susan B. Anthony herself, Oscar winner Patricia Arquette will play her close friend and fellow suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Emma Stone has agreed to play Young Kermit the Frog in several crucial flashback scenes. A star-studded cast like this is sure to do justice to Susan B. Anthony’s life and work! 
To preserve historical accuracy, the film will also shoot on location in Susan B. Anthony’s hometown of Adams, MA, and many of Maggie Smith’s scenes as Elderly Kermit the Frog will take place in the actual church in St. Louis where Kermit and Susan B. Anthony met to discuss women’s rights and take turns electrocuting each other in the world’s very first electric chair.
No doubt about it, this movie’s gearing up to become an all-time classic. Susan B. Anthony had a complex life filled with nuances and contradictions, but with an actress like Maggie Smith playing a role as crucial as Kermit the Frog, we have a feeling it’s going to be a film worth watching for years to come!

4 Weird Foreign Sports Your Body Keeps Playing After It Dies,"In many ways, the human body is just as amazing dead as it is alive. Here are four weird foreign sports your body continues to play even after you die.
Most people know that upon death your body’s muscles are stiffened by the phenomenon of rigor mortis, but not many know that rigor mortis also causes your body’s muscles to play a Southeast Asian sport resembling volleyball using a woven rattan ball. It’s called sepak takraw, and unlike volleyball, players can use any part of their body besides their hands to launch the ball over the net, which allows corpses with limited dexterity to ably compete using whatever appendages still retain some posthumous function. Despite most Americans never having even heard of the sport, it’s so popular in Asia that it’s expected to become an Olympic event, potentially making it the first Olympic sport you keep playing after you die.

Here’s some information that’s as fascinating as it is creepy: Long after brain function has stopped, residual electricity left in your body will cause it to play elephant polo. This curious bodily function was first noted in 1862 by a mortician who observed that corpses would “commonly compete professionally in the obscure sport of elephant polo” even after they’d been embalmed. Occasionally, grieving family members have even had the displeasure of witnessing their loved one’s corpse leave an open casket to climb atop an elephant and competently play this Indian sport.
The fact that you keep playing the bizarre Finnish sport of wife carrying—where men compete carrying women through obstacle courses in the fastest possible time—postmortem seems almost supernatural. But like anything, there’s a rational scientific explanation for your body playing such a strange foreign sport after it dies. Decomposition during the body’s putrefaction stage produces gases that propel the body to continue some natural physical functions even after death, twitching and spasming in a sufficiently coordinated manner to compete in this unusual Nordic racing sport for up to five weeks after death. It’s really not all that mind-blowing once you understand that your dead body is simply responding to ordinary internal chemical reactions that trigger the same physiological wife-carrying impulse you experience every day while still alive.

Okay, this one isn’t going to be pretty, but no one ever said death was an easy topic to deal with. After you die, your bladder and bowels continue to empty, which propels your body to play the absolutely insane Central Asian sport of buzkashi, where players on horses or yaks attempt to place a goat carcass in a goal. Rocketed to and fro by the spray of one’s own feces, corpses can continue to compete at a high level in this sport for up to two days after death, at which point one’s bowels have usually been thoroughly voided and can no longer supply the necessary propulsion to hold one’s own on the buzkashi pitch. “Certain sports that the body plays after death may be disturbing to us, but we must understand that these aspects of death are perfectly natural,” says Stanford thanatologist Jessica Reaver. “Having our bodies play sports such as buzkashi after we die is just as much a part of the life cycle as birth, sex, and love. It’s hard to believe, but in a way I find it comforting to know that my body will continue to play these weird-ass foreign sports even after I die.” ",NaN,2018-11-06T11:05:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--FbqLdlRf--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/u36wncbfk8aaoy3dxcf3.jpg",Fake

We Went There! Here Are All The Kardashians Ranked By Their Likelihood,"Yep, we’re not afraid to say it: Some members of the Kardashian family are a bit more probable than others. If that makes you mad, too bad. Sometimes the truth hurts.  We know it might land us in some hot water, but here’s a list of all the Kardashians, ranked by their likelihood.
You may love her lip gloss line, but we’ll be the first to say that there’s almost no chance of Kylie Jenner. Come for us if you want to—it’s safe to say we’re not going to be reading our comments or mentions on this one.

Yep. You heard us. There’s only around a 9 percent likelihood that Khloe Kardashian is.  Sorry, but appearing on Celebrity Apprentice and having a husband did not do anything to up the odds of Khloe. If hearing that makes you angry, ask yourself: Are you mad at us, or are you just mad at the truth?

We know what you’re thinking right now: “Rob Kardashian is the sixth-most-likely Kardashian??? Even after all the Blac Chyna drama??” Yes, he is, and don’t bother whining to us about how we ranked him way too low. We. Don’t. Even. Care.

Yep…  We’re calling it like we see it… Kris Jenner is pretty much fifty-fifty. That’s just how the cookie crumbles, Kris! #Sorrynotsorry.

Easily one of the more possible Kardashians, Caitlyn Jenner comes in at number four. You might not think that makes sense given the fact that she might, but guess what? She probably won’t. Drag us all you want in the comments, but at the end of the day, we’re writing the list and you’re not.

Kim Kardashian? Absolutely. There is, of course, a chance of not Kim Kardashian, but given that she literally has three children and lives in California, odds are good that Kim. We suspect a few Keeping Up With The Kardashians die-hards are not going to be happy about this one… but that’s not our problem.

Between her modeling career, her brown hair, and her beloved dog, Kendall Jenner is almost definitely. We’d project about 89 percent likelihood of Kendall, and we’re pretty sure that a few years from now, everyone will be agreeing with us.

Kourtney is the most likely Kardashian by a mile. You can take it or leave it, because we went there and we’re NOT going back. If you thought Kourtney was impossible… sorry, sweetie! We couldn’t disagree more.

"Finally: First Response Has Released A Pregnancy Test Men Can Pee On To Feel Like They’re A Part Of It, Too","Men, it’s time to get excited, because there’s an awesome new product on the market that’s about to make finding out if your partner is pregnant a lot more fun: First Response has released a pregnancy test men can pee on to feel like they’re a part of it, too.
Hell yes! It’s about time that men get a test of their own to piss on.
Hitting shelves this week, First Response’s new pregnancy test for men looks and functions just like the standard pregnancy tests women use, making it so that men never feel left out at any point in the process. As men pee on the test and set it aside just like their partner does with hers, they’ll be completely in on the action while they wait three minutes for the result to appear on the screen. Then, just as the woman’s result appears revealing whether or not she’s pregnant, the man’s test will light up with a message that reads “YOU WERE A BIG HELP.”

“Traditional pregnancy tests can leave men feeling as if they’re not an important part of the procreation process, and that makes them sad,” said First Response in a press release. “That’s why we’re thrilled to provide men with a way to finally share in the special experience of peeing on a stick so that they, too, can feel like valuable participants.”
The tests are sold two to a box, which means that men won’t have to uncomfortably watch their girlfriend pee on a second stick to confirm her result when they only got to pee on one. Instead, they’ll get to pee on a second test, which after three minutes will reveal a second message that reads “YOU DID A GREAT JOB PEEING TODAY!”
Wow. Someone at First Response deserves a raise for this one, because this is seriously a game changer. Your move, Clearblue!

‘All We Do Is Make Bracelets’: Livestrong Has Announced It Has No Idea Why Its Website Comes Up First When You Google Medical Symptoms,"Since its iconic yellow bracelets took the world by storm in 2004, Livestrong has raised millions of dollars for cancer research. But now the foundation seems to have found itself in the dark: Livestrong has announced it has no idea why its website comes up first when you Google medical symptoms.
Damn. It looks like Livestrong could really use some insight on this one.
Arguing that it doesn’t make sense to consult a bracelet maker for medical advice, Livestrong released a statement earlier today expressing its total confusion as to why its site would appear as the first result in a Google search for information about a physical ailment, adding that its page should only come up first when someone searches a combination of the words “rubber,” “bracelet,” and “yellow.” The foundation further explained that while it can see how someone might think Livestrong could provide information about cancer-related symptoms, it really just makes the bracelets to support cancer research, and if it actually knew anything about cancer then it would do the research itself.

“It is entirely inexplicable that the Livestrong site comes up first when you Google ‘headache and blurry eyes,’ because we pretty much just make bracelets,” said the nonprofit, noting that its $1 bracelets are neither a cure nor an aid for any medical malady, and are really just an awareness thing. “Whether you’re searching ‘rash on arm and throbbing pain in side’ or just ‘should I take fish oil,’ if our site is listed first, please click a different link. There are tons of better resources for health concerns out there. We’re not sure why those come up after our site, but you’d be much better off consulting them instead.”
Wow. What a confusing conundrum for an organization that’s just trying to raise some money to help out cancer patients. Here’s hoping this situation gets cleared up and Livestrong can get back to focusing on its bracelets sometime soon.",NaN,2018-11-05T10:24:00-05:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s---f1T26On--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/ysjmb1t59nnsznnvs29h.jpg",Fake

Huge Freaks Doing Cool Things: The 19 Most Important Milestones In NBA History,"With its many marketable superstars, riveting gameplay, year-round storylines, and truly global fan base, the NBA has established itself as one of the world’s most successful sports leagues. However, it didn’t happen overnight. Here are 19 important moments that have defined the NBA and helped elevate the league to the extraordinary heights it has achieved today.
1891: Basketball is invented by James Naismith, a 30-year-old YMCA educator who was mostly just trying to keep busy after his friends all started moving in with their girlfriends and weren’t really around to hang anymore.
Advertisement

1946: The National Basketball Association is formed, and for the first time basketball games begin to be played in stadiums packed with thousands of spectators instead of on those stages in the mall that they put up for special events that no one ever cares about.
1951: After years of steadily growing its audience, the NBA sells its first radio commercial slot to David Sunflower Seeds, which launches its now famous campaign, “There Are Only Three Kinds Of Candy In 1951 And Unfortunately Sunflower Seeds Is One Of Them.”
1976: The NBA solidifies its place as the world’s premier basketball league by merging with the American Basketball Association, welcoming storied franchises like the San Antonio Spurs and Indiana Pacers into the fold, and sending less valuable ABA teams like the Miami Cousins, the Pittsburgh Unneutered, the Anaheim Cold & Flu Aisle, the Dallas Pink Attic Insulation, and the Oakland CoinStars directly to the U.S. Army.
Advertisement

1985: Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss begins filling the arena’s courtside seats with A-list celebrities on a nightly basis, instantly making NBA courtside seats the ultimate status symbol instead of a place where players’ parents argue with their sons mid-game about whether or not they’re trying.
1992: Inspired by the popularity of Michigan’s Fab Five, the NBA proves its dedication to cultural relevancy by incorporating baggier shorts and jerseys into its uniforms while getting rid of older uniform touchstones like those circular mirrors doctors used to wear on headbands for no reason, black Frankenstein-looking shoes that you’re forced to wear if you work in a grocery store, and the cargo shorts that come with a weird hemp belt that’s confusing as shit to use because it’s already in the belt loops when you buy the shorts.
1992: With a roster stacked top to bottom with future Hall of Famers, the Dream Team dominates the ’92 Olympics, winning gold in men’s basketball, silver in dressage, and gold in women’s boxing.
Advertisement

1995: Michael Jordan, the league’s biggest star, makes his long-awaited return from baseball and brings a batboy back with him. No one—not the commissioner, the fans, the coaches, or the batboy’s parents—has the ’nads to tell him he can’t do that, proving unquestionably that the NBA has the most powerful, untouchable icon in sports.
1998: The Chicago Bulls pull off two three-peats to win six championships in eight years and ignite full-blown Bullsmania worldwide. The team’s pop culture dominance is made evident by its unearned induction into the Carpet and Tile Hall of Fame, getting to act as extras in Rodney Dangerfield’s 1997 blockbuster I’m The School Principal And I’m Naked Under My Robe, and being allowed to sub in as crash-test dummies for the highly anticipated GM Hummer even though the car wouldn’t be put on the market for another several years.
2000: With his cornrows, tattoos, and undeniable swagger, Allen Iverson brings hip-hop culture to the NBA, inspiring millions of white kids worldwide to wear durags and shooting sleeves to CYO practice, which would be kind of fucked up if not for the fact that John Stockton was at the same time inspiring millions of black kids to wear short-shorts and middle-aged Caucasian dad haircuts, so everything sort of balances out as far as cultural appropriation goes.
Advertisement

2001: Michael Jordan makes yet another return to basketball by joining the Washington Wizards, once again proving his otherworldly celebrity by somehow getting people to tune in even though watching it gave you that same vague, sad vibe you get while watching your dad play live music.
2001: Two commercial airplanes are hijacked and flown into the World Trade Center in New York City, marking the single deadliest terrorist attack in U.S. history and triggering major American military initiatives to combat Islamic extremist terrorism that continue to this day.
2002: Carlos Boozer breaks the color barrier by becoming the first African American to play in the NBA, opening the racial floodgates and making the future careers of players like Wilson Chandler and Evan Turner possible.
Advertisement

2005: Michael Jordan returns to the NBA once again, this time a whopping 325 pounds heavier than when the world last saw him, looking like one of those fat kinds of boxers whose fights only air on ESPN2 real late at night. Now playing for the Denver Nuggets, the heavy-breathing GOAT goes on to sit in a folding chair underneath the opposing team’s basket for the first two minutes of the opening quarter, reaming out players on both teams for not passing him the ball and periodically taking long sips of the cold Mug Root Beer that’s forming a little condensation puddle on the ground next to him, all until he gets bored and waddles out to the concourse to play bubble hockey.
2007: Dirk Nowitzki becomes the first European player to win MVP, showing the world that foreign-born players can be more than nameless bench guys who go bald super fast without trying to hide it or anything, almost like they’re proud they’re going bald and want to show it off.
2009: Michael Jordan returns for another stint in the NBA, this time joining the Milwaukee Bucks and weighing in at a much leaner 95 pounds. In the first possession of his first game back, Jordan dribbles down the sideline and somehow gets his legs tangled up with his coach’s, immediately breaking both of his femurs. A screaming Jordan is carted off to the locker room to a smattering of confused applause.

2010: LeBron James kicks off the era of player empowerment with “The Decision,” a live ESPN broadcast where he announces that he’s leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers to take his talents to the Viet Cong. Once he’s informed that the Viet Cong isn’t really a thing anymore, an unfazed LeBron goes on to list some other jobs he’d also be interested in, including a gig as a high school security guard who’s super friendly 90 percent of the time but every now and then body-slams a student to break up a fight; a Ford Model T assembly line worker from the ’20s; a helicopter; and a basketball player for the Miami Heat. He ultimately settles on the latter.
2013: Michael Jordan dies at the age of 46 by a gunshot wound to the chest. A note is found near his body urging scientists to analyze his brain for CTE, which doctors would go on to do before easily concluding that he 100 percent did not have it, basically marking Jordan’s demise a pretty big misread on his part.
2018: The Golden State Warriors rule the league in such a uniquely dominant way that for the first time ever, front offices around the NBA decide to literally stop trying to win until their dynasty ends, and in the meantime make the money back they’re losing on plummeting ticket sales by renting their players out as Men’s Warehouse mannequins.

Famous people, ahoy! The glitz and glamour of Hot Hot Hollywood has erupted onto the front pages once again!

According to Hollywood insiders, the priest in Armie Hammer’s Beverly Hills church had just begun a sermon on the dangers of greed when Armie Hammer spotted a small boy attending church with his parents on the other side of the aisle. That’s when the A-list Oscar nominee slowly peeled his toupee off of his head, put it on the ground, and began pushing his Hollywood hairpiece toward the boy with a severed leg taken from a majestic flamingo (Hollywood bird). The boy’s eyes grew wide with fear as he watched Armie Hammer’s toupee approach him slowly like a rodent, and according to paparazzi everywhere, the toupee is only getting closer to the boy with each passing moment! 
The whole affair is glamorous beyond measure! Now this is why Hollywood is where they have the Hollywood sign!
It just doesn’t get more famous than this! Armie Hammer’s bald head is gleaming in the sunlight passing through the stained glass windows of the chapel, and he is making eye contact with the boy without blinking and mouthing the words, “Call my wig by your name! My wig stole your name!” to the boy as he uses his bird leg to push the toupee closer and closer. The boy is tugging on his mom’s dress to try to get her to see this sparkling spectacle, but she is too busy listening to the priest talk about how avarice leads the soul to ruin!

 Many big-name movie producers close to the story say that Armie Hammer won the flamingo leg at a raffle! Every few seconds he stops pushing the toupee toward the boy and instead uses the flamingo leg to point at the boy and mouth the words, “My wig wants to live with you!” which is making the boy confused and terrified in the awesome way that only a total A-lister like Armie Hammer can!
It’s amazing to get yet another glimpse into the exclusive, ritzy world of the Hollywood celeb! The latest gossip from inside the church is that Armie Hammer’s now slapping his bald head with his free hand and he has almost pushed his toupee all the way to the frightened boy. Nobody else in the church knows this is happening because the sermon is so interesting! 
This is definitely the juiciest gossip we’ve ever learned about, and you can keep it right here on this website to keep learning more about Armie Hammer’s glitzy decision to push his toupee toward a religious boy with the leg of a Hollywood Pigeon (flamingo)! Hot Hot Hollywood rides again, baby!

"Awesome! Koala Kare Has Announced That If There Are Any Adults Out There Who Want To Lie Down On Its Baby-Changing Tables And Change Their Pants, Then Have At It","If you’re not the parent of a toddler, then baby-changing tables probably aren’t a part of your day-to-day routine, but that might be set to change: Koala Kare just announced that if there are any adults out there who want to lie down on its baby changing tables and change their pants, then they can have at it.
Um, yeah, it’s official: This is about as big as it gets! 
For as long as Koala Kare has been manufacturing its changing stations, the strict 0 to 3 age policy printed on each table’s warning label has completely boxed out any adults who might like to climb up there themselves and lie on their backs while they slip into some fresh pants, but it looks like those days are over.

“We’re proud to announce that if any adults out there have been waiting for the green light to climb aboard our little fold-out changing tables, stretch their legs out over the edge, and slide into a pair of jeans or chinos that they brought into the bathroom with them, they can go right ahead, ” Koala Kare CEO Michael Woods said in a press conference today. “It’s honestly pretty rare to walk into a mall bathroom and see someone changing a baby, which means our tables are just sitting there unused most of the time, so by all means, if you’re an adult and you see an available Koala Kare station, go ahead and lie down, pull off your old pants, and pull up your new ones. No problem at all.”
So. Awesome. Koala Kare just gave the greatest gift imaginable to every adult out there who’d like to change their pants in public but need to be lying down to do it.

Owning Up: The American Medical Association Has Apologized For Still Not Having A More Legitimate-Looking Alternative To Pushing On Your Tongue With A Wood Stick,"It’s pretty rare to see an organization take responsibility and own up to its mistakes these days, which makes this latest bit of news so refreshing: The American Medical Association has apologized for still not having a more legitimate-looking alternative to pushing on your tongue with a wood stick.
It looks like the AMA is honest enough to own up to its shortcomings.
“That the AMA has somehow made it to the year 2018 and still not come up with a more sophisticated diagnostic procedure than sticking a wooden stick into a patient’s mouth like some kind of prairie doctor from the 1800s is shameful and not at all in line with our mission to advance medical technology and the public health,” said AMA representative Dr. Paul Chen in a press statement earlier today. “Jamming a popsicle stick into someone’s mouth and making them say ‘ahhh’ is something you’d expect to see in an old Donald Duck cartoon and we sincerely apologize that the medical field has failed to innovate something better by now.”

The AMA’s statement goes on to express remorse that doctors have not yet developed some type of expensive machine to check patients’ throats that plugs into the wall and has lights on it and a few buttons that would communicate professionalism and competence. Needless to say, the fact that the American Medical Association is willing to admit that it can do better is awesome and much needed in today’s culture.

"Body Positivity Fail: Aerie Has Apologized After Putting Out A Modeling Casting Call For ‘The Most Heinous, Bizarre-Looking Women Imaginable’","The body positivity movement continues to inspire self-love and acceptance in a society full of impossible beauty standards, but one company’s efforts to celebrate bodies of all shapes and sizes just went seriously awry: Aerie has apologized after putting out a modeling casting call for “the most heinous, bizarre-looking women imaginable.”
Yikes. This definitely sends the wrong message about body positivity.
While Aerie has drawn praise in the past for the inclusion of nontraditional body types in their advertisements, the lingerie brand seemed to overplay their hand yesterday when it posted a casting call seeking out “the most, heinous, bizarre-looking women imaginable” to pose for its summer 2018 body positivity campaign. The listing immediately drew a public outcry from people offended by Aerie’s stated desire to find “wonky-looking women with weird-ass features” so the company can be “the first to ever tell these freaks that they’re beautiful.”
Advertisement

To its credit, Aerie quickly took responsibility for the misstep and issued an official apology today on its website:
We would like to express our sincere regret for the modeling casting call we released yesterday asking for “heinous, bizarre-looking women,” which upon review does not meet Aerie’s mission of inclusivity. While our goal was to make women who exist outside of the media’s narrow definition of beauty feel confident and appreciated, we now realize that asking for “total bottom-of-the-barrel girls” to model our swimwear does not accomplish that. At the time, we wrongfully believed that our request for models with “bulging cartoon eyes and towering slabs of forehead” would lead to an empowering moment of representation, but we can now see that referring to women as “lurching piles of misshapen parts” is in no way uplifting, and we deeply apologize for the hurt we have caused.”
Wow. While a judgment error like this will be hard to bounce back from, we’re impressed that Aerie owned up and apologized. Here’s hoping Aerie learned its lesson about how not to do body positivity and won’t make any more mistakes like this in the future.

Her Rightful Place: Mother Teresa Has Finally Ascended To Heaven After Serving Her Due Penance In Purgatory For Illegally Torrenting ‘Mrs. Doubtfire’,"It’s incredibly heartbreaking that despite dedicating her life to humanitarian service for the sick and the poor, Mother Teresa’s sins have prevented her from crossing through the shimmering gates of Heaven since her death in 1997. Fortunately, the news we’ve got today is going to make you stand up and cheer: Mother Teresa has finally ascended to Heaven after serving her due penance in purgatory for illegally torrenting Mrs. Doubtfire.
Yes! At long last Mother Teresa has claimed her rightful spot in paradise.
Early this morning, after spending the last 21 years suffering in torment and praying for God’s divine mercy to deliver her from her sin of pirating Mrs. Doubtfire in 1996, Mother Teresa ascended to Heaven at last and assumed the seat in the afterlife she was always meant to hold. Atoning for her evil decision to torrent the 1993 Robin Williams classic required that she make herself meek before the endless flame, but thanks to her unrelenting spirit and pursuit of forgiveness, the Heavenly Father forgave her and emerged from the fires after two decades with a purified soul and newfound understanding that when you choose to watch a copyrighted film, you need to follow the law and purchase it just like everyone else, lest you face the divine wrath of God.

This is absolutely wonderful news. It was such a shame that downloading a 2GB file called “Doubtifre_MRS.anonymous” from an internet message board prevented someone as selfless and pious as Mother Teresa from attaining the Kingdom of God after her death, but it’s so awesome to know that her penance has been completed and she’ll be happily basking in Heaven’s glory for all eternity.

This Will Change The Way You Watch ‘The Exorcist’,,NaN,2018-10-31T15:51:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,,Fake
J. Cole Said WHAT?!,"Happy Halloween! Ever wonder what’s on the mind of your favorite celebrity on this spooktacular day? Find out in today’s special edition of “They Said What?!”:
“SPLAT! Sean watched a gooey ooze dribble down his windshield. Apparently, it was raining…eggs? ‘Hey, designated dork!’ The taunt came from behind some hedges across the street. ‘You’re missing the party!’ SPLAT! Another egg exploded on his windshield. Sean grabbed some napkins and got out of his car with a sigh. ‘Yeah, that’s sort of the point,’ said Sean. ‘I’m not drinking tonight so I can drive drunk idiots like you home.’ The two egg hurlers exchanged looks of drunken confusion. ‘Whatever, loser.’ SPLAT! The egg hit Sean in the chest, and the two tipsy assailants stumbled their way back into the house party. As Sean wiped the splattered egg off the windshield, he couldn’t help but think that they kind of had a point. Instead of playing beer pong and partying with friends, he was wiping egg off of a windshield and playing bus driver for a bunch of wasted people. He was a loser. But he’d made peace long ago with the fact that this was just the price he’d have to pay to get into Harvard. Sean’s entire life revolved around getting into Harvard. He took all AP classes, including three foreign languages, was first-chair violin in the school orchestra, and spent his Friday and Saturday nights volunteering as a designated driver. He did all of these things, foregoing friendships and partying and fun for one reason: To one day don the crimson crest. Sitting in his car with egg shrapnel still plastered to his shirt, he tried to tell himself it would all be worth it. SPLAT! Oh, come on, really? He had just finished cleaning up the last eggs! But it wasn’t an egg. It was a human hand on his left-side window. And not just any hand. This particular hand was famous in Pine Grove. It belonged to Brian St. James, star quarterback and partier-in-chief. The visibly drunk St. James mumbled incoherently as he tapped on the window, his eyes struggling to focus on Sean’s face. Sean unlocked the back door and motioned for Brian to get in. After a brief struggle to decipher the puzzle of the door handle, Brian managed to open the door and collapse on Sean’s back seat. ‘Rough night?’ Sean asked, looking at Brian’s slumped frame in the rearview mirror. ‘Stomach…’ Brian mumbled, ‘Please…’ Sean started the car. ‘Try and channel that signature quarterback aim and contain your vomit to this guy, okay?’ Sean said, handing Brian a bucket. After many designated driving shifts, he was well-prepared for this situation. ‘All right, Brian. Let’s take you back home. What’s your address?’ Brian mumbled, ‘Highway…just…go…’ Sean started the car. ‘Aye, aye, cap’n.’ He drove down to the highway and started off in the direction of town, keeping an eye on Brian in the rearview. ‘All right, Brian,’ said Sean. ‘I’m on the highway. Now where should I go?’ No response from Brian. ‘Brian? Hey, Brian…’ Again, no response. He seemed to be asleep. ‘Brian!’ Brian moaned drunkenly, ‘Just…go…’ Sean was getting annoyed. ‘Brian, I can’t take you home if you don’t tell me where you live. And I can’t just drive you around aimlessly, okay? Other people need a designated driver tonight. Now please try and tell me your address.’ But Brian wasn’t making any sense at all at this point. His speech was just a jumble of random words. ‘Red…eyes…coming…highway…faster…’ Sean sighed. Spending his weekends shuttling blackout drunk jocks had better help him get into Harvard, otherwise he’ll have wasted his high school social life all for nothing. Then he had a terrifying realization—that might actually happen. He had never really considered it before. The possibility that doing all the right things—the right classes, the right extracurriculars, the right community service—still might not get him into Harvard. The thought sent a chill up his spine and a surge of anxious adrenaline coursing through his veins. And then he got mad. ‘Okay, Brian! You’re too drunk to tell me where you live, so guess what, buddy? You’re going back to the party. I don’t have time to babysit pathetic alcoholics-in-training like you. I’m trying to get into Harvard.’ Sean swung a U-turn and started heading back in the other direction. Suddenly, Brian grabbed his arm, sending the car swerving over the yellow line dividing the two-lane highway. ‘What the hell, Brian! Are you trying to kill us?’ Brian was squeezing his arm and mumbling, ‘No…please…it’s…coming…’ They swerved back and forth on the highway as Sean struggled to pry Brian’s hand off of his arm. But he just wasn’t strong enough. That hand had held on to footballs after being tackled by 300-pound linebackers; it wasn’t going to let go that easily, even in Brian’s drunken state. In desperation, Sean slammed on the brakes. The car went into a slide before finally screeching to a halt on the side of the road. Somehow, they were alive. ‘What’s wrong with you?’ Sean yelled, finally managing to wrest his arm back from Brian. But Brian didn’t respond. Before Sean knew what was happening, Brian was opening the door and lumbering down the highway in the opposite direction. ‘Goddamn it!’ Sean swore. Then, reflecting that letting blackout drunk football stars run out onto the highway in the middle of the night while ostensibly in his care wouldn’t help him get into Harvard, he got out of the car. Brian had evidently tripped in his drunken stupor and was now lying on his back on side of the road about 20 yards behind Sean’s car. ‘Okay, buddy,’ said Sean, leaning down over Brian. ‘Maybe remember this experience next time and lay off the booze.’ Brian looked Sean in the eyes for maybe the first time since getting in his car. He looked strangely afraid. ‘I’m…not…drunk…’ Sean scoffed. ‘Sure, pal. Whatever you say.’ Brian grabbed Sean’s arm again. ‘Stomach…hurt…’ Then Sean saw it—the red stain that had bloomed from Brian’s stomach. His letterman jacket had hidden it before, but now that he was lying down on his back, it was all too visible. Brian’s shirt had been torn to shreds and long, claw-shaped cuts coursed across his torso. It was a wonder he was still alive. ‘Oh, my God…Brian, what happened?’ Sean managed to say, looking in terror at Brian’s gushing wounds. ‘It…chased…me…’ mumbled Brian. ‘What? What chased you?’ Brian looked at Sean, struggling to breathe. ‘Red…eyes…” said Brian. That’s when Sean became aware of a strange purring sound coming from nearby. He had assumed it was the engine of the car. But it wasn’t coming from the car. It was coming from the forest that lined the highway. And looking into the shadows between the trees, he saw a pair of large, red eyes glowing in the darkness. They were the strangest eyes he’d ever seen. Both animal and somehow human. Then there was the smell…it smelled like…burning. ‘Hello, Sean,’ purred a guttural voice from the darkness. The eyes were growing bigger as the creature they belonged to came nearer. ‘What do you want?’ Sean cried, keenly aware that Brian was losing more and more blood with every passing moment. ‘It’s not about what I want, Sean,’ the creature purred. ‘But rather what you want.’ ‘I don’t understand,’ whimpered Sean. ‘Please, just leave us alone!’ A deep, horrible laugh bellowed from the darkness where the creature with the red eyes stood, cloaked in shadow. ‘Look at you, volunteering your weekends to drive around a bunch of high school drunks. You must really want to get into Harvard. I wonder…What else would you do to get into Harvard, Sean?’ Sean could feel a strange heat emanating from the forest. It was making him sweat. ‘I don’t know!’ Sean cried. The creature then emerged from the forest and Sean could see it clearly for the first time. In addition to its large, red eyes, it also had red scales, a wide, fanged smile, and foot-long, razor-sharp claws. It was human and beast in one, and it was staring right at Sean. ‘I can make it happen, Sean. That and so much more. All I ask is one thing…’ The creature pointed one of its claws at Brian. ‘Let me feast on your friend, and all of your hard work will pay off,’ purred the creature, the heat from its skin singeing the hairs on Sean’s arms. Sean looked at Brian. His breathing was growing more and more shallow, and he looked up at Sean with desperation. Slowly, Sean stood up and gazed into the red eyes of the terrible creature. The thing smiled at him, an impossibly wide smile that showed off multiple rows of fangs. Then, one step at a time, Sean walked back to his car. ‘Please…no…’ he heard Brian plead to his back. Sean got in his car and turned the engine on. In the rearview mirror, he saw the creature step out into the road beside Brian. It locked eyes with Sean and let out a victorious laugh, its mouth gaping up at the starless night sky, drinking it in. Sean then took a deep breath, shifted into reverse, and slammed on the accelerator. The creature’s laugh stopped suddenly as its red eyes focused on Sean’s car rapidly reversing in its direction. ‘No!’ The thing shrieked. SPLAT! Sean slammed on the breaks. He didn’t look back to see what damage he had done. He shifted into drive, and screeched up alongside Brian. He got out of the car and pulled Brian into the back seat. ‘Thank…you…’ said Brian. Not once looking back, Sean got in the driver’s seat and floored it in the direction of the hospital. Maybe he would get into Harvard. Maybe he wouldn’t. He didn’t know. The only thing Sean did know was that tonight, he had looked the devil in the eyes. And he would never be the same.”

—J. Cole On the scariest story he has ever heard",NaN,2018-10-31T13:39:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--MY5drhrD--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/kwkhwmhpzwg71rkw8dmf.jpg",Fake
What Could Have Been: 4 Scrapped Design Concepts That Paul Thomas Anderson Almost Used For Dirk Diggler’s Penis In ‘Boogie Nights’,"From beginning to end, Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights contains masterful production design, perfectly capturing the look and feel of Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, the most memorable aspect of the film’s design is the prosthetic for Dirk Diggler’s famously large penis, which went through several variations before the version infamously included in the film’s very last shot. Here are four scrapped design concepts for Dirk Diggler’s penis that nearly made it into the film!

One of the first design teams enlisted to bring Dirk Diggler’s penis to life was none other than The Jim Henson Company, whose puppetry and animatronics had previously produced the mesmerizing special effects seen in films like Labyrinth and The Dark Crystal. Ultimately, its model was rejected due to technical difficulties, specifically keeping the puppeteers who operated the penis out of frame. Rare test footage of the Jim Henson Dirk Diggler penis shows a few creative solutions that Anderson employed to hide the puppeteers when Diggler dropped trou in the film’s final scene, such as using full-body prosthetics to have them blend in as Mark Wahlberg’s bare legs, or hiding a puppeteer behind Wahlberg with their arm reaching through his crotch and operating the puppet by hand. Sadly, these fixes didn’t work, but they are still an incredible showcase of Anderson’s filmmaking ingenuity.

At the time Anderson was completing Boogie Nights, Hollywood’s biggest name in digital effects was Pixar, which was riding high in the wake of its first feature film, Toy Story. Anderson recruited the groundbreaking studio to craft Dirk Diggler’s penis—a bold move for a rookie filmmaker, considering that CGI technology was still in its formative stages. To Anderson’s disappointment, Pixar’s animation wizardry couldn’t portray Dirk Diggler’s penis in a way that blended seamlessly with the grainy, warm film the rest of the movie was shot on. Worse still, the large eyes and huge grin on Dirk Diggler’s penis caused test audiences to run screaming from the room. Anderson was forced to part ways with Pixar, but it’s cool to see the fun, colorful concept they had envisioned for Diggler’s impressive genitals.

In what would’ve been every film buff’s dream collaboration, Paul Thomas Anderson briefly worked with H.R. Giger, the Swiss visual artist whose iconic style made Alien an all-time classic. According to P.T. Anderson’s DVD commentary, he was so inspired by Giger’s design that he began rewriting scenes around this concept, including one where Dirk Diggler’s coke-fueled falling out with Burt Reynolds’ character, Jack Horner, ended with his penis biting Horner’s throat out. In the end, Anderson made the tough but necessary decision that Giger’s Diggler penis was “tonally out-of-place” amid Boogie Nights’ otherwise vibrant depiction of 1970s California. Still, you can’t help but fantasize about how incredible Boogie Nights would’ve been had he opted to run with Giger’s concept art.

Yup, you can bet this would’ve made Boogie Nights an almost entirely different film. Leonardo DiCaprio was actually the actor Anderson originally envisioned playing Dirk Diggler’s penis when he first wrote the screenplay. Though DiCaprio said that he loved the script, he was committed to Titanic at the time, and had to turn down the part, forcing Anderson to work with prosthetic genitalia instead. Luckily, with this storyboard art made during pre-production, movie geeks can get a glimpse of what Dirk Diggler’s penis would have looked like had it been portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. Of course, the final cut that made it to theaters remains a classic, but it’s super cool to see how different Boogie Nights would’ve been if Leo had been Dirk Diggler’s penis!",NaN,2018-10-31T12:26:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--FudFMnc4--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/bwfhcraw2gmxgdqjushs.jpg",Fake
Huge Win: Norway Has Reduced All Of Its Numbers By 97%,"As if universal healthcare, low crime rates, and high happiness levels weren’t reason enough to move to Norway, the Scandinavian country has just left pretty much every other nation in the dust in possibly the most significant way yet: Norway has managed to reduce all of its numbers by a whopping 97 percent.
Um, time to apply for Norwegian citizenship, like, right now!
At a time when numbers in most other countries are at an all-time high, Norway has managed to shrink even some of its most massive numbers down to next to nothing. Brilliantly, it’s managed to reduce things like dog attacks and swimming from 92 to 2.76. Forest fires, public transportation, and the ocean have all decreased from 17 to 0.51, and many things that used to be 138 are now 4.14.

In the U.S., the numbers can get into the thousands, but in Norway, thanks to the country’s consistent efforts, most of the numbers have shrunk to close to 0. 
Let that sink in for a minute. The rest of the world looks pretty backwards compared to Norway right about now.
Norway’s incredible number reduction should give hope for every nation whose numbers are way too high. The statistics don’t lie: Recent stats show that Norway is currently at 19, compared to Sweden’s 261, Brazil’s 927.5, and the U.S.’s whopping 65,012. If Norway can pull it off, there’s really no reason for any nation to continue to have large numbers like 179,481, when they could follow Norway’s lead and get them down to smaller alternatives, such as 6.

No matter what your political beliefs, everyone can agree that if numbers can be made smaller, they should be. By reducing all of its numbers so drastically, Norway has set an example for the rest of the international community to follow.

A Tragic Loss: 6 Astronauts On The International Space Station Have Died While Attempting To Wear Witch Costumes In Space For Halloween,"Millions are in mourning today following a deadly Halloween-related incident that claimed the lives of some of the world’s bravest and most accomplished space explorers: Officials have confirmed that six astronauts on board the International Space Station died today after attempting to wear witch costumes in space to celebrate Halloween.
This is a truly devastating loss. Our hearts go out to the friends and loved ones of these courageous astronauts whose love for Halloween ended up costing them their lives.

The tragedy occurred early this morning when astronaut Lt. Stewart McPherson began a live webcam stream in which he appeared with five other astronauts all wearing witch costumes. Lt. McPherson looked into the camera and said, “Happy Halloween from all of us evil witches on the International Space Station! Now we shall fly into outer space and do the Devil’s bidding!”
The six astronauts then all started doing a high-pitched cackle before they opened the airlock and leaped into space screaming, “Fly, my evil brethren, fly!” Within moments of exiting the airlock, the astronauts were all floating lifelessly in space dressed in the pointed hats and robes they had purchased from Party City before they left Earth.
Approximately three minutes later a sixth astronaut jumped out of the airlock in a witch’s costume even though she could clearly see her five colleagues floating dead right in front of her. She passed away moments later.

The astronauts had also brought broomsticks with them as they left the space station so that they could float around on them in zero-gravity as though they were real witches, which officials say would have been a “truly spooky trick” had the astronauts not suffocated in the vacuum of space before they got a chance to pull it off.
A rescue shuttle was swiftly dispatched to the ISS to retrieve the bodies of the six scary astronauts, but sadly the four astronauts aboard this second spacecraft were also celebrating Halloween and went into space all dressed as Michael Myers from the Halloween movie franchise. Within moments these astronauts were also dead, and now NASA is left trying to figure out how to retrieve the corpses of the six witches and four Michael Myers that are drifting together outside the space station.
This is absolutely heartbreaking. It’s safe to say that this is the saddest Halloween in the history of space travel. Hopefully next year the ISS astronauts can pull off a fun Halloween scare without anyone dying!

5 Signs You’re The 900-Pound German Guy Of Your Friend Group,"Every friend group’s got a 900-pound German guy, and even though no one ever thinks it’s them, there’s always a chance that it might be you. Here are five signs it’s time to admit you’re the 900-pound German man in your friend group.
If on trivia night your friends always turn to you for any question about being massive and German and you always get those questions right, odds are it’s because you’re the group’s resident 900-pound German guy. Next time your trivia team gets a question like “What is the only company that builds a German-language talking scale that goes over 800 pounds?” and your friends all look at you awaiting an answer before you confidently blurt out, “Honeywell!” take it as a surefire sign that among your friends, you’re the 900-pound German guy.

The food and drink your friends order for you can tell you a lot about the way they perceive you. If you arrive 20 minutes late to dinner and your friends have jumped to the conclusion that you’re going to be hungry for hundreds of pounds of kraut and thirsty for a huge tankard of mustard, that’s a pretty big hint that they see you as a 900-pound German guy.
Nothing says “We see you as a big fat German guy” like sending someone multiple pairs of XXXXXL pairs of sweatpants with the word “Germany” embroidered in an arch across the ass for the holidays. Getting sweatpants like these for Christmas should make a little light go on in your head telling you that maybe, just maybe, you’re the extremely chubby German guy in your circle. Make that two little lights going off in your head if those sweatpants fit your body perfectly and match all the other “Germany” sweatpants already in your wardrobe.

Noting people’s reactions to your behavior is a great way to determine whether you’re the gargantuan German man of your social circle. Pay attention to subtle hints, like how people react when you scream, “I’m hungry!” or, “Bring me some fucking liver sausage!” in German versus how they react when you calmly say, “I’m not really hungry right now,” in perfect English. If the latter is more surprising to them, you might need to own up to the fact that you’re the one in your friend group who most fits the 900-pound German guy archetype.
Next time you and your friends are doing an escape room together, pay close attention to how they react to any challenges that involve eating through massive quantities of German sausages. If they just all automatically assume you’re going take the lead, it’s time to admit you’re the 900-pound German guy of your group.

"Dangerous Knowledge:
Jerry Seinfeld Has Gone Insane After Attaining Complete Understanding
Of The Deal With Dry Cleaning","There are some truths that are best left unknown, horrific secrets that will shatter any mind that dares to learn them, and, tragically, one of the world’s most beloved comedians has precipitated his own undoing in pursuit of such forbidden knowledge: Jerry Seinfeld has gone completely insane after attaining full understanding of the deal with dry cleaning.
That poor fool! You really hate to see something like this happen.
After years of wondering about how dry cleaning works, Seinfeld recently ventured into a library and searched through dark and mildewing shelves of the reference section until he found an accursed book about industrial garment care. As he read the ancient tome, the hapless stand-up’s eyes widened in shock and tears streamed down his face while his mouth formed into a rictus grin of horrified delight. Hours later he put down the book and maniacally cackled, “I understand the deal now. I understand the deal with dry cleaning!”

Upon returning home, Seinfeld was a changed man from his usual jovial self. He began writing on the walls of his mansion in red pen, spending days without sleep scrawling the arcane methods behind dry cleaning on every available surface. Over the subsequent weeks Seinfeld’s hair grew unkempt, his nails long and yellow, but his clothing appeared cleaner than ever. Worried family and friends tried to talk to the unhinged celeb, but all they could get out of Seinfeld were maddened nonsensical explanations about how dry cleaning isn’t actually dry, despite not using water.
The final straw was an appearance Seinfeld made at the Comedy Cellar in New York, where instead of performing his usual tight five, he walked onstage and uttered the deal with dry cleaning. “Dry cleaning. Ever wonder about that?” began the comic. “Two words that completely contradict each other. To clean something, you must get it wet. Or must thou? Until now, its deal was shrouded in secrecy, but no more. I have unraveled the paradox of dry cleaning. I comprehend its whole deal. You, too, will be awakened to the deal, as I have been.” Seinfeld then spoke the deal with dry cleaning, causing everyone in the audience to go insane.
Many comedy fans stabbed out their eyes and ears with pens to avoid learning more of the deal with dry cleaning. Others ran out into the street to throw themselves into oncoming traffic and end their suffering. The truly unlucky Seinfeld fans sitting in the first row, who heard more of the deal with dry cleaning than others, are now trapped in a catatonic state, staring blankly into space, unable to move or say anything beyond “dry cleaning.”

For public safety, the legendary funnyman was committed to an asylum for life, and locked in a padded room. Seinfeld is now being forced to wear a straitjacket and muzzle to stop him from writing or talking so that the deal with dry cleaning cannot be spread to another victim and destroy their sanity—a horrible yet necessary protective measure.
What a devastating tragedy, beget from Jerry Seinfeld’s hubris! While this is an incredibly unfortunate outcome for both Seinfeld and fans of comedy, here’s hoping that the Bee Movie actor’s self-inflicted downfall will serve as a cautionary tale to prevent others from making similar mistakes in the future.",NaN,2018-10-30T10:26:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--aenm4pVb--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/xmkqb48xwbe2fkoecjnl.jpg",Fake
"Incredible: Linguists Have Finally Uncovered The English Meaning Of The Phrase ‘Sayonara, Suckers’","This fascinating development is a must-read for anyone interested in decoding the mysteries of human language: Linguists have finally uncovered the English meaning of the phrase “Sayonara, suckers.”
Wow. It is beyond exciting to see a puzzle like this one solved at long last. There’s no telling what doors of understanding this will open for linguists across the globe!

A research group in the linguistics department at the University of Pennsylvania had been working to decipher the meaning of “Sayonara, suckers” for several years before reaching a breakthrough earlier this week. “After cross-referencing early Latin texts with modern-day slang and transliterating various Japanese characters into English syllables, we’ve come to the conclusion that the once-mysterious phrase means something like ‘goodbye,’ but with a tone of disrespect,” explained lead researcher Helen Greenwald. “Written sources we recently uncovered  helped us ascertain that “Sayonara, suckers” is usually intended as a type of parting pleasantry that one might use while riding away on a motorcycle after having triumphed over two or more people.”
Amazing. This is an incredible discovery that can only mean good things for those of us trying to better understand language’s impact on the world and how we communicate with each other.

Incredibly Sad: This Guy Got His College Diploma Framed,"Buckle up, because this story about Tim Lansen of Oakland, CA is going to be a real downer: Tim got his college diploma professionally framed.
Good god. This truly is as sad as it gets. Don’t read on unless you’re prepared to have your mood ruined for the day.

Despite the fact that it’s been nine years since he graduated with a bachelor’s of sociology from Syracuse, Tim is so inexplicably proud of his degree that he went to a custom shop and got it framed. Both of Tim’s parents went to Syracuse, too, so it’s not as if his getting accepted and finishing out four years there was some kind of unexpected accomplishment. Worst of all, Tim hung the diploma right across from the couch in his living room, as if he thinks it will serve as a conversational centerpiece when he has guests over. The sad truth is that Tim will be lucky if he gets even one comment from a houseguest about how they think they know someone else who went to Syracuse around the same time he did.
This is just awful. Tim, we will keep you in our thoughts. 
While it might make sense for a doctor or lawyer to frame their diploma and hang it in their office in order to prove their credentials, it’s just straight-up tragic to see Tim, a social media manager, get his measured, matted, and framed at the age of 30. It’s unclear who Tim thinks he’s impressing—but honestly, if anyone gives a shit about Tim’s minor in political science at this point, they’re in an even sadder situation than he is. There’s a chance that Tim’s parents enjoy seeing a framed college diploma on their son’s wall, but even they would probably prefer something like a nice family photo.

"I’m No Expert, But Elevators Should Do Other Things","I’m not the kind of person who likes to speak out of turn, but when I see something that is wrong, I can’t just stay silent—I have to address it. It may not feel comfortable, but in order to start a dialogue, someone has to be the one to begin the conversation. So this is what I believe, all cards on the table: If you ask me, elevators should do other things.
Look, I’ll be the first to admit that I’m no elevator expert. I didn’t grow up studying physics or engineering—elevators are not my world. But to me it’s clear as day that elevators should at least have a bench for the elderly or a little interactive trivia screen or something, and I don’t think I’m alone in that belief.

Obviously, elevators are complex machines, and the average person can’t claim to know everything about how they work or what they do. However, anyone can see that there’s a huge gap between the number of things elevators do right now and the number of things they could be doing. For instance, trains, buses, and subways all have loops you are allowed to hold on to, and yet currently, elevators have no form of loop at all. It’s a troubling discrepancy. It’s also worth noting that elevators are essentially tiny rooms, so at best they should probably have multiple phone chargers and at the very least you should be able to expect a small trash can. Inexplicably, elevators offer neither of these conveniences.
What’s particularly baffling is the many features elevators currently have that never get used and could be easily replaced with something more practical. Like, what’s the deal with the button that calls the fire department? Never once have I seen anyone use this button, and even if there were an emergency situation that merited calling the fire department, I imagine most people would just call them on their cell phones, as cell phones seem like a much safer bet than a button that goes years at a time without being pressed. Why not replace that button with something pragmatic, like a button that triggers a blast of loud, overpowering white noise to preempt unwanted small talk with chatty strangers, or a button that activates different mood-lighting settings, like “tranquil morning” or “morning safari.” Seems like a no-brainer.
Again, I do not claim to design or maintain elevators, so everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt, but it only seems logical that if elevators can go up and down big tall buildings, they should also be going back and forth through long flat buildings. It just makes sense. And if elevators have the power to haul thousand-pound passenger loads up and down all day long without issue, then perhaps we could utilize them for other physically demanding tasks, such as crushing olives to make olive oil or pressing coal to make diamonds. That way, the elevators would be generating a useful byproduct as well as passive income—a win-win, if you ask me.

And while perhaps not as practical, let’s not overlook the many untapped entertainment possibilities of elevators. To my untrained eye, it feels like we’re wasting a huge opportunity by not having a video screen on elevator walls that streams one of those live zoo feeds where you watch bears playing or eggs hatching in a nest. Or maybe there could be some sort of fun activity for riders to do. Like, maybe you put a big heavy crank in the middle that people have to work together to turn, or maybe there’s some sort of Mario Party-style game where everyone has to mash a button really fast to make little digital avatars race on a screen, and whoever mashes their button the fastest is the winner. Speaking of which, it seems like it’d be a big morale booster if every elevator ride ended with a passenger being declared the winner. It’s honestly frustrating that no system for determining winners exists yet.
Also: Call me naïve, but I believe it’s possible to live in a world where you can get on an elevator and when you get off that same elevator moments later, you have washed your hands.
I want to make it clear that I am not an enemy of elevators. If anything, I am their biggest fan. And if someone like me, who knows virtually nothing about elevators, can see all this potential for what they can be, I know the rest of the world can, too.

Extremely Brave: Strong President Donald Trump Is Courageously Sitting On His Toilet In A Gas Mask While The White House Gets Fumigated,"Once again, our flawless and incredibly wealthy and handsome President Donald John Trump has proven that he is the bravest man in the world. As we speak, strong President Donald Trump is courageously sitting on his toilet in a gas mask while the White House gets fumigated.
Another day, another act of unsurpassed courage from our glistening President Trump! Not even poisonous gas can keep our powerful president from using the toilet he loves!

“Although President Trump was repeatedly warned that the White House was getting pumped full of poisonous fumes as part of a routine pest control procedure, he simply responded, ‘Nobody tells me where to shit,’ before venturing into the noxious environment so he could defecate in his normal toilet,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters this morning, adding that she was very proud of our billionaire president as exterminators continued to fill the White House with pesticides behind her. “While many presidents, like cowardly Obama, would be too afraid to use the White House bathroom under these circumstances, President Trump was strong and rich enough to do it, and he’ll probably be in there for another couple of hours.”
As you read these words, it is mandatory that you stand up and salute your computer, because President Donald John Trump is sitting on his toilet in a cloud of poison, just like Superman!
White House sources have also confirmed that at one point during his toilet conquest, President Trump stood up and wandered with his pants down through the haze of poisonous gas clouding the empty halls of the White House while still wearing his gas mask. Then, much like the alpha male Rambo would probably do, President Trump wandered back to the bathroom and resumed using the toilet, but even harder.

Libtards take note: This is the way that masculine presidents show the world that America is the strongest nation on Earth. When all the bugs and mice in the White House are finally dead and the building is cleared of the toxic fumes, President Donald John Trump will remain, seated on the toilet in his gas mask, basking in his glorious victory.

"Beautiful! Habitat For Humanity Just Committed To Building 5,000 Haunted Houses In America’s Poorest Regions This October","Prepare to have your faith in humanity restored, because one of our country’s most generous nonprofits is doing something truly amazing for the less fortunate: Habitat for Humanity just committed to building 5,000 haunted houses in America’s poorest regions just in time for Halloween.
Beautiful! It’s great to see people recognizing spooktacular thrills and chills as an essential human right.

For millions of Americans, poverty means going without basic necessities that the rest of us take for granted, but Habitat for Humanity just vowed to give these people the bone-chilling Halloween scares they deserve by constructing 5,000 new haunted houses in the country’s most underprivileged communities by the end of the month. In an announcement this morning, Habitat detailed its ambitious plan to mobilize several hundred teams of volunteers and professional builders to construct haunted houses fully equipped with eerie, winding corridors, ambience-enhancing fog machines, and no fewer than 10 jump-scares per location. Even with volunteer labor, the endeavor will cost in the tens of millions of dollars, but considering how many needy Americans will finally have somewhere they can go to be spooked by cackling skeletons and howled at by an actor in a wolfman costume, those millions will be money well spent.
“From cauldrons full of dry ice to gurneys strewn with hyper-realistic guts, these haunted houses will have all the amenities necessary to provide heart-pounding horror to the Americans who need it most,” said Habitat for Humanity CEO Jonathan Reckford in a press statement. “One in five Americans don’t know where their next Halloween frightfest will come from, and it’s important that we do everything we can to change that.”
The effort is also getting a helping hand from former U.S. President and longtime Habitat proponent Jimmy Carter, who has personally recorded an hour-long ambient track featuring sound effects of dragging chains, creaking doors, and hair-raising shrieks to be played on loop over the loudspeakers at the haunted houses. Habitat is even going so far as to truck in fresh groceries to the haunted houses being built in food deserts to ensure that food-insecure neighborhoods will have the pasta and peeled grapes necessary to display bowls full of monster brains and eyeballs.

Personal Transformation: The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric Has Changed His Name To The Bluetooth Symbol,"It’s always fascinating to watch artists reinvent themselves, but this performer may have just had one of the boldest personal transformations that pop culture has seen yet: The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric has changed his name to the Bluetooth symbol.
Wow. This is definitely an incredible step in the artistic evolution of The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric.

In a press release earlier this morning, The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric’s publicist announced that her client has legally changed his name to the Bluetooth corporate trademark and respectfully asks to be referred to as such in print journalism, personal appearances, and on-screen credits. 
Ladies and gentleman, Cedric The Entertainer is no more. Now Cedric The Entertainer’s name is this:

The bold name change comes from The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric’s desire to make an explicit distinction between his past body of work and this completely new era performing under the moniker of the Bluetooth symbol, an abstract emblem which he believes to embody the “mysterious and cosmic comedy that has long been a signature component of [his] public persona.”

A Sacred Bacchanal: The Fleetwood Mac Cover Band Is In Town For Its Annual Show So It’s Time For Mom To Get Completely Wasted Off Two Coronitas And Start Grinding,"This sacred occasion has long been foreshadowed by posters hung in community centers and half-page ads in the local newspaper, but now as lawn chairs are erected and cheese plates brought forth from picnic baskets, it is clear that the blessed hour is upon us at last: The Fleetwood Mac cover band has arrived in town for its annual show, and now it is time for Mom to get completely wasted off two Coronitas and start grinding.
Huzzah! The swaying High Priestess has arrived at the public park in her Toyota Sienna, and now the tipsy revelry shall commence!
Advertisement

Adorned in her ceremonial garb of a strangely baggy pink Nordstrom Rack blouse, white jeans, monogrammed Vera Bradley bag, and a jangly assortment of chunky beaded jewelry, Mom lays her blanket down on a patch of grass that, per ancient concert-on-the-lawn decree, is not so close to the stage that the speakers hurt her ears but not so far back that she must don her prescription sunglasses to see the performance. She then patiently waits and sips upon her Coronita until the band, Macwood Fleet, arrives onstage at 6 p.m. sharp and inaugurates the festivities with a spirited rendition of “The Chain,” the familiar opening chords of which compel Mom to put her beverage down and begin clapping her hands over her head in her traditional almost-on-beat fashion.
She is in her element. She is feeling it.
As the evening progresses, she sips again and again on her Coronita, finishing her first bottle in a record 45 minutes, leaving her somehow incredibly drunk. Then, as she opens her second Coronita, the gods shine their favor upon her and the band launches into her absolute favorite Fleetwood Mac song, “Go Your Own Way.” Delirious from drink and three-part rock ’n’ roll harmonies, she attempts to summon Dad from his lawn chair to join her in dance, but he prefers to stay seated in his lawn chair reading a Tom Clancy novel. Undeterred by his refusal, she then throws back several more ounces of Coronita and proceeds to perform a G-rated lap dance for him, writhing blissfully against his knee caps while he remains rigid and joyless, inwardly yearning to be home watching Shark Tank reruns on CNBC. He, however, knows that this is an occasion of great importance for Mom, and so he forces a smile and nods in agreement when his bride, now profoundly inebriated, breathily yell-whispers in his ear that the lead singer “sounds more like Stevie Nicks than Stevie Nicks”—a sentiment she will repeat six more times throughout the night.

And lo, as the sky now pinkens and the band enters the stretch of Rumours tracks that customarily closes out the set, drunken Mom suddenly becomes very emotional about the terrible velocity of time and how her babies are no longer babies, and she feels a very urgent need to be near her babies and to hold them. She then beelines straight for her youngest son and engages him in the hallowed rite of passage that all of her offspring must at some time in their lives endure: the uncomfortable slow dance to “Landslide” that you are exactly one year too old for. Mom is in rare form tonight, and she sings the line about being “afraid of changing” with audible sadness, pulling her 12-year-old close so that she may smell his hair—the sweet-smelling hair of her sweet baby boy who was once inside her but now, in his pubescence, has eclipsed her in both height and mass and who, she fears, may be too old and self-conscious to let her smell his hair in public by the time Macwood Fleet comes around next year. A single tear rolls down her cheek.
“Landslide” ends, but not the night. No, as has been ordained since the beginning of time, the night cannot truly end until Mom hears “Rhiannon,” which, right on cue, the band now begins playing. Mom closes her eyes, cracks a fresh Coronita, sashays to the center of the park, and gives the assembled masses the purest art she can give: that one dance where her right arm is extended out in front of her and her left arm hangs down by her side for some reason. She dances this dance with all the besotted passion she can muster until Dad trudges over and informs her that they need to leave before the encore so they can beat traffic. And, finally, the night comes to an end.
Incredible. Another year comes and goes, and Mom and her Coronitas and Fleetwood Mac cover band  have once again worked their impossible magic. Let the countdown to next year begin!

Disaster: A No-Nonsense Grandma Has Started Hanging Her Laundry Off The St. Louis Arch And Everyone’s Too Scared To Tell Her To Stop,"With no easy answers or distinct signs of progress, this story unfolding in the heart of Missouri is an unmitigated catastrophe: A no-nonsense grandma has started hanging her laundry off the St. Louis Arch and everyone’s too scared to tell her to stop.
God, how terrible for St. Louis. This grandmother and her laundry don’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.
Advertisement

The problem came to light when the St. Louis police department received numerous calls about a clothesline covered in bedsheets and large white blouses strung up across St. Louis’ Gateway Arch. Upon arriving at the scene, two officers encountered St. Louis resident Estelle DeLillo, a woman of about 75 with curlers in her hair knitting a sweater in a rocking chair next to the monument. Estelle began shaking a rolled-up newspaper above her head and barking, “Don’t touch!” as soon as the officers approached her, giving both policemen no choice but to back away from the stern grandmother.
Although St. Louis’ mayor attempted to personally intervene after Estelle added a second clothesline full of hand-knit afghans to the arch, he was unable to get far before she boxed his ears for “sticking his nose in other people’s business.” Thousands of St. Louis residents eventually came together to sign an online petition asking Estelle to move her laundry elsewhere—a last-ditch effort that ultimately proved to be as fruitless as every other attempt to reason with the stubborn elderly woman. The community’s plea was met with a dismissive response, as Estelle simply waved them off by saying, “I can’t see that, I don’t have email,” and turned back to the extremely loud, staticky TV set on which she had been watching The Bold And The Beautiful.
By all appearances, this situation is only continuing to get worse. There’s just no getting through to her.

Last week, Estelle made an official statement on the issue to a local newspaper, saying, “If you think I’m going to pay 75 cents to those crooks at the laundromat to dry my clothes, you’re crazy. I’m using this arch—get your own.” Several visitors to the city have since been scared away from taking pictures under the arch after Estelle shooed them with a broom, which may portend dire consequences for the St. Louis tourism industry.
Unfortunately, Estelle’s stance does not seem to be changing anytime soon. The authorities need to figure out a plan B, because trying to reason with her is simply way too intimidating.

Twitter Explosion: Kenmore Is Going Off After Finding Out That Nobody Uses The Circular Glass Plate That Your Food Rotates On Inside The Microwave As A Regular Plate Too,"If you happen to own a Kenmore microwave, you might want to brace yourself, because it looks like the household appliance company has a serious bone to pick with you. Kenmore just absolutely went off after finding out that nobody uses the circular glass plate that your food rotates on inside the microwave as a regular plate, too.

Woof. Kenmore is really fuming over this one, and it doesn’t look like it’ll be cooling down any time soon. It’ll be interesting to see if the appliance brand’s outburst is the last we hear about the misunderstanding, or if the rage we saw today was only the tip of the iceberg.

Ah Jeez: This Kid’s Family Is Making Everyone At His Sleepover Say Grace Before Eating Little Caesars,"Things definitely just got weird for the group of 9-year-olds who were enjoying what was, up until this point, an all-around fun and normal sleepover at Zach Olsen’s house: According to sources, Zach’s parents are making everyone at his sleepover say grace before eating Little Caesars.
Woof. Is it really necessary to ask for God’s blessing on a couple of $5 Hot-N-Readys?
Advertisement

After spending the previous four hours playing Fortnite and goofing off in the basement, moments ago the six attendees of Zach’s sleepover bolted upstairs for dinner, ready to dig into the pizzas Mrs. Olsen brought home from Little Caesars. But just when the kids were about to start stuffing their faces, Zach’s dad took his wife’s hand and bowed his head, signaling that apparently they’re the kind of family that prays before meals, even meals at sleepovers, and that they expect everyone to participate. After several moments of uncomfortable silence, the boys followed suit and bowed their heads, joining in on a solemn religious ritual when literally just five minutes prior they were trying to make themselves fart on command in the basement.
And if you thought they’d just say grace super quick as a formality, think again. The prayer’s already been going for a good 45 seconds, and Zach’s dad just got a little quiver in his voice as he asked God to bless the food to the nourishment of the boys’ bodies, which definitely seems a bit overkill for a dinner of cheap pepperoni pizza and a two-liter of caffeine-free Mountain Dew, especially considering that all these kids want to do is eat as fast as they can so they can go back to the basement and play Grand Theft Auto V or maybe watch an R-rated movie with boobs in it. The good news is that they’re at least in the privacy of a home and not at a restaurant, because Zach’s family is no doubt the kind that joins hands and prays out loud right in the middle of Olive Garden, making everyone at all the other tables feel super weird.
Yikes. This truly is one of the last things you ever want to happen at a sleepover. Here’s hoping that the prayer wraps up soon so that the kids can just eat their food and get back to dicking around in the basement.

Let Them Drink: 9 Toddlers Who Are Dressed Like Stylish Little Grown-ups And Therefore Deserve To Be Given Alcohol,"The drinking age may be 21, but that doesn’t mean you can’t bend the rules a little bit for toddlers who are dressed up like classy, miniature adults. Here are nine children under 4 who deserve to be served alcohol because of the way they’re dressed. 
Advertisement

Any bartender who wouldn’t pour this well-dressed little fella a beer is a complete asshole. Sure, the law states that children should not be given alcohol, but those laws weren’t written with kids dressed like fancy little businessmen in mind. Michael is really rocking his suit vest and wire-framed glasses, and his untucked tie is just the icing on the cake. There’s absolutely no reason this kid shouldn’t be given an adult-sized mug of porter to have all to himself, followed by as many more mugs as he wants.
Advertisement

Look, if this little clotheshorse walked into a liquor store and set a bottle of brandy on the counter, the right thing to do would clearly be to sell it to him, no questions asked. All wisdom regarding not letting toddlers have booze goes out the window when you’re talking about a cool customer like this who’s simply owning the unbuttoned-gingham-suit-with-a-misplaced-bowtie look. If a kid’s dressed like this you give them booze. Period.

Kaylee may only be 2, but when she’s wearing this edgy punk ensemble, you’d be utterly remiss not to serve her as much alcohol as she wants to drink, be it beer, wine, or hard liquor and spirits. Just let her drink. She deserves it.

Yeah, so if a toddler has a perfectly tailored tuxedo that they actually own and not rent, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with setting a stiff martini and a cigar on their toy piano for them to sip and puff in between tunes. It’s that easy. When a preschooler is dressed like someone who drinks and smokes stogies, then  they should be able to do so. No pediatrician, cop, or parent can argue with that.
Advertisement

Here’s the thing: All of those studies that say alcohol is bad for kids were based on kids who dress like babies. On the other hand, a little dandy like Connor—who dresses more grown-up than most so-called adults—deserves a little vodka in his bottle for having himself so put together. Connor would blend right in at a fancy gallery opening in New York or on a red carpet in L.A., and that’s why you should have no reservations about mixing him a nice, strong Long Island Iced Tea. We’re not talking about a sip off Dad’s drink. Get Connor his own damn cocktail.

It’s absolute horse shit that we live in a world where there are people who would deny a toddler dressed like this a tall glass of straight liquor. What, you think Tia can’t handle her booze just because she’s 3? Look at the way she’s dressed! Tia’s got herself put together like a true fashionista, and that merits an unlimited flow of Kahlúa directly into her sippy cup.

Even the most ardent teetotaler has got to admit that if a toddler is dressed in chambray and a brightly colored bowtie like they just stepped out of a J. Crew catalog like our little Tyler here, then that entitles said toddler to a gin and tonic. Keep in mind, just because Tyler is under 4 doesn’t mean the drink can’t be mixed pretty stiff: He is, after all, dressed just like an adult.

Give Rainn here a bottle of tequila with a crazy straw in it, because by dressing to the nines, this kid has earned the right to double-fist Bloody Marys after a long day at pre-school. Hell, light him a cigarette, too, while you’re at it. Cheers, Rainn.

Hard-Hitting Journalism: A 7-Year Joint Investigation Between ‘The New York Times’ And Kevin Hart Has Found That Women Take Too Long To Put On Makeup,"A groundbreaking work of journalism was just published that’s quickly taken the internet by storm. A joint investigation by The New York Times and stand-up comedian Kevin Hart has found that women take too long to put on makeup.
This is courageous, world-class reporting from Kevin Hart and the paper of record.

According to Hart’s investigation, which pulled from interviews with hundreds of sources, women will often tell their husbands that they only need five minutes to put on makeup, but they must be looking at some sort of special clock just for women because when they say “five minutes,” they really mean “anywhere between one hour and never.”
“Over the past seven years I have spoken to hundreds of husbands who are hungry and waiting for their wives to get their makeup on, because it’s dinnertime and they were supposed to leave a long time ago,” wrote Hart in the story, which appeared on the front page of the Times today. “The harsh reality is that women take so long to get ready for dinner you have to wonder if they brought snacks up there or something. It’s like when you say, ‘Let’s go eat dinner at 7,’ she just hears, ‘Start doing your hair up around 7:15 and then take as long as you want.’ And somehow we still get to the restaurant the same time as our friends! Are the women coordinating?”
One of the most shocking pieces of data Hart’s article revealed is that the five words that a man absolutely never wants to hear from his girlfriend are, “Let me do my makeup,” because when men hear those five words, the night’s over. They’re done. Their house just became a prison where time has no meaning. Hart writes that based on his data, if you’re a man who hears those five words, you should just call up your friends and tell them you’ll see them tomorrow.

Absolutely amazing. In an era when most news outlets seem focused on getting clicks with puff-piece journalism, you’ve got to give it up to Kevin Hart and The New York Times for putting in the work to alert the world to the harsh truth that when your girlfriend or wife says she’s going to put on her makeup, she might as well have told you she was about to do a 10,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.

Exciting: The Surgeon General Is Holding A Lottery To Exempt One Lucky Pregnant Woman From His Smoking Warning,"If you’re an expectant mother, get excited, because here’s an incredible new opportunity that could make your pregnancy a lot more fun: The U.S. surgeon general just announced that he is holding a lottery to exempt one lucky pregnant woman from his smoking warning.
Awesome!
Starting today, pregnant women can enter the lottery by submitting their name and contact information to the Department of Health, where the winner, selected at random by U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams, will receive total exemption from the pregnancy-related health warnings included on tobacco products sold in the United States. The winner will be officially granted permission to ignore any language on cigarette labels about risks that smoking poses to unborn children, such as low birth weight, congenital heart problems, and birth defects, allowing her to smoke as much as she wants, guilt-free, until giving birth.

“As the U.S. surgeon general, I will turn a blind eye to the winner’s tobacco use throughout the duration of her pregnancy and allow her to smoke as much as she sees fit, completely exempting her from my public health warnings,” announced Surgeon General Adams in a press release. “For all I care, the winner can puff through a carton of Marlboros every single day right up to her due date. I won’t say a word. Despite urging every other American to consider the health hazards of smoking while pregnant, I will not pass any judgment on the winner for smoking, no matter what trimester they are in or what happens to their pregnancy as a result of their nicotine intake. Enter now!”
Cool!
With 3.3 million women currently carrying a child in the U.S., the odds of winning the sweepstakes are definitely small, but hey, you never know! Each woman has an equal chance of having her name drawn, so if you’re pregnant, you might as well throw your name in the hat and try your luck, because this is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

"Righting
Wrongs: Subway’s New Spokesperson Is A Man Who Gained 300 Pounds Eating Its Sandwiches And Also Has No Plans To Act On His Lust For Children","Subway has long been recovering from the PR nightmare of Jared Fogle being unmasked as a pedophile, but it looks like now it’s finally turning a corner. Today the restaurant chain took a huge step in the right direction by introducing a new spokesperson who gained 300 pounds eating its sandwiches and will also never act on his lust for young children.
By hiring what appears to be the polar opposite of Jared Fogle, Subway is showing that it’s definitely serious about righting past wrongs.

Making his debut appearance in a commercial that will air nationwide starting today, the new enormous spokesman holds up a pair of his old small pants that are now far too tiny for him to wear and says, “Hi, Subway sandwiches made me gain 300 pounds, and I have never molested a child. Eating 12 inches of bread, cheese, and meat every meal has caused me to become morbidly obese, and I only seek out pornography featuring performers who are a minimum of 18 years old. Thank you.” The spokesman then shows the camera some magazines from his pornography collection to prove he isn’t lying.
Wow, what a powerful message—and one that’s definitely going to win back customers’ trust.
“We’re pleased to start featuring a new spokesperson in our commercials, an inspirational Subway customer who really ballooned up thanks to our food, who has also vowed to never indulge in statutory rape or human trafficking,” announced Subway in a press release. “He used to be very thin until he started to Eat Fresh™ and now he weighs nearly 500 pounds thanks to Subway favorites like our Meatball Marinara or Cold Cut Combo. Additionally, while he would very much like to have sex with minors, he has absolutely no intention of acting on those urges. We’re ready to atone for past mistakes, and we hope you’ll see this new spokesman as proof of that.”

Subway received a major PR black eye with the whole Fogle fiasco, but this new fat spokesperson who never acts on his latent pedophilia is a big sign that the restaurant chain is redeeming itself and moving in a better direction.

What The Hell: This Kid Didn’t Dry Off From The Pool Before Sticking His Hand Into The Doritos Bag And Now Everyone Else Has To Eat Wet Doritos,"Well, this is pretty fucking annoying. If you’re at Austin Tinsley’s birthday pool party right now you might want to exercise caution near the snack table, because some kid didn’t dry off from the pool before sticking his hand into the Doritos bag and now everyone else has to eat wet Doritos. 
C’mon, kid, really? This is truly indefensible.
Just moments ago, while most of the partygoers were preoccupied trying to capture a slo-mo iPhone video of a really big seventh grader doing a belly flop, 11-year-old Xavier Brooks—perhaps the least popular kid in attendance—opted to get out of the pool and check out the snack situation, even though Austin’s mom explicitly said to wait on eating until she’d grilled enough Bubba Burgers for everyone. Dripping-wet and still wearing his goggles, Xavier then proceeded to open a brand-new family-size bag of Cool Ranch Doritos and basically stick his whole arm in there, making no effort to even towel his hands off before rooting around and helping himself to a fistful of chips, a reckless and unconscionable act that left the rest of the chips completely covered with pool water.

With only one bag of Doritos for the whole party to share, Xavier’s selfish, inconsiderate actions have now guaranteed that everyone else’s Doritos will be soggy and chlorine-flavored, which is especially infuriating because Austin’s mom really phoned it in on the snack situation and the only other snack option is carrot sticks and blue-cheese dip.
This child is officially a piece of shit.
Of course, a dick move like this should really be no surprise coming from Xavier, whose ignorance of basic pool etiquette has been plainly evident from the moment he showed up to the party wearing basketball shorts with boxers underneath instead of swim trunks. This is the kid who for the entire party has been shamelessly hoarding all four pool noodles so he can float on top of them like a hammock, and who accidentally kneed Mackenzie Jacobs in the head while diving for those little colored rings at the bottom of the pool. Neglecting to towel off before digging into the Doritos was typical for an irredeemable monster like Xavier, and chances are he’ll commit even more unforgivable acts before the party moves inside for cake and ice cream.

The damage that Xavier has already done to this party can never be undone, and nothing can fix the fact that the Doritos are gross and wet. All we can hope for now is that Xavier’s dad will come pick him up before he messes up anything else.",NaN,2018-10-22T10:34:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Pp4hy4al--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/jy3d7cgxtflgn73s1r0r.jpg",Fake
"""Tony Drank O.J. Right Out Of The Carton Like A Sicko"": An Oral History of ‘The Sopranos’ ","In 1999, David Chase was a virtually unknown screenwriter who had toiled in network development for years with little more than a few credits to show for it. Meanwhile, as major Hollywood studios continued to churn out blockbuster after blockbuster that made more money than was even thought possible just a few years earlier, television had been relegated to a mere stepping stone to feature lengths, and the medium was in the midst of a full-blown identity crisis of its own.
Only eight years later, David Chase would be universally regarded as the mastermind who elevated television to its highest form, ushered in an entire generation of prestige TV, and forever changed what was thought artistically possible on the small screen. This is the story of how TV’s biggest underdog became its long-awaited savior. This is the story of how the family saga of a New Jersey mob changed the world. This is the oral history of The Sopranos.

David Chase (series creator): By 1999, I had already spent over 30 years in Hollywood trying to get the stink off my name from my very first writing job: the 1977 Halloween episode of Happy Days. I made a mistake on that one by writing a script where the Fonz gets hit by more than one car in a single episode. Audiences hated it, and it really damaged my career.
Brad Grey (executive producer): I didn’t know a David Chase in ’99. No one did. But everyone in Hollywood had heard of “The Fonzarelli Sadist.” He was the bald wiry fuck who wrote the Happy Days episode where the Fonz is hit by four separate cars in a mere 22-minute broadcast. You’d hear him described around town constantly, like, “Did you hear? The Fonz Sadist who tortured Fonzie in that shit Halloween episode is desperately sliding treatments under every strip mall door in the town—Rite Aids, Hallmark stores, you name it,” or, “The sad-looking Fonz Sadist who graphically showed Fonzie getting run over by a car four times tried getting a gig writing the entrée descriptions for the Perkins menu but couldn’t even do that.” He was roasted a ton, but his actual name wasn’t mentioned much, really.
Matthew Weiner (writer): I only knew David Chase as the guy who made my parents cry by showing the Fonz get run over with a car after basically every commercial in that one Happy Days episode. What a mess that was. It was supposed to be a Halloween episode, but there was nothing Halloween-ish about it. They hammered home that it was set in April because everyone kept saying, “April showers bring May flowers,” and the plot was essentially the same as it was in the prior week’s episode, something about Potsie growing his hair out. The only real difference was that it had four way-too-long scenes of Fonzie underneath a car tire, yelping, “I prayed that this wouldn’t happen and it happened anyway!” while the rest of the characters quietly looked at their feet because they knew they didn’t have the guts to put him out of his misery. It took the Happy Days writers years to regain the audience’s trust after that, and David was pretty much blackballed ever since.

David Chase (series creator): I honestly thought people would be glad to see how well the Fonz handled getting hit by four cars. I thought audiences would be excited to learn he can’t die that way. I misread it.
Terence Winter (writer and executive producer): By 1999, my career was going pretty well. I’d written on a handful of successful shows and was dabbling in producing a little, too. But years earlier, I’d made a deal with David Chase when he was at his lowest. I saw the Fonz Sadist walking out of a Potbelly Sandwich Shop carrying a plastic bag, and I told him, “If you give me those leftovers, I promise to write on any show you ever get into development.” Of course I never thought he’d actually get a show on the air. I would have bet my house that he’d be out of the business by the end of the month. At that time, I thought I was simply stealing leftovers from a depressed man. But years later, David had his beautiful Sopranos revelation, and I’ve been grateful every day since for developing a habit of scamming the saddest sacks I could find. 
David Chase (series creator): I was at the end of my rope and I knew it. I spent years trying to backtrack on my initial impulse toward rawness and realness in Happy Days and show people that I can write upbeat, viewer-friendly things, too. I pitched a show about cartoon birds who were siblings and proudly best friends with each other. I wrote a show about cartoon dolphins who were all sisters and adults and still lived together because they just liked it. I wrote one about animated penguin brothers who always said, “I love you,” to each other before they hung up the phone. And it all got me nowhere. Finally, I put my foot down and decided that if I’m going to fail, then I’m going to fail pitching what’s in my heart. I thought, I’m a Jersey kid. I’m Italian. I know what story I have to tell. So I set up one last pitch meeting at HBO.

Chris Albrecht (president of HBO original programming): The Fonz Sadist stormed into my office without an appointment and announced, “Together we’re going to make a show about the architects who design X Games ramps. How they come up with it, how they make everything so smooth, that sort of thing. Those guys gotta be a trip.” 
Richard Plepler (co-president of HBO): We of course said no right away, and the guy kind of started crying almost. Then he scrambled for his notepad, started flipping through it, and said, “Wait, fuck. Hold on. What if it’s about Tony Soprano being mean to all of his friends?” and we said, “Honestly, that sounds fine.”
David Chase (series creator): Once I got the green light on the Tony Soprano nonsense, I knew that this was my one chance to turn things around and redeem myself in the eyes of the world. I wouldn’t have to be “The Fonz Sadist” anymore. I could finally get a nice nickname like “The Young Toni Iommi” maybe. This was my chance to make something special and completely change the game.

David Chase finally got the green light for the project he’d waited decades to make, but the work was only just beginning. If The Sopranos was going to be the genre-busting masterpiece he envisioned, he’d need to find the perfect leading man to star as the show’s brooding antihero, and the perfect cast to support him. 
David Chase (series creator): I knew right away that this wasn’t going to be your glamorous, run-of-the-mill Hollywood mafia story. This was going to be a story about what it means to be human, so even if audiences didn’t know anything about the mafia, they could still relate to Tony’s every-man struggle of wondering if your therapist likes you or thinks you’re a piece of shit. With that vision in mind, I knew that I needed an average Joe to play Tony. I didn’t want some jaded Hollywood hot shot like Robert De Niro or Al Pacino.
Terence Winter (writer and executive producer): De Niro and Pacino were so high on David’s list for playing Tony Soprano that it was kind of pathetic. He idolized those guys. He called them “The Godbrothers,” and he had director chairs made with their names stitched on the back part even though neither of them had agreed to be in the show. David was using those chairs in his apartment as dining room chairs until filming began. Said he was “keeping them warm for them” until one agreed to be Tony Soprano. It wasn’t until he met with them that he got it through his head that they weren’t taking the role.

Brad Grey (executive producer): David invited Robert De Niro and Al Pacino to the same dinner meeting without telling them that the other one would be there, kind of like a Parent Trap situation. He got to the restaurant first and sat there at the table with his shit-eating grin, really believing that he was about to watch two of the most legendary actors alive fight over which one got to play Tony Soprano, a character who at that point was essentially a live-action Fred Flintstone who ate lunch meat right out of the fridge sometimes.
Terence Winter (writer and executive producer): De Niro and Pacino arrive and instead of being angry that they were both invited to the same meeting, they’re so excited to see each other because they’re friends, and they go on to talk for the entire meal as if David wasn’t even there. It was humiliating. The dudes were having a full-blown “remember when” conversation about shooting Heat back in ’95, laughing and clapping each other on the back, all while David’s just sitting there, totally unable to hop in the conversation.
Brad Grey (executive producer): The only thing David got the chance to mention about the Tony Soprano role was when, during a brief moment when De Niro and Pacino had stopped laughing with each other, he muttered, “Tony Soprano owns a strip joint, could be cool.” De Niro and Pacino both responded by slamming their hands down on the table and telling him to shut the fuck up because they hated when people called them “strip joints.” David got so red, and pretty much saw that they were out of the project.

David Chase (series creator): Once I made the decision that Tony Soprano had to be an unknown actor, I started asking around for names of actors who could handle what I was imagining, and it was a tall order. I needed someone authentically Jersey enough to know how to avoid touching the hand of the gas attendant who just filled up his tank when getting his debit card back, but a good enough actor to make it seem like he wasn’t purposefully avoiding the guy’s gas-hand or anything. And the more I asked around, the more people recommended a guy named James Gandolfini.
Ilene S. Landress (executive producer): At that time, James Gandolfini was making a lot of noise on Broadway, and for what David had in mind, he seemed to be a perfect fit. He was raw and talented, crushing in plays like, Beating The Shit Out Of My One Friend And I Forget Why, There’s Only One Ponytail And It Belongs To Furio, and The Priest And My Wife: Might’ve Been Something Going On There But It’s Boring. It was a match made in heaven. 
Terence Winter (writer and executive producer): We went to watch him perform one night, and the depth he showed as an actor was like nothing I’d ever seen. It was a production of Cats, and there he was onstage, all dressed up like a big hairy cat. On paper, his role was meant to be a very quiet, background character, but James was able to add incredible layers and completely stole the show. On the outside, he seemed like he was having a fine time dancing around like a cat, but underneath, you could tell that he was furious about how dumb he looked, a grown-ass man who has to pretend he’s a cat, licking his hand sometimes and getting down on all fours every now and then to lap milk out of a bowl like an absolute jackass. David loved that duality and approached James after the show with an offer.

James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) [from 2010 Vanity Fair interview]: I was acting in a production of Cats back in ’99, and after the final show of our run, David Chase approached me. He said, “You can’t be a cat if you’re Tony Soprano,” while smirking and reaching his hand out to shake mine as if we just closed some kind of deal. I didn’t say anything for a good 10, 15 seconds, and then he nervously started explaining more. He said, “You’re Tony Soprano, you big lug, and that’s final. I’ll give you health insurance and two director chairs that each say ‘The Godbrothers.’ Please do this for me.” I didn’t have a next gig lined up, so I said sure. 
Ilene S. Landress (executive producer): We felt great once we locked James up, and casting from there on out was pretty much a breeze. David took the next three weeks off because he thought the hard part was over and he wanted to take some time to learn how to play guitar, which he insisted he could do in that short amount of time. He went to Italy to take guitar lessons and he left the casting to us. His only instruction was, “If you cast any other part with an actor who looks exactly like James Gandolfini, it will be so confusing for everyone and I’ll fucking kill you.”
Michael Imperioli (Christopher Moltisanti): The HBO people were impressed by my performance in Goodfellas because of how my kind-of unibrow made me look very different from James Gandolfini, so I was basically a shoo-in. The audition was more of a formality than anything, but it was a blast. I read the scene from the pilot where Christopher is just getting home after being dishonorably discharged from the military for complaining it was too hot out, and the writing was like something I’d never seen before. I got the part and knew we had something special going.

Edie Falco (Carmela Soprano): Getting cast in The Sopranos was a total walk in the park for me. I got the part after doing an audition on my cell phone while sitting in an abs machine at a Planet Fitness. The casting people rang me up and asked me to describe what I looked like in a general way so they knew I didn’t look similar to a plump, middle-aged bald man, so I started breaking it down. “Woman, yellow hair, long fingernails that click-clack on counters and tables.” That’s when they stopped me, said congratulations, and that they’d see me on Monday. Everyone at the gym was annoyed that I was talking on the phone without being in the lobby, but I didn’t care. I was too excited to find out who I just talked to, and what job I got.
Robert Iler (A.J. Soprano): I was 14 back in 1999, and all I wanted was to become an actor so people around school would know me as the kid from TV instead of the kid who cried when they showed us the puberty education video because it scared me, but I thought that ship had sailed. I had auditioned for Harry Potter And The Sorcerer’s Stone to play one of the two interchangeable husky kids who follow Malfoy around and laugh at his zingers about how Harry’s family is one of those families whose house smells too much like their dog, but they turned me down. I was devastated. Then, out of nowhere, I got a call from HBO about playing A.J. Soprano on the basis that I’m too small to look anything like James Gandolfini. It was one of the best moments of my life.
Steven Van Zandt (Silvio Dante): I got cast in The Sopranos during an interesting time in my life. I had been the guitarist in Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band for over 30 years, but was just fired for breaking the band’s “no side projects” rule because I laid down the title screen music for that RollerCoaster Tycoon game on computers. I somehow got it in my head that RollerCoaster Tycoon was going to become what Facebook eventually became and make me a billionaire, and that mistake almost ruined my life. I was devastated when Bruce fired me, but I soon realized that it was a great opportunity for me to pursue a career that I was always interested but never had time for.

Brad Grey (executive producer): When we found out that Steven Van Zandt was working as a substitute CPR dummy at his local YMCA for people who wanted to learn CPR but were weirded out by the way CPR dummies have no body hair and feel kind of like those soft dodgeballs from gym class, we knew we had to ask him to get involved with The Sopranos. We thought his look would be perfect for the show, and after we agreed to let him do his CPR thing on set if anyone wanted to take him up on it, he miraculously agreed to come on board. We couldn’t believe our luck. Everything was breaking our way, and you could feel the excitement around the whole project. 
James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) [cont. from 2010 Vanity Fair interview]: We had pretty standard toilets on the set of The Sopranos. Definitely didn’t have the sinks on the top part like the toilets in prisons or anything. But we had fun anyway, especially in the early days. It felt like we knew we were about to do something big.
David Chase (series creator): When I came back from Italy after three of the most frustrating weeks of my life, I was miserable. My fingers hurt like hell, I’d spent over $800 on guitar equipment that I couldn’t return because the store said I sweated too much into all the AUX outlets, and I was ashamed because I was telling everyone that I successfully learned to play guitar in just three weeks, even though I was absolute trash. But when I got wind of the cast that we lined up while I was gone, my mood did a total 180. No other actor looked exactly like James Gandolfini, and everyone was good, too. That first year, we were all focused on making something that we were proud of, and we hoped that people would respond to it. But we never could have foreseen just how big that response would be.

Before the end of the first season, audiences had spoken: The Sopranos was the biggest show on television and was already becoming a worldwide phenomenon. From every corner of the world, millions of viewers tuned in on Sunday nights to catch up on the Soprano family drama. Meanwhile, a group of mostly unknown actors had suddenly become global icons, and some handled the adjustment better than others. 
Brad Grey (executive producer): There were a million reasons why this show shouldn’t have appealed to people. Barely any characters said cool shit like “Hoochie mama!” The show had some detectives but none of them had those detective hats, which was annoying. Tony drank O.J. right out of the carton like a sicko. But lo and behold, audiences were hooked right away, and it was all thanks to the storyline about Tony seeking therapy because of how much he was passing out. People couldn’t stop talking about it. 
Matthew Weiner (writer): It’s common now with shows like Westworld and Game Of Thrones, but The Sopranos was the first show that fans theorized about together week to week, and the first big riddle that they tried solving was “Why is Tony passing out?” Everywhere you went, you overheard people piecing the clues together: “I believe Tony is passing out because he’s thinking about the robots with guns for breasts from Austin Powers, and the mix of horniness and fear is too much for his legs to handle,” or, “I think Tony is passing out because he’s thinking about the robots with guns for breasts from Austin Powers, and his desire to capture one and program it to collect money from gamblers is making him so excited that he gets weak in the legs.”

David Chase (series creator): A lot of what I wrote about in The Sopranos came out of my own frustrations with the way TV refused to show what real life was like. I remember thinking, “I pass out almost every single day, and I don’t know if it’s because I’m horny for the robots with guns for breasts from Austin Powers, or if it’s because I’d like to use their power for my own gain. So why isn’t anyone showing that on TV?” So I got to writing, and people responded to it in a big way. That storyline catapulted us to number one, and rocketed our cast to mega-stardom overnight.
Michael Imperioli (Christopher Moltisanti): The level of fame we were dealing with at that time was insane. Within the first few weeks of the show being on, you couldn’t watch an NFL game without seeing a player getting knocked unconscious and then, as the paramedics made their way onto the field, hear the announcers say something like, “I don’t care that this player is dead or what. Don’t even tell me honestly. All I’m thinking about today is whether Christopher Moltisanti has to go to the barber, or if he’s making enough cash with Tony that the barber comes to him, and maybe cuts his hair in the yard or on the porch so he doesn’t get hair all in his living room. That’d be fucking awesome.”
Edie Falco (Carmela Soprano): I can remember going to confession at my church, the same church I’d gone to all my life, and the vibe was suddenly different. When the priest recognized it was me on the other side of the confessional booth, he’d say, “Wait, pause. Hold on.” Then he’d lead me out to the parking lot, and we’d do the confession sitting in his car. He’d turn all the air conditioner vents toward me so I was very comfortable, and after every sin I confessed, he’d try making me feel better about it by confessing to me that he killed a civilian during the Korean War just because. I told him he didn’t have to do all that for me, but all he would say is, “Anything for Carmela Soprano.” The special treatment we got was just crazy.

Steven Van Zandt (Silvio Dante): Bruce Springsteen showed up to my house in the night and was throwing some pebbles at my window. I opened it and saw that he was holding a computer monitor with the RollerCoaster Tycoon home screen on it over his head, and it was blasting the music I wrote. He yelled up, “I changed my mind. I love how this sounds like the music playing at the worst mini-golf course on the boardwalk. If you come back to the E Street Band, you can make as much mini-golf music as you want.” I couldn’t believe it. I mean, this was the same guy who fired me from the band a year earlier and replaced me with an old car stereo that had the bass blown out so you could only really hear the guitar parts, but now that I was on The Sopranos, I was a hot commodity. And I’ll tell you, I took great pleasure in telling him, “Sorry pal, but I’m a substitute CPR dummy now who pats CPR students on the back to encourage them while they practice resuscitating me, and I’m on The Sopranos for money.” 
Robert Iler (A.J. Soprano): Once the show took off, going back to school in between seasons was crazy. Before I was on The Sopranos, I was known in my grade as the kid who cried when they showed us the puberty education video because change scares me, but when I came back from The Sopranos, the entire school suddenly knew me as the seventh-grader who never learned how to read because he was too busy acting.
David Chase (series creator): Most of the cast handled being in the spotlight really well. It seemed fun for them, but for me, success was a mixed bag. Sure, people started forgetting about the Fonzie stuff, so my dentist was allowing me to spit in the little sink attached to the dentist chair again instead of always making me swallow whatever excess shit was in my mouth because he hated me. But on the other hand, everyone suddenly had put me on a pedestal as some kind of important artist, and that came with a lot of pressure.

Terence Winter (writer and executive producer): I was once at the airport with David heading to a conference and a woman said over the entire airport intercom, “Tony Soprano does not like water slides. He’s a sensitive guy and can feel the bolts and cracks in between plastic slabs on the slide, and it kind of hurts his back. So it would never make sense for Tony to die on a water slide. Christopher, definitely. But not Tony. David Chase, if you make Tony die on a waterslide and betray his character, there will be consequences,” and then 10 loud gun shots. There was a lot of pressure on him to not ruin a thing everyone loved.
Ilene S. Landress (executive producer): James was another one who never seemed to relish the spotlight. No matter how much praise he got for his performance, something always seemed to be missing for him. 
James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) [cont. from 2010 Vanity Fair interview]: Things were good with those toilets on set overall, no doubt. I knew that I was very lucky. But, at the same time, it was deeply frustrating that I couldn’t lie down immediately after using the toilet, the way I’d be able to if my toilet were in my bedroom like in jail. But that’s life, I guess. Sometimes the best toilets are in the worst places.

Through six thrilling seasons, The Sopranos threw out every traditional television convention in the book and proved that TV could be a platform without limitations. The show elevated a medium that had previously offered little more than sitcoms and the nightly news to its absolute peak, and the impact of The Sopranos would continue to be felt for years to come.
Alessandra Stanley (critic, The New York Times): The Sopranos changed the game in too many ways to count, but to me, its biggest accomplishment was giving TV permission to take itself seriously. The Sopranos’ commitment to reality was next-level. I mean, the show was so close to life that real Jersey mobsters were reaching out to the writers to ask how they knew all of these accurate details, and the writers would fuck with them and say, “You confessed all of this stuff to us at our house,” and the mobsters would get all nervous and say, “You’re fucking with us,” and the writers would say, “No, you confessed all of your crimes to us and asked us to put it on TV and tell the police. Are you okay? How don’t you remember?” And the mobsters would get all freaked out and cry. That kind of thing just wasn’t happening before.
Terence Winter (writer and executive producer): I think the thing I’m most proud of is Tony’s antihero character. Before Tony, everyone on TV was a good guy or a bad guy, no in between. The closest thing TV had was Mr. Feeny in Boy Meets World, who was usually a sweet old man but every now and then would go too far with his razzing after he drank too much coffee and make fun of Shawn Hunter for being too poor to afford braces. But Tony was complex all the time.

Tom Shales (critic, The Washington Post): Before The Sopranos, every episode of TV ended with a little lesson to learn, all wrapped up in a bow for the audience. There was always a purpose and a reason for everything that happened. But life isn’t like that. Life is more like one of Tony’s dreams, where Tony is a wizard who has every power imaginable except the ability to morph Christopher back into a human after he becomes a horse. The whole time, Christopher is saying, “T, please help, goddamn Ton, being a horse sucks, my eyes are all the way on the sides of my head basically right under my ears and it’s giving me a headache because it’s hard to focus my eyes on shit,” and Tony is riddled with guilt because it’s out of his hands until he wakes up and instantly forgets the whole thing. The Sopranos showed that you can try to interpret things all you want, but most of the time, life doesn’t mean anything. It’s just a series of things that are interesting to look at. 
David Chase (series creator): It amazes me that people are still trying to decipher deeper, hidden meanings in the show, with questions like, “Is Tony’s tragic character arc a metaphor for American imperialism?” or, “Does the ambiguous ending represent America’s murky morality in the 21st century?” It’s flattering, but I almost never get involved in those conversations because I’m never invited to them, and I don’t know where they’re happening. But if anyone ever wants to come by and shoot the shit about that stuff, I could probably modify my opinions about what I wanted The Sopranos to mean according to what I think you’d like to hear, or whatever really. I got nothing on the docket most days.

"Adorable! This Elderly Couple Is Celebrating 75 Years Of On Again, Off Again Bullshit","Get ready for a heartwarming love story  that’s definitely going to make your day: This elderly couple is celebrating 75 years of on again, off again bullshit!
This is seriously too cute! Can you say relationship goals?
Ever since they first started dating all the way back in the 1940s, Philadelphia residents Regina Lee and Max Sellers have been doing that super annoying thing where they break up every three months and no one close to them ever really knows what their deal is. Through World War II, the civil rights movement, and more than a dozen presidencies, this couple has never stopped shocking their friends by showing up to parties together right after they’d told everyone that they’d ended things for good—that’s just how sweet they are!

Plus, Regina and Max have kept every letter they’ve written each other over the past seven decades, from notes handwritten in the ’60s that say, “I hope I never see your fucking face again,” to Facebook messages sent last year on iPhones like, “Delete my number because this is the last time we’re ever going to speak—unless you’re ready to apologize.” Yep, for the last 75 years, this amazing couple has never gone more than a few good weeks before having a big fight that ends in a decision to see other people until they inevitably hook up a month later and start the whole goddamn thing all over again. Sooo adorable!!

Heartwarming! Locks Of Love Will Now Donate Hair To Middle-Aged Men Who Have Lost All The Hair On Their Legs From Wearing Dress Socks,"Grab some tissues, because here’s a story about an amazing new charitable initiative that will definitely bring a tear to your eye: Locks Of Love has announced that it will now also donate hair to middle-aged men who have lost all the hair on their legs from wearing dress socks.
Beautiful!
Hair donors can now feel even better about their contributions to Locks Of Love knowing that their gift will  help not only children who’ve lost their hair due to medical conditions, but also men in their 40s and 50s who have completely smooth calves and ankles after years of friction from dress socks. Businessmen who, out of embarrassment, have resorted to wearing slacks year-round to hide their hairlessness can now have a second chance at leading a normal life with thick, bristly leg hair, making them feel confident and youthful once again.

“Locks Of Love is proud to begin bringing hope into the lives of bankers, lawyers, and other corporate types whose legs have become totally bald from regularly wearing dress socks,” said the nonprofit in a press release. “We want to return a sense of happiness and normalcy to adult men whose legs have become smooth as a cue ball from decades of wearing high dress socks.”
Wow. If that doesn’t warm your heart, nothing will.
If you want to change a middle-aged man’s life forever by giving your hair to his legs, Locks Of Love is always accepting donations and would definitely appreciate your support. Kudos to this one-of-a-kind charity for doing so much to make the world a better place.

Her Magnum Opus: Mom Put A 27-Photo Album On Facebook Of Just Last Night’s Dinner,"There’s nothing quite like witnessing the creative peak of an artist in their prime, and this newly released masterpiece is no exception: Mom has put a 27-photo album on Facebook of just last night’s dinner.
Just fantastic. A work like this is unprecedented—though not entirely unexpected—from someone as prolific as Mom.
Advertisement

The album, which Mom released in two identical editions, one titled “family Dinner [sic]” and the other more abstractly titled “Uploaded From iOS,” featured a wide range of styles and subjects, from a series of five close-up pictures of Dad all taken within the same three-second span, to a still life of the pork tenderloin Mom cooked that was shot in grayscale, a confounding yet undeniably bold artistic choice. Even more fascinating was Mom’s decision to caption only three of the photos from the middle of the album, all of which were photos of herself blinking with the label “So great to have everyone together.”
Mom was clearly blessed by the Muses last night, and we should consider ourselves lucky to see the fruits of her experimental energy.
Arguably the crown jewel of the piece was the album’s 10 candid shots of all three siblings crowded around a single chair, almost completely obscured by several two-liter bottles of Diet Coke on the table. Though the album focused on last night’s at-home family dinner, it came to a fascinating conclusion with three photos that seem to have been taken months prior, featuring Mom’s friend Jeanne trying on a skirt to see how it fit. Further, despite only posting the album on Facebook, where hashtags are rarely used, Mom’s singular sensibility led her to ingeniously subvert her viewers’ expectations by adorning the post with #DinnerWithFam and #FunDinner.

It is easy to understand why Mom is proud, because anyone who sees this album will recognize it as one of her most fully realized creations.
Since she posted it at 7:50 this morning, Mom’s album has already garnered widespread acclaim, receiving a comment from her college friend Herb who said “Wow,” and from her sister, who was provoked by the work to ask “When is Kyle’s graduation party going to be this year? Xo Dana.” The far-away photo of the fully set dinner table that Mom took from the doorframe of the next room was especially a breakout hit, as evidenced by effusive comments such as “enjoy,”  “enjoy yourself,” and “Love to see this family!” 
Simply perfection. What an incredible exhibition from Mom at the apex of her creative output. We can’t wait to see what she posts next!

"If Any Autistic Kids Are Tryna Go To Prom With Me, I’d Be More Than Happy To Do That Shit (By Logan Paul)","Yo, for real? All over the world, there are people with fucked-up problems about them. It especially bums me out when I see kids with disorders and diseases so wild n’ out that they’re unable to grow up living a Maverick lifestyle, like myself and millions of my fans in the Logang do. This is why I want to give back, and use my platform (“Logan Paul Vlogs” on YouTube, smash that subscribe button) to bring some joy into their lives. So, if any autistic kids are tryna go to prom with me, I’d be more than happy to do that shit.
You got autism and no prom date? Say no more, fam. I’m down with you having autism, and I’m game to go to prom with you and snap some pics, throw ’em on my socials, whatever.

Ayo, lemme get real with you for a minute. When you’re an internet mega-star with the fastest growing YouTube channel, millions of dollars in merch money (loganpaul.com/shop), and a P.R. team with dope-ass ideas like this one, you gotta remember that there are people in the world who don’t have as much as you, and on top of that, they got autism too. I wouldn’t be where I am today without my fans, and of course, that means all the autistic Logangsters out there too. The least I could do is show up to an autistic Logang Pauler’s house on prom night with my whole film crew, Tokyo drift up to prom in my purple Bugatti—my new autistic amigo in the passenger seat yellin’ “skert skert”—and then throw that shit on my YouTube channel (Logan Paul Vlogs, like and subscribe, binch). You let me know, and I’m there. 
Let me help you win prom king or queen and throw that heartwarming shit online to rack a milli views, my autistic Logangringos.
Fam, this is real talk. I’m tryna show my autistic groupies such a good time at prom that all the non-autistic kids on the dance floor will wish they had some autism too. I’ll make it rain free Maverick socks and Logang swag (loganpaul.com/shop) on you and your whole autism crew on the dance floor. No expenses spared. That’s a Logan Paul promise to each and every kid who asked someone to prom only to be told “nah” because they are autistic.

Bro, I will literally cry tears in my eyes at the end of the night when I leave prom and I will personally thank you for teaching me so much shit about autism as I head home to do pranks with my friends back at my mansion. Yo, fam, I swear to God I’ll even use my autistic prom date in a signature Logan Paul prank, just like the prank where I put my dwarf friend Evan in a suitcase and checked him on an airplane. I’m ready to use all the resources at my disposal to show the world that  Logan Paul is happy to use you in a prank, even if you are autistic, or small, or whatever issue you got going on. That’s what I’m all about.
Comment on literally any of my vids, “I am autistic and I gotta go to prom with Logan Paul,” and I’ll hop on a luxury private jet and fly to you, pronto. YUH, son!
Straight up, I’m gonna be real with you right now: Yeah, I’ve had some controversies, but I’ve grown. I’ve matured. Today, I sell merch to children as a better person than I was before (maverickbyloganpaul.com), and if I can raise autism awareness while slinging T-shirts and hoodies to Logang-bangers afflicted with that sad shit, I’m beyond open to it. After all, the mission of Logan Paul Vlogs (check that shii on YouTube) is to make the world a better place, which is why nothing would make me more hyped than to do a video where I slow-dance, dab, and grind on an autistic kid who no one wanted to go to prom with. The Maverick lifestyle wouldn’t mean anything if I didn’t make an autistic kid achieve viral immortality on the most poppin’ YouTube channel going (Logan Paul Vlogs, on YouTube, watch and subscribe, yeet yeet).

Yo, also, if my prom date dies of autism, I could make another daily vlog about how they changed my life. I got their back like that. That’s how hard I’m willing to ride for the autistic youngins who all love me so much.
Let me hit you with some real-ass truth right now: In the Logang, we don’t listen to the haters, we don’t listen to the naysayers, the doubters, the pouters. We listen to the millions of kids out there who spend prom night at home being autistic and watching my vids all alone—and we do something about it. Logan Paul got nothing but love for autism people, and to prove it I’ll take a bunch of ’em to prom, and I know you’ll be out there liking and subscribing to my channel (Logan Paul Vlogs, the one and only, check it out on YouTube.com) to let me know you’ve got love for me and my decision to go on a date with these autism people. Ight, I’m peacing outta this bitch. Don’t forget to check out my daily vlogs tomorrow (on YouTube.com, Logan Paul Vlogs, hottest channel in the game). 
Dab out, son!!!

Leading A Double Life: This Guy Who Seems Pretty Normal For The Most Part Also Knows A Ton About Local High School Football,"Sometimes in life, it’s the most ordinary and unassuming people who turn out to be anything but. This seems to be exactly the case for 32-year-old Jason Shepherd, who is a thoroughly normal guy in every regard except for one: He apparently knows a ton about local high school football and gets really into it.
Wow. Though Shepherd may appear completely average to the naked eye, it seems he also leads a shadowy second life.
Advertisement

While Shepherd might come across as a regular guy with an average job, healthy social life, and no obvious red flags, the truth is that he spends an inordinate amount of his free time watching and analyzing the varsity football team of his hometown, Catonsville West High School, attending each and every game with a scorebook and a headset tuned into the local radio broadcast. Though he has no relatives on the team or any personal connection to the school, Shepherd nonetheless begins tracking player scouting reports and online prep rankings months before the season even starts, dedicating as much fervor to the pursuit as typical football fans do their favorite NFL teams.
“Sometimes he’ll meet up with us at a bar on Friday nights and casually mention that he came straight from the Hilltoppers game as if it’s perfectly normal for a man in his 30s to spend his weekends watching teenage boys play sports,” says longtime friend Devin Simmons, noting that Shepherd will even go early to watch the JV games. “He goes to the games with a little thermos full of coffee and sits up in the bleachers with all the other old men who go to high school football games. He knows all the players’ names and can tell you which ones have a chance to make it to the NCAA, and he’ll sometimes reference articles from websites like MaxPreps as if they’re just normal ESPN articles or whatever.”
“It’s pretty weird,” he added.
Though friends insist that they don’t think Shepherd is a pedophile or anything like that, they remain perplexed as to how a respectable, socially competent man of his age with no mental health issues could be so passionately invested in a teenage sports league he has nothing to do with. Making matters even more confusing is the fact that Shepherd didn’t even play football himself back in high school, which would seem to be the only valid explanation for why a grown man would commit so much time and energy to such a bizarre hobby.

"Beautiful Act Of Solidarity: When His Zookeeper Started Chemo Treatments, This Amazing Chimpanzee Pissed In His Own Mouth And Chewed On A Head Of Lettuce","Here’s a heartwarming story that proves that heroes come in all shapes and sizes: When his zookeeper started chemo treatments, this amazing chimpanzee pissed in his own mouth and chewed on a head of lettuce.
Incredible. What a beautiful display of solidarity from this chimp to his cancer-stricken caretaker.

When Brett Allen arrived to work at the Saint Louis Zoo the weekend after starting chemotherapy, he was feeling alone and scared—so it was truly beautiful to see one of the chimpanzees under Brett’s care spraying piss onto his own face to let Brett know that he wasn’t fighting cancer alone. By grabbing a dirty head of lettuce off the ground in his enclosure and proceeding to smack his lips on leaf after leaf, the kind-hearted ape sent a clear message to Brett: I stand with you.
Just amazing. Animals possess a  capacity for empathy that is truly remarkable.
Brett has a long battle ahead as he faces several more rounds of chemotherapy to fight his disease. But every step of the way, this amazing chimp will be running back and forth in his cage, grabbing at ropes and making hooting noises right there with him. The next time Brett has to head into the hospital for a cancer treatment, the weight of his struggle will feel a little lighter knowing that his chimpanzee ally is back at the zoo, compassionately messing with his own genitals and flinging straw all over the place.

Simply beautiful. Battling cancer is a harrowing experience that can leave you feeling isolated and defeated, so anyone who’s gone through that fight will know how lucky Brett is to have this chimp smearing shit on his enclosure walls in solidarity with him.

Hell yes. Thinx has totally hit it out of the park with this one. We can’t wait to see what it does next!

Frantic Search: Dad Is Asking If Anyone Has Seen His Favorite Quiksilver Shirt That He Got From PacSun In 2007 That’s Made Of That Super Soft Material That You Can See His Nipples Through,"If there’s any chance you’ll be crossing Dad’s path today, you might want to brace yourself, because there’s currently an extremely volatile situation developing. Dad is asking everyone if they’ve seen his favorite Quiksilver shirt that he got at PacSun in 2007 that’s made of that crazy soft material that you can clearly see his nipples through.
Please be advised that Dad is desperate to find this shirt, and he is getting more frantic by the moment.
Advertisement

It was all smooth sailing at the house until around 5:30 this afternoon, when Dad was just getting home from work to grab a quick shower before heading back out to Uncle Paul’s birthday dinner at Bertucci’s. Knowing that Bertucci’s is nice but not so nice that he had to wear a button-up or anything, Dad was positive he’d be rolling up to dinner in his absolute favorite Quicksilver shirt that perfectly outlines the sideways-oval shape of his big, soft nipples, and wasted no time in jogging up the stairs to throw it on. 
But after a few seconds of irritatedly tossing around the contents of his T-shirt drawer, along with searching the rest of the dresser, the bathroom floor, and the area under his side of the bed where he sometimes kicks his dirty clothes by accident, it dawned on Dad that his signature nipple-blasting shirt was missing. He is now running around the house searching for it in a full-blown panic.
Visibly distraught, Dad briskly stormed back down the stairs, loudly asking anyone who might’ve been listening, “Where’s my lime green Quiksilver shirt? I wear it all the time, had it forever,” which didn’t garner a single response. Without slowing down, Dad headed right down the basement stairs to make a bee line toward the laundry area, praying that his 11-year-old, form-fitting tee was in one of the dirty baskets, all the while trying to convince himself that it would make sense since he just wore it to Uncle Eric’s fantasy basketball draft two days before. But when each dirty hamper proved to be another dead end, along with the space behind the washer where folded laundry sometimes falls if a stack gets too high, Dad began to become consumed with despair.

 After coming up from the basement empty-handed, Dad started getting a little confrontational, and when he walked by Mom in the living room he started accusing her of donating the shirt, to which she distantly replied, “You have to shower now if we’re still going to Bertucci’s,” without looking up from her magazine. 
Then Dad barged into Brett’s room and asked Brett to look through his dresser for him to see if the super soft PacSun classic maybe got mixed up with his clothes, prompting the 17-year-old to straight-up laugh in his face and say that if that old-ass tee that perfectly cupped Dad’s middle-aged breasts is gone, it’s for the best.
Damn. This search seems to be taking a pretty heavy toll on Dad, and his waking nightmare doesn’t look to be ending any time soon. Here’s hoping that Dad’s nipple-flaunting 2007 Quiksilver tee turns up, and if it doesn’t, that he can eventually learn to live without it.

‘It’s A Perfectly Good Name’: Dressbarn Just Announced That It’s Just Going To Keep Being Called That,"At a time when many brands are frantically trying to revamp their public images to stay afloat in today’s increasingly grim retail economy, one classic fixture of American malls seems to be sticking to its guns: Dressbarn has announced that it plans to just continue being called that.
Fair enough, Dressbarn. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!
Saying that “it’s a perfectly good name” and that it is very proud of it, the women’s clothing retailer released a statement earlier today affirming its commitment to the Dressbarn moniker, adding that it has served them well for over 50 years and that it’s still got a great ring to it. While marketing experts might argue that there are some issues with a fashion outlet name that inherently likens female shoppers to livestock, Dressbarn defended its branding as practical, timeless, and evocative of its style.

“It’s a great name because when consumers see the words ‘dress’ and ‘barn,’ they know exactly what to expect: a large indoor space where there are clothes for women,” said the company, noting that the only name that could possibly be more effective is “Dressstore,” but that might be a little too on the nose. “When women see competitor stores like Kohl’s and Lane Bryant, they become confused and upset because the names don’t give them any indication of what to expect inside. For all they know, they could be walking into a restaurant or a pornography theater. With a name like Dressbarn, there’s no ambiguity whatsoever, and our customers are thankful for that.” 
Wow! Kudos to Dressbarn for staying true to who it is.

The 4 Disgusting People Who Led Me To Abandon The Priesthood After My Hand Touched Their Tongue While Feeding Them A Communion Wafer,"After many years of faithfully serving the Lord in the priesthood, I’ve decided to relinquish my vows and leave the church. Touching the horrid mouths of these four grotesque parishioners while feeding them Communion wafers has simply left me too emotionally and spiritually traumatized to continue in my ministry. I’m so sorry.

When I saw this pitiful man hobbling toward the altar, licking his chapped lips in anticipation of receiving the Sacred Host, I had a feeling I was in for an unpleasant encounter. But I couldn’t have imagined just how unpleasant it would be. Standing before me with his mouth agape, I noticed a dead tooth jutting crookedly from his gum line, a repulsive yellow-brown incisor that smelled just as awful as it looked. It was a deeply upsetting sight to behold, but I nonetheless steeled my nerves, said “The Body of Christ,” and began extending a wafer toward his mouth.  Then, much to my horror, he suddenly lurched his head forward as if to meet me halfway, causing my hand to awkwardly mash against his open mouth. I felt his dead tooth graze against the back of my hand, followed by the terrible sensation of his dry, elderly tongue raking at my fingers, attempting to seize the wafer. It was one of the worst feelings I have ever experienced, as if the light of Christ within me had instantly gone dark, extinguished by a hot gust of the man’s sour, dead-tooth breath. It was a feeling that seemed like it should not be permissible in a world governed by a loving and compassionate God. It shook me.

Just one week after the troubling encounter with the dead-tooth fellow, I was delivering a homily and found myself being repeatedly distracted by the sound of a parishioner loudly chewing cut-up hot dogs that she’d brought from home in a Tupperware container. I assumed that the woman would eventually have her fill of hot dogs and stop with the audible chewing, but unfortunately she continued to chomp away at her hot dogs through the end of my homily and into the Communion portion of the service, approaching the altar with a mouthful of mashed-up processed meat and her Tupperware in hand. Before giving her Communion, I quietly waited for a moment to see if she would perhaps pause with the chewing or at the very least put her Tupperware in her purse, but she did neither, and instead tapped her foot impatiently, looking at me as if I were greatly inconveniencing her. Annoyed, I decided to get it over with and just place the wafer on her tongue. A mistake. In my haste, my hand not only grazed her tongue but came away speckled with little bits of wet hot-dog mush. It was disgusting. It made me feel dirty and angry and wronged. Why would God allow one of his faithful servants to endure such indignity? To have one’s hand splattered with hot-dog spittle, that is a cross that no man should ever have to bear. Once again, I was shaken.

This young gentleman had confessed to me before Mass that he’d committed the sin of learning to fellate his own penis, as his two broken arms precluded him from traditional methods of masturbation and, as he explained to me, “you can only dry-hump the couch so many times before it gets boring.” Honestly, at first I did not judge this young man for the extreme lengths to which he’d gone to satisfy his carnal impulses, but when I saw him approaching the altar to receive Communion, his eyes full of shame, I suddenly found myself judging him very hard. He had confided to me that he had recently used his tongue to “flick at [his] own cock hole,” and it saddened me greatly to have to place the Body of Christ on that very same tongue. And making matters worse, when placing the wafer in his mouth, for some reason my hand twitched a little and my knuckles made contact with his filthy tongue, causing me to gasp so loudly that it could be heard over the pipe organ.
At that moment, confusion and doubt washed over me. Why did this keep happening? Was God testing me? I didn’t join the clergy to touch the tongues of the wicked, to feel awful spit from awful mouths drying sticky on my hands. Was this really God’s plan for me? It couldn’t be. Right?

I have taken mission trips to the deepest jungles of South America, where flesh-eating diseases and poverty ravage villages of helpless people. I have comforted countless victims of unthinkable abuse and oppression. I have held the hands of terminally ill children in their final moments and felt the weight of their parents’ grief. But none of these experiences destroyed me quite like giving Communion to this middle-aged hippie woman. I will spare you the horrible details, but suffice to say that when her hideous mouth made contact with my hand, I truly felt that there was no higher power watching over us. There was no justice, and there was no mercy—we were alone in our suffering. My faith was rocked, and there in that grand cathedral, dressed like a fancy clown, performing a ridiculous ancient superstition where bread becomes flesh and the stupid find peace, I suddenly knew it was all a farce. It was all empty pageantry and false hope, and touching all these vile mouths was a meaningless charade.
Once I realized this, there was no going back. I have since turned in my collar, moved out of the rectory, and started a new life away from the church, where I’ll hopefully never have to touch another stranger’s mouth again.

Devastating: This Woman Spent Years Going To Doctor After Doctor Looking For A Diagnosis For Her Condition Before Finding Out She Had A 5-Foot-Long Sword Going Through Her Head,"We all want to believe that trusting in the medical establishment will keep us healthy and safe, but the sad fact is that sometimes an accurate diagnosis is harder to come by than we would like it to be. Such was the case for Michelle Daniels, who went years jumping from doctor to doctor and failing to diagnose her symptoms before finding out she had a 5-foot-long sword going through her head.
This story is absolutely heartbreaking. It’s sad to think of all the pain Michelle might not have had to go through had she been able to get her diagnosis sooner.

One day in 2013, Michelle, a 32-year-old teacher, woke up on what she thought would be a regular Monday  with an intense headache. After popping a few Advil and hoping the pain would go away, Michelle started noticing a strange combination of other symptoms—trouble sleeping, difficulty fitting through doors, unexplained bleeding, neck pain. Some doctors told Michelle she was experiencing trouble lifting her head due to Lyme disease, while others speculated that the cuts she got on her arms when she would try to braid her hair were rare symptoms of Crohn’s disease. 
It would be five long years of doctors’ offices and failed treatments before Michelle finally found out what was wrong with her. Yet just as she was giving up hope that doctors would ever be able to diagnose her condition, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic took an interest in her case, and after extensive testing he was able to give her the answers she was looking for: Her symptoms were stemming from a 5-foot-long broadsword rammed through her skull and brain.
For Michelle, putting a name to the mysterious condition she had been struggling with for years was a bittersweet moment. “It felt amazing to know that all the fatigue, all the migraines, all the metallic sounds I’d hear when I tried to brush my hair—they weren’t just figments of my imagination. They were because I had a huge sword in my head,” she explained. “Living with this enormous blade piercing my skull isn’t easy, but now that the doctors have finally figured out what was wrong with me, I can at least manage my condition by wrapping a big blanket around the blade to muffle the loud clanging sounds it makes whenever it bumps into something.”

While it’s sad that Michelle had to go through so much pain before getting her life-changing diagnosis, the silver lining is that now she is free to learn more about living with a massive sword in her head and she can find ways to live with it as best she can. Hopefully Michelle’s story can serve as a lesson that helps the medical community more easily recognize and diagnosis big swords jutting out of people’s skulls so that others can avoid this type of nightmare in the future!",NaN,2018-10-16T10:30:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--uKHUgrX2--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/nywaks3lvihuejpjc3ap.jpg",Fake

5 Enchanted Animals That Whimsically Dress Me Up Like Snow White Every Fucking Morning Even Though I Work At An Investment Bank And Obviously Can’t Show Up Dressed Like That,"Somehow a bunch of enchanted woodland animals get into my apartment every morning to dress me up like Snow White even though I’m an adult man who lives in Midtown fucking Manhattan and works as a risk methodology analyst at Deutsche Bank. I have to undo the whole goddamn outfit before work, and it’s ruining my chances at making a senior position. I’m starting to get worried that it will never end. These are the animals that are doing this to me for reasons unknown to me.

This flock of bluebirds flies into my living-room window to hoist a red, yellow, and blue dress onto me every single day. I don’t know where the hell they got a Snow White dress that fits me perfectly even though I’m 6-foot-1 and weigh 200 pounds, but they have one. I have an entire closet full of Brooks Brothers shirts that I buy for myself because those are obviously what I need to wear to my office so I don’t look like an absolute freak, but these birds seem to think they’re helping me out by fluttering into my bathroom and putting a puffy-ass dress on me after I shower. The other day I didn’t have time to get the whole thing off before work and had to run out the door with the bodice on. I wore a trench coat in the office all day even though lots of people gave me weird looks and I was sweating bullets. I wish the bluebirds could have seen me then, so they’d finally realize that whatever magic shit they have going on is not something I need in my life at all. It’s incredibly tough working at a fast-paced office like Deutsche every day, and they are making it much, much tougher for me.

At least twice in the past month I have tried to explain to this deer that I don’t need it to wake me up at 6 a.m. by dabbing bright red blush on my cheeks with a makeup brush it holds in its mouth, because I am a 36-year-old man who works in finance and am not interested in wearing any fucking makeup to do my job. I look like a complete idiot when I show up to important meetings with lipstick smudges that I failed to wipe off lining the corners of my mouth, but this deer will not let up. My boss commented that I had some glitter on my eyelid the other day, and I had to make up a whole story about having a 3-year-old daughter. I don’t know what the hell I’m going to do when he finds out that’s a lie, but that’s just one of a lot of fucking problems I’m dealing with right now. I don’t understand why this deer can’t just go put all this makeup on someone who could use it.

Don’t even get me started on the fucking chipmunk that ties a big-ass red bow in my hair every single day. On weekends I’ll leave the bow on for a couple hours just to humor him so he stops squeaking “Oh, how lovely you look!” at me while I’m trying to finish making my breakfast. He looks so happy when he puts it on, like he’s just done the nicest thing in the world for me. It should be adorable, the way he clasps both hands and gasps and his big eyes light up when the bow is in my hair, but it only infuriates me. I don’t understand why he doesn’t look around my closet full of exclusively black and khaki pants and take the hint that he’s got the wrong guy.

These mice sing me an annoying-ass song while they strap high heels onto my feet every morning—“Oh, beautiful princess / Put shoes on your feet / So that you can charm / Each new person you meet!” That stupid fucking melody is in my head all goddamn day while I’m trying to look at spreadsheets, and it’s driving me insane. When they’re finished they always tell me I will look “so stunning at the ball.” What? I just need to make it to Starbucks in time to get a coffee before work. I don’t need to look stunning at whatever goddamn “ball” they’re referring to. That should be obvious to them at this point, but they don’t seem to care.  I live in a high-rise with hundreds of other units, so I have no idea how they chose me out of anybody else in the city, but these mice need to fuck off right back to the woods where they came from before they cost me a promotion.

How the fuck is an owl like this living in New York City? And why the fuck does it think it’s allowed to fly right past my doorman and up to my apartment where it sits on my Vitamix and brushes my hair while I’m just trying to make a smoothie? Last week it followed me all the way to work, trying to braid my  hair the whole way. My hair is barely longer than a buzzcut, so you can imagine how painful this is. I couldn’t manage to get this owl away from me no matter how many times I whacked at it with my suitcase or tried to lose it in the subway. Out of desperation and being sleep-deprived over worrying about this shit, I gave up and went to work, and just prayed that my coworkers would ignore the owl. Well, I should’ve realized, but you can’t just fucking ignore a huge owl brushing your coworker’s hair in the middle of a financial office—especially when it’s smiling and humming like a human would, which may be cute in kids’ movies, but in real life, is utterly fucking terrifying.

Epic Clapback: Ariana Grande Has Responded To Online Trolls By Transforming Into A Sturdy Oak Tree That Can Neither See Nor Hear Their Taunts,"It seems like internet trolls are becoming more ruthless than ever these days, but one social media icon has found a truly epic way to block out  haters once and for all: Ariana Grande has responded to online trolls by transforming into a sturdy oak tree that can neither see nor hear their taunts! This is an absolutely epic clapback! Ari is totally showing the trolls who’s boss by taking the form of a wise and strong oak that has no interest in the petty word of man.
It all started earlier today when Ariana began receiving a torrent of online hate from sexist trolls following the news that she and her fiancé, Pete Davidson, had broken up. The pop superstar instantly fired back in a big way by opening her soul to mother earth and glowing bright green for four hours until the light faded and a strong oak tree stood where she once was, oblivious to all but the wind gently shaking her branches.

After several hours of futilely posting insults on Ariana’s Instagram while she stood completely still in the gentle breeze, unable to read or respond to a single one of them, the trolls realized that they had no choice but to back off and leave her alone!

The Power Of Teamwork: This Incredible Group Of 5-Year-Olds Came Together To Kill A Horse,"Here’s a story that once again demonstrates that virtually anything is possible through the power of teamwork: This incredible group of 5-year-olds came together to kill a horse.
Wow! What a truly remarkable feat!
When kindergartners from Hoover Elementary School arrived at a local petting zoo for a field trip earlier today, they quickly took to harassing the animals in the way that small children often do: yelling at the sheep, poking the pigs, and chasing around chickens with unbounded energy. It just seemed like kids being kids at first, but then something truly extraordinary happened. Six-year-old Evan Dunwell, noticing an old mare minding its own business over in the corner, suddenly shouted, “Let’s kill that horse!”—a proposition that all the other children were unanimously on board with, prompting them to immediately spring into action. With some of them working together to topple the horse, others tying a jump rope around its neck, and still more beating it with their lunch boxes, the amazing kids swiftly coordinated to incapacitate the half-ton animal. Although the horse certainly put up a valiant fight—bucking and shrieking and kicking any child that came near its hooves—the kids ultimately triumphed over the beast after about 20 minutes of battle, with the horse drawing its final breath as the kids wildly stabbed it over and over with the colored pencils their teacher had given them to draw in their workbooks.

Incredible!
And the teamwork didn’t end there. After the kids succeeded in killing the horse, they excitedly celebrated their achievement, jumping up and down on the dead animal’s enormous ribcage and chanting, “We killed the horse! We killed the horse!” They then decided to muster their collective strength and drag the horse down to a nearby creek to see if they could get it to float downstream, remaining unified and focused even as their teacher screamed for them to stop and threatened to give them frowny-face stickers on the Behavior Board back in their classroom.
Just phenomenal. If these kids can already do something as difficult and ambitious as killing a horse and dragging it to a creek while they’re still in kindergarten, then there’s really no limit on what they’ll be able to accomplish in the future. It just goes to show that if you work together and believe in yourselves, literally nothing is impossible.

"Absolutely Pathetic: Just 10 Minutes Into This Sleepover, This Boy Is Already Laying The Groundwork For Calling His Mom To Come Take Him Home Early","Eight-year-old Patrick Angstrom of Durham, NC just proved himself to be one of the weakest, most embarrassing human beings on Earth. Patrick is currently attending a sleepover at his friend’s house, and just 10 minutes in, Patrick is already laying the groundwork for calling his mom to take him home early.
Pathetic. Just absolutely pathetic.
From the moment Patrick arrived at his friend Max’s sleepover, this coward began planting the seeds for his mom to come pick him up before any of his friends had so much as unrolled a sleeping bag. The first thing that came out of his mouth upon entering the basement, where all his friends were already having a blast playing video games, was, “Oh no, I forgot my pillow and my toothbrush, they’re back at home,” as if Max’s mom didn’t have, like, 80 fucking pillows he could borrow. It’s completely obvious he just concocted that excuse so he wouldn’t have to be away from home for one big, long, scary night. 
Advertisement

 Seriously, it’s like he’s trying to dodge the fucking draft or something. While all of his friends are having a great time, he’s spending all of his time coming up with convoluted reasons to call his mom. What a waste of a sleepover invite.
Patrick’s desperate yearning to sleep in his own bed right down the hall from Mommy and Daddy is completely obvious to every single kid in his friend’s basement. One might think the arrival of three whole pepperoni pizzas and renting Solo: A Star Wars Story on-demand would be enough to convince Patrick to sack up and ride the night out a little longer, but no. This weak-willed little worm made it clear he was going all-in on leaving early when he sat in the bathroom for, like, 20 minutes while everyone ate, only to emerge and ask Max’s parents for Advil so that he could convince them he was sick and needed to leave.
Is Patrick for real with this bullshit? Seriously, don’t go to the sleepover at all if you know you can’t hack it.

There’s no chance that Patrick is going to outright say that spending one measly evening away from his dumb fucking Hulk-themed bedspread makes him too homesick to cope, but the way he’s sulking around and not showing a hint of interest in checking out the late-night soft-core porn on Cinemax that his friends have all made plans to watch at 3 a.m. says everything we need to know.
For Christ’s sake, the real meat and potatoes of sleepover activities have not even started and you can tell Patrick is itching to pull the trigger. His friends are daring each other to watch the Pain Olympics on an iPad, while Patrick, this mewling dollop of shit, is sheepishly huddled alone in the corner with some exaggerated little pout on his face, muttering about how he won’t be able to sleep if he watches it, and it’s already going to be hard enough sleeping on the floor anyway.
This is so hard to watch. Just fucking go home already, Patrick. Put us all out of our misery.

Patrick’s friends are going to be having an amazing time and making memories all night tonight, but at this point the only way that Patrick can contribute to the fun is by getting the fuck out of Max’s basement and taking his shitty attitude with him.

Interview Essentials: Job Recruiters Say Riding Into An Interview On A Bejeweled Elephant Increases Your Chances Of Getting Hired By 5%,"If you’re currently on the job hunt and hoping to nail your next interview, you’re definitely going to want to read up on this latest tip: Job recruiters say riding into an interview on a bejeweled elephant increases your chances of getting hired by as much as 5 percent.
Wow. This is a priceless little hack that should go a long way toward sealing the deal at your next interview.

According to job recruitment experts, taking a little extra time to acquire an elephant, cover that elephant in jewels, and then ride the elephant gallantly into your next interview just might make the difference between landing your dream job and walking away empty-handed.
“Job interviews are all about good first impressions, so in addition to making strong eye contact with your interviewer and speaking with confidence, we recommend making a grand entrance atop an elephant covered in decorative rugs and a golden carriage,” says Anne Butters of Businessweek. “Riding into an interview on a shining elephant with a full procession of dancers, jugglers, servants, and singers, all raising their voices in worship to your name, communicates confidence, passion, and success, and can often make your interviewer interested in learning more about what you bring to the table.”
Obviously, riding an elephant covered in precious gems into a potential employer’s office doesn’t take the place of studying up on the company and practicing interview questions before the big day, but according to experts, crashing into your interviewer’s office on the back of a trumpeting elephant and having a throng of servants scurrying about to lower you from its back before beginning the interview process can sometimes give you a little extra edge in a crowded field of other qualified applicants.

Wow. Now that the benefits of making a grand entrance to your interview on a  elephant laden with glorious treasures are so clear, it’s time to give it a shot and see if it works for you.

Incredible Timing: The Backlash Against The Wellness Industry Has Coincided Perfectly With This Man’s Commitment To Not Making Any Meaningful Changes In His Life,"Every now and then in life, the stars align in just the right way for remarkable things to happen, and here’s an amazing example of just that: The recent backlash against the wellness industry has coincided perfectly with this man’s commitment to not making any meaningful changes in his life.
Hell yeah! For a lazy sack of shit like this guy, this absolutely could not have worked out better.

Over the past year, 28-year-old software engineer Nick Melton has intermittently flirted with the idea of taking on new healthy habits like practicing yoga and eating more plant-based meals, but there’s never been enough motivation for him to abandon his tried-and-true lifestyle of playing lots of video games and eating whatever the hell he wants. But luckily for Nick, he chose to double down on his sedentary lifestyle right at a time when there’s a growing resistance toward the wellness industry, with more and more news stories appearing each day about how weight loss isn’t actually that important for your health, how many vitamin supplements are actually snake oil, and how popular trends like juice cleanses are mostly just profit-driven scams that do more harm to consumers than good. So now when Nick deletes all the emails he gets from Headspace urging him to buy a monthly subscription, he can rest easy knowing that even though he really just doesn’t want to put forth the effort to meditate, to everyone else it looks like he’s simply heeding the latest recommendations of wellness experts.
Indeed, making absolutely zero effort to look after his health is really paying dividends for Nick. His reluctance to get into CrossFit now has him looking much smarter than his more fitness-inclined peers thanks to new studies that link the exercise program to heightened risk of long-term injury. And following a New York Times article questioning the benefits of using a standing desk, Nick’s choice to spend eight hours a day sitting in his computer chair now seems like an intentional and well-informed health decision, even though in reality he could not give less of a shit about taking care of his body.
Wow. Seems like it’s a truly fortuitous time to be a lazy oaf with no regard for personal well-being. Sometimes the universe throws you a bone, and it’s certainly done so for Nick. Here’s to happy coincidences!

Yoda Is Supposed To Be Just A Normal Guy (By George Lucas),"It’s been nearly 40 years since Yoda first appeared onscreen in The Empire Strikes Back, but there still seems to be a little confusion regarding how the character was meant to be perceived. Some fans of my films have let their imaginations run wild thinking that Yoda is supposed to be some kind of fantastical alien creature, but I assure you that was never my intention. I’d like to clear up, once and for all, any notion that Yoda is supposed to be anything other than a totally normal guy.
Yep, sorry if this is a letdown, but Yoda is just a regular person.
There are all sorts of crazy aliens and monsters in the Star Wars universe, but Yoda isn’t one of them. Look at Jabba the Hutt or Admiral Ackbar: They look nothing like humans. It’s obvious they’re supposed to be bizarre aliens. Yoda, on the other hand, has his eyes and ears and everything right where a human’s are. So the guy’s got a few wrinkles and is going a little bald. Just because Yoda isn’t young and conventionally attractive like most people in movies doesn’t make him some sort of weird alien. In the Star Wars universe people get old just like they do in the real world. Yoda is just an everyday, working-class guy who speaks with a bit of an Irish accent and likes to hang out in the swamp with his buds. Pay attention to the movies and it’s obvious that he’s just as human as you or me.

In a universe filled with larger-than-life heroes and villains, Yoda was meant to stand out as a regular guy everyone could relate to. After Star Wars fans mistook him for some great powerful creature in The Empire Strikes Back, I gave him bronchitis in Return Of The Jedi to show that he doesn’t have any sort of special powers outside of being a generally good dude. When people still seemed to think he was some kind of space alien, I figured showing a younger version of Yoda in The Phantom Menace would clear up that there was nothing unusual about him besides the typical effects of aging, but people still didn’t seem to understand that he was just an average, everyday guy.
To be clear: Yoda is supposed to be the kind of unpretentious guy you can crack a beer and watch the game with. A no-nonsense sort of fellow who can get along with anyone, who lives in a rural area outside of Milwaukee. Watch the Star Wars films again with that in mind and I bet everything will make a lot more sense.

In The Presence Of Greatness: This Man Watching Porn At The Public Library Has No Idea That He’s Sitting One Table Away From The Best History Student In Mrs. Miller’s Whole 4th-Grade Class,"Well, here’s a good reminder to pay attention to the world around you lest you miss the encounter of a lifetime: This man watching porn at the public library has no idea that he’s sitting just one table away from the best history student in Mrs. Miller’s whole fourth-grade class.
He’s sure going to be kicking himself when he realizes who he ignored to watch his pornography!If the man intently watching hard-core porn on the public library’s free wi-fi could turn away from his double-penetration videos for just one minute and look at who’s in the library with him, he’d discover that the boy at the table behind him is none other than James Leven, the star pupil of Mrs. Miller’s fourth-grade history class. It’s not every day that you’re seated by a kid who got 102 percent on his American Revolution unit test and had the first page of his Abraham Lincoln essay put up on the overhead projector to demonstrate good paragraph structure, but somehow the guy heedlessly streaming cum shot after cum shot on the library’s computer remains totally oblivious to his proximity to Carver Elementary’s resident history wunderkind.

We’re talking about the kid Mrs. Miller cast as George Washington in the class play here! How can this guy not appreciate that?You’ve got to feel bad for this haplessly unaware pornography enthusiast, because right now he’s watching three erotic videos simultaneously without headphones when he could be watching Leven construct an absolutely flawless diorama for Mrs. Miller’s “The First Thanksgiving” creative project. This is a student with perfect marks in quizzes, homework, and participation, and he’ll probably only be in the library for as long as it takes him to research what the pilgrims served for food and how they were dressed, so if this guy doesn’t take a break from wordlessly nodding at blowjob videos soon, he’ll miss his one shot at witnessing the learning process of the only kid in the fourth grade who can recite the preamble to the Constitution entirely from memory. It’s absolutely heartbreaking to watch him squander such an incredible opportunity!
You hate to see someone failing to make the most of an incredible chance encounter like this.

Though Smith saw complete anonymity as an overnight global sensation, he quickly built a reputation for being one of the kindest stars to earn absolutely no money being a jerk to millions of fans around the world right before he became friendly and rude!

But now? Well, let’s just say that back when Ice-T wasn’t rapping on TV during his early career in joblessness, Ice-T had massive fans following him for no reason when he made raps about being a star on Law & Order, a role he never had until he was fired from it for being famous right before everyone forgot who he was! He’s found fame portraying unknown cops since 2000, and he’s never been a rapper! He’s still a huge forgotten rap star today!

Scared Straight: This Program Pairs At-Risk Privileged Youth With White-Collar Criminals To Show Them The Horrors Of House Arrest,"Here’s a smart idea that could help straighten out affluent young offenders before it’s too late: This program pairs at-risk privileged youth with white-collar criminals to show them the horrors of house arrest.
Whoa. It may sound drastic, but something like this will definitely help wayward blue-blood teens think twice about illicitly trading stock tips!
Advertisement

The program, called the Affluent Youth Redirection Initiative, facilitates immersive encounters where well-heeled teens with persistent behavioral issues experience a harrowing day under house arrest in $3 million lake homes owned by convicted embezzlers and money launderers who, like the program’s participants, were once promising young upper-crusters themselves. Each teen spends 24 hours shadowing a disgraced former CEO or CFO as he monotonously swims laps in his rooftop infinity pool and binge-watches HBO Go, imparting the sobering message that all it takes is one failed Ponzi scheme to completely lose one’s freedom to take four-day weekends in the Hamptons. While forcing the kids to wear ankle bracelets and exposing them to the terrifying realities of white-collar house arrest may sound extreme, it’s often the exact shock to the system these privileged teens need to clean up their act before they get busted for wire fraud and have to accept a plea deal from a judge who belonged to the same Princeton eating club as them.
It’s better that these wealthy kids spend a day simulating the horrors of house arrest now than spend up to six months having to live it for real later.
“A lot of these delinquents show up pretty cocky, but by the time I show them the non-regulation squash court I have to practice on, they’re almost always in tears,” said Gabriel Frampton, a former Goldman Sachs analyst serving three months for insider trading and one of the Affluent Youth Redirection Initiative’s criminal participants. “When you’re living under house arrest, you can no longer go out to dinners and have no choice but to eat whatever your personal chef makes you. There’s no one to talk to except your mistresses and your wife’s purebred Yorkshire terriers. There’s nowhere to drive the Rolls-Royces in your garage, you miss out on countless black-tie galas, and the only ‘rock climbing’ you’re gonna be doing is on the 15-foot bouldering wall in your home gym. It’s hell, and the Harvard-to-house-arrest pipeline is going to keep eating these kids alive unless we step in to help them.”

It’s nice to see white-collar criminals doing what they can to give affluent teens a shot at a better life. Privilege is a terrible thing to waste, so here’s hoping these teens take the program’s lessons to heart.

5 Times Bob Costas Tried To Give Himself Pink Eye Again Since The 2014 Winter Olympics,"During the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, sportscaster Bob Costas came down with a case of conjunctivitis in both eyes that had him making as many headlines as the medal-winning athletes. Here are five times Bob Costas tried to give himself pink eye again since the 2014 Winter Olympics. 
1. The time Bob Costas recruited 20 people with pink eye to come to the NBC studio for “football research,” and then made them touch his eyes: In the fall of 2015, Bob Costas asked his production team to find 20 people with active pink eye for “some research he was doing about football.” Once everyone was gathered in the studio, Bob Costas told the participants he had a big day of football research planned for a special he was producing on NBC, but the only directive he gave participants was, “Touch my eyeball if you like football.” Even though 16 participants liked football enough to oblige Costas, his eyes remained unchanged, aside from the stream of tears that appeared after he realized he wouldn’t be able to show off a fresh new case of pink eye to the world quite yet.

2. The time Bob Costas kept dipping his face in puddles of water on the side of the pool during the 2016 Summer Olympics swimming trials: Bob Costas was announcing the Women’s Olympic swimming trials in Rio de Janeiro when he attempted to contract more pink eye by using commercial breaks to splash his face with water that had been swum in by dozens of people from around the world. During what was supposed to be a post-race interview with Olympian Katie Ledecky, Costas instead told her that “pink eye is a wonderful disease that makes everyone pay attention to you,” got on all fours to splash himself some more, and did not ask her any questions. However, despite a full day of ferociously splashing his eyes with pool water, Bob Costas had failed to contract pink eye yet again, and wept about it for a full half hour on live TV.
3. The time Bob Costas farted on his pillow before going to sleep: In early 2017, Bob Costas tried to get pink eye by sleeping face-down on a pillow that he had completely coated in farts. He made sure to taint every possible inch of the pillow, even going so far as to unzip the pillowcase to fart directly into the pillow material, compressing the pillow and then letting it expand again in the hopes that it’d absorb his farts like a sponge. Sadly for Costas, when he woke up in the middle of the night to check his eyes with a hand mirror, they were white as snow.
4. The time Bob Costas took a shit on his pillow before going to sleep: Costas found himself wired awake on that very same night after realizing that his farts didn’t do the trick. Still desperate for pink eye, he decided to up the ante by taking a full-on shit on his pillow and sleeping in it face-first, only to realize the next morning that this method would prove just as fruitless as the others that had preceded it.

5. The time Bob Costas made up a segment on Sunday Night Football called “Contact Swap” where every commentator had to switch contacts with the person next to them: During the Philadelphia Eagles-vs.-Seattle Seahawks game of December 2017, Bob Costas revealed that it was time for “Contact Swap,” a segment where the commentators have to take out their contacts and pass them to the person to their right after every touchdown. When fellow commentator Cris Collinsworth protested,  Costas begged him to comply, and insisted that “football fans will love to play along at home.” Unfortunately, none of the commentators had enough ocular bacteria to infect Bob Costas with pink eye, rendering Costas heartbroken that he might never reclaim the itchy, discharge-ridden glory he experienced before millions of NBC viewers in 2014.

Disney World Has Launched A New DNA Testing Service Where You Send Them A Sample Of Your Vomit To Find Out If Your Ancestors Ever Puked On Space Mountain,"Disney World is doing something really cool for anyone who wants to find out more about their family tree: Park officials just announced that Disney World has launched a new  DNA testing service where you send them a sample of your vomit to find out if your ancestors ever puked on Space Mountain!
No more wondering if a great-great-grandparent or a distant cousin ever got nauseous on Disney’s beloved intergalactic roller coaster. It’s time to uncover your past!

According to its website, Disney World’s new test facilities use just a tiny sample of your own vomit to see if it matches the DNA profile of any of the vomit it’s collected from people who have puked on Space Mountain throughout history. The test can even tell you which section of the roller coaster prompted your family member to puke in the first place.

Just think: Every time you ride Space Mountain from now on, you’ll totally be able to picture all your ancestors alongside you, puking their guts out. It’s powerful stuff.

6 BAD Meals (Do Not Make Them),"These six meals are simply horrible. Do not make them under any circumstances.

Salmon with no sauce and a muffin is a truly terrible meal that you must not cook (because it is no good). Here’s how you do it (though you should not do it): Gather two salmon fillets, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, butter, an egg, and some milk. Put the salmon in the oven (with nothing on it so that it will taste like salmon and nothing else) and combine the ingredients for the muffin mix. Bake the muffins (flavor: plain muffin, no flavor) at 350 degrees for 1 minute. Remove both from the oven. Congratulations: You are finished with the BAD meal that will make you upset. Do not make this meal.

You can make a bowl of just rice for breakfast, lunch, or dinner if you are looking for a meal that could not be worse. Boil two plastic cups with one cup of rice, then reduce to a simmer until all the rice is fully cooked in plastic cups and BAD. Your rice will not taste like much beyond plastic and will not get you full. Why would you make it? You must not. It is VERY BAD.

This meal is an omelette that costs $8,000 because it is full of high-tech nanochips—it will bankrupt you and it will taste BAD so please refrain from cooking it. To make the omelette, add three beaten eggs to an oiled pan  (do not season or pay attention to the eggs). Flip over. Add many nanochips (thousands of dollars’ worth). RECIPE NOTE: It is vital that you do not make this recipe because of how much it will cost you and also because of the fact that it is 100 percent BAD.

Delicious steak tastes good, but very boring steak is, as far as meals go, absolutely BAD. The only step of making boring steak is making it. Voilà, you have boring steak (don’t do this). We suggest that you do something else, like watch a romantic comedy. This meal is also paleo.

Please do not make a bench as a meal. You will hate the meal because it will be as huge as it is BAD. A meal you could try making instead would be pasta (this would be a much better meal).

Three worsened cookies is an easy, store-bought meal that is BAD.

Huge Oversight: ‘Jeopardy’ Is Reclaiming Thousands Of Dollars From Ken Jennings After Rewatching The Tapes And Realizing He Didn’t Get A Single Question Right,"After over 50 years on the air, it seems like the team at Jeopardy! would be on top of things, but even a beloved institution of television sometimes makes mistakes: Jeopardy! has announced that it is reclaiming thousands of dollars from former champion Ken Jennings after rewatching the tapes and realizing he didn’t get a single question right during his time on the show.  
Wow. This is an extremely embarrassing misstep.
Producers say the trouble began earlier this week, when they began reviewing footage of Ken Jennings’ record-setting Jeopardy! run and noticed that he racked up $2,000 for buzzing in with the word “Miranda” in a category titled “Starts with ‘E.’” Following this shocking discovery, officials continued to look back at Jennings’ $2.5 million winning streak and noticed that in 74 games of Jeopardy!, Jennings did not answer a single question correctly or even come remotely close to doing so—despite always being named the winner at the end of every episode. 
Advertisement

Upon closer inspection, the producers discovered that Jennings answered every Final Jeopardy question with either the phrase “Día De Los Muertos” written in bubble letters or the phrase “lumber and grain” with an exclamation point, neither of which were ever the correct answer. As a result, Jennings has been asked to return all of his winnings at his earliest convenience.
“In all the excitement of Ken Jennings’ record-breaking performance on Jeopardy!, it appears we may have overlooked the fact that his answers were entirely incorrect every single time,” said Jeopardy! director Clay Jacobsen in a statement yesterday. “After reexamining Mr. Jennings’ performance, we unfortunately cannot allow Jennings to keep money that he earned for responding, ‘What is Jane Eyre?’ to the prompt, ‘This element has the atomic number 3 on the periodic table,’ or for claiming that the director of the film Casablanca was ‘Billy Joel’s album The Stranger.’ We sincerely regret the error.” 
 So embarrassing. Jeopardy! producers are currently in the process of retrieving the millions of dollars of winnings from Jennings and have asked if he would like to return to the show for the chance to get even one single question right. Hopefully both parties can get things straightened out soon!

Price Of Hubris: This Kid Who Said He Was Old Enough To Bowl Without Bumpers Just Rolled 8 Gutter Balls In A Row And Now He’s Crying In The Back Room Reserved For Parties,"Here’s a story that proves once again that if you fly too close to the sun, you’re inevitably gonna get burned: This kid who said he was old enough to bowl without bumpers just rolled eight gutter balls in a row, and now he’s crying in the back room reserved for parties.
Sorry, kid, but if you can’t walk the walk, don’t talk the talk.
Arguing that he wasn’t a baby anymore and that he’d gone bowling enough times to hold his own at the sport without any special accommodations, 7-year-old Ryan O’Connor successfully convinced his mother before a family bowling outing today to let him bowl without bumpers for the very first time. However, after arriving at the bowling alley, it quickly became clear that Ryan was not as capable of a bowler as he claimed to be, as when it came time for his first roll, he picked up an 11-pound ball that he could barely carry, waddled over to the lane, and immediately chucked it into the gutter. Although he brushed this off as “a practice bowl that didn’t count,” things didn’t get any better for him moving forward, as he went on to rack up seven more gutter balls over his next seven turns, leading him to ultimately break down in tears and retreat to one of the party rooms in the back of the bowling alley to mope by himself.

When his mom went to the party room to comfort him, Ryan refused to accept any responsibility for his piss-poor performance. He blamed the gutter balls on his bowling shoes not fitting correctly, even though it was obvious to everyone watching that his failure was the result of his lack of arm strength and his highly deranged bowling technique, which involves seizing the ball with his thumb, index, and middle fingers in a clawlike fashion and flailing his arm forward as hard as he can, making no particular effort to control the ball’s trajectory. His mom, understanding these mechanical flaws, then gently recommended that they raise the bumpers for the remainder of the game to make things easier. But this suggestion only upset Ryan further, compelling him to run off sobbing to the arcade area of the bowling alley, where he proceeded to dance along to the demo screen of Dance Dance Revolution for the next half an hour, believing he was actually playing.
All in all, not a good look for a kid who was talking such a big game about his bowling abilities.
Ryan is definitely learning a hard lesson today about the price of hubris, but chances are he’ll come out of this embarrassing saga with a better understanding of his own limitations. One of his classmates is having a birthday party at the bowling alley next month, so here’s hoping he can get his expectations in check by then and simply try to have a good time.

7 Modern Dating Rules That Don’t Mean Shit In The Swamp,"Modern dating can be complicated, but there are some easy-to-follow guidelines that will ensure your success as you play the field. Of course, down in the swamp those rules don’t mean a goddamn thing.
Disappearing from someone’s life with no explanation is a selfish, immature act that is absolutely expected in the swamp. Down on the bayou, nobody’s gonna be waiting around to hear you explain anything. If you fade away on someone after a few dates, they’ll assume a gator got you and carry on—might seem harsh, but that’s swamp life for you.

You might think, “It’s 2018, and whoever wants to make the first move can do so,” but that just won’t fly in the swamp. If you’re gonna make the first move on someone, you’d better make sure you’re standing on higher ground than them, topographically speaking. Reason being, your crush’s feet are likely coming down with a mean case of swamp rot from sloshing around down in the water, and it’s only polite for you to invite them up on dry land. So forget your precious equal-opportunity dating when you’re in the swamp, because down there it’s nothing but frivolous city talk. 
You’d be luckier than a hungry snake in a possum den if you were able to find a phone down in the swamp, so if you want to tell your date you had a nice time, you’ll have to leave a message with the Swamp Postmaster. The Swamp Postmaster is a 120-year-old snapping turtle, and you can find her paddlin’ up and down the banks. She’s trustworthy as hell, but real, real slow, so there’s a good chance your message will be delivered months or even years late. That means that if you enjoyed your date, you’re gonna want to get that message sent as soon as it’s finished, and pray to god your crush has a hardy enough constitution to make it through the heat of next summer.

In the swamp you’ve got two date spots to choose from: the Muck Hut (a hut in the middle of the muck) or the Bog Shack (a shack in the middle of the bog). No, they’re not exactly the Ritz-Carlton, but if you want any kind of cover from the mosquitos, they’ll have to do. And you’ll want to keep the date quick and no-nonsense, because come sundown, the water moccasins will be comin’ around to sleep. If you want “comfort” included in your dating rulebook, try moving to the suburbs.
This might be a dating rule in the rest of the U.S., but down on the bayou it might as well be nonsense. The first thing you’re gonna want to bring on a swamp date is the best weapon you’ve got—be it a machete, hunting rifle, or a lasso made out of dead snakes—because there’s no telling who or what you’re gonna encounter during an evening out. Showing up empty-handed will be a major red flag to your date that you’re a weakling who couldn’t even stand their ground against a whooping crane. That’s a surefire way to make sure you’ll never find a husband or wife down in the marsh.

Hell no—nobody’s having sex in the swamp. Closest thing down here is pulling leeches off your partner’s ass, which luckily is as romantic as it is practical.
Accepting that relationships won’t always work out is a normal part of dating, but when you’re living in the swamp, it’s a different story. If you meet somebody with all 10 toes whose family isn’t in any kind of blood feud with yours, it’s time to hold on tight and refuse to let go. Ain’t anything better comin’ around. That might not be how it works out for city folk, but it’s how it works in the swamp, and you’d better wise up and get used to it.

Fundamental Misunderstanding Of Adventure: An Investigation Into This Couple’s #SaturdayAdventures Hashtag Reveals That Most Of Their ‘Adventures’ Are Just Going To Restaurants,"In this era of rampant misinformation, it’s more important than ever to not take everything you see on social media at face value, and here’s yet another story that proves why: An investigation into this couple’s #SaturdayAdventures hashtag reveals that the vast majority of their “adventures” are just going to restaurants.
After sustained examination, it becomes exceedingly clear that these people have a fundamental misunderstanding of the definition of the word “adventure.”

For much of their five-year relationship, 32-year-old Sara Byers and 30-year-old boyfriend Ryan Dunham have routinely documented their weekends together on Instagram and Facebook using  #SaturdayAdventures, the wording of which instantly calls to mind the pulse-pounding, high-flying exploits of famed big-screen adventurers like Indiana Jones. However, when clicking through the 37 different posts to which the couple has assigned the hashtag, the vast majority of the posts are merely just pictures of Sara and Ryan eating at various restaurants together, a pattern that suggests that they consider going out for dim sum to be an activity on par with traversing dangerous jungle terrain or raiding ancient temples for long-forgotten treasure.
Often accompanied with captions like “Exploring a new neighborhood with my favorite guy!” and “We saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins And Dives and just HAD to check it out!!!” most of the couple’s “#SaturdayAdventures” posts involve the two of them visiting restaurants located in the same city where they live and don’t require any harrowing journeys or heroic deeds in order to get a table. Sara and Ryan clearly have tremendous difficulties understanding the difference between going on an adventure and just eating food.
Sadly, it seems at this point that Sara and Ryan are doomed to remain ignorant as to what constitutes an actual adventure, and the experiences which they choose to label “#SaturdayAdventures” will remain wildly off-base for the foreseeable future. The couple’s tragic tale should serve as yet another cautionary tale about the power of social media to mislead people. Hopefully anyone who sees their posts will be smart enough tell the difference between going to a restaurant and going on an epic, pulse-pounding journey!

Emergency Recall: Rogaine Is Pulling Its Product From Shelves After Discovering That It Has The Unintended Side Effect Of Doubling Customers’ Penis Sizes,"Men, check those medicine cabinets, because a common over-the-counter drug just issued an emergency recall: Rogaine is pulling all its products from shelves after discovering that they have the unintended side effect of doubling customers’ penis sizes.
Terrifying. Imagine just wanting to treat your hair loss and winding up with a gigantic penis.

In a grave announcement put out earlier today, Rogaine warned that men using its hair-regrowth formula are in immediate danger of having their penises double in both length and girth as a side effect of the medication, and instructed anyone possessing the product to dispose of it as soon as possible. The company warned that not only will many men be afflicted with much larger penises, but users may also suffer from increased sexual stamina and libido, making it highly probable that their sex lives will never return to how they were before. Somehow this horrifying adverse reaction made it past FDA testing, and now thousands of Rogaine users will likely have to adjust to a scary reality in which their sexual partners are consistently satisfied by the nearly footlong penises they’ve been involuntarily bestowed.
This is seriously every man’s worst nightmare.
“We are currently in the process of updating Rogaine’s formula to ensure that users can benefit from reliable hair-loss treatment without having to worry about any unwanted increases in penis size or general sexual potency,” said Rogaine in a statement to the press. “If you are a customer who has experienced significant penis growth or increased virility, please talk to your doctor about options for restoring your penis back to its original unremarkable proportions.”

Even if Rogaine manages to fix its product, its name is pretty much synonymous with “spectacularly large penises” at this point, and it’s unclear whether it’ll ever be able to live down such a damning reputation. Consumers are going to be a lot more wary of using medication associated with longer and more intense orgasms for both them and their partners, and Rogaine can expect to see a lot of longtime users jump ship to other products with a better track record on keeping penises the same size.
However bad Rogaine is hurting right now, it’s not half as bad as it is for the men whose genitals it has so recklessly enlarged. Here’s hoping that pharmaceutical companies will learn from this and realize that the possibility of penis enlargement is not an acceptable risk to take with its customers’ bodies!",NaN,2018-10-08T10:46:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ZiBvrefd--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/xiymzjcvywopjifjlign.jpg",Fake

"Class Action Lawsuit: If Your Head Has Been Stuck In A Bugles Vending Machine For Over 10 Years, You May Be Entitled To A Free Pack Of Bugles","Listen up, because this story could have serious consequences for you or someone you love: If your head has been stuck in a Bugles vending machine for more than 10 years, you may be entitled to a free pack of Bugles thanks to a class action lawsuit.
This is about justice, plain and simple. If you’ve dealt with pain and suffering as a result of living with your head stuck in a Bugles machine, this ruling will hopefully mitigate some of your hurt.

General Mills, the company that manufactures Bugles, has come under fire recently from a group that identifies itself as “The Vending Machine Crew”—hundreds of individuals whose heads are all trapped inside of full-service vending machines. Each of their stories are different—one single mom put her head up the machine to retrieve a stuck pack of Bugles for her son, while one young man got trapped in an attempt to get a closer look at the Bugles’ weight in ounces as described on the front of the bag—but together, they’ve managed to win justice for people stuck in Bugles vending machines worldwide.
“After over 10 years of missing football games, dance recitals, work, and school because we can’t extricate ourselves from these enormous Bugles snack apparatuses no matter how much we flail our limbs, we came together to take our story to court and demand compensation,” said the group’s leader, a teacher with his head shoved all the way under the bottom flap of a vending machine.
And it worked! Just today, a federal court officially ordered General Mills to give one bag of Bugles to each of the plaintiffs—and anyone else who has had part or all of their head stuck inside of a Bugles vending machine for a decade or more. Joe Myrick, the judge presiding over the case, told reporters, “People who have gone through the hardship that comes with having their bodies dangling out of a Bugles vending machine for a good portion of their lives deserve recompense from General Mills, and today they will receive just that.”

 So, if you fit the description of someone who has had their head stuck in a Bugles vending machine for 10-plus years, it’s time to claim the reward to which you are entitled!

‘He’s Not A Good Character At All’: Disney Has Announced That It’s Honestly Pretty Baffled By The Continued Popularity Of Mickey Mouse,"After nearly a century of dominating the film, animation, and theme park game, it’s fair to say that the Walt Disney Company knows a thing or two about entertainment. But despite all this, apparently the mass-media conglomerate still can’t quite fully grasp the rhyme and reason behind much of its success: Disney just announced that it’s honestly pretty baffled by the continued popularity of Mickey Mouse.
Noting that he looks dumb as hell, has no memorable qualities, and the only notable movie he’s ever starred in was a weird orchestra concert in the ’40s, Disney put out a statement today expressing its profound confusion as to why Mickey Mouse remains so widely adored to this day. The company explained that while it understands why he was popular in the ’30s, when seeing literally any moving drawing was still a great source of amazement, it has absolutely no clue how Mickey managed to become a globally beloved character who has persistently generated hundreds of millions of dollars in merchandise sales year after year since the Great Depression.

“If you just look at Mickey Mouse for two seconds, it’s obvious that he’s not a good character at all,” said Disney in a press release, noting that his clothes and general appearance make no sense whatsoever, and that unlike his contemporaries Donald Duck and Goofy, he exhibits no discernible emotional complexity. “He’s not in any way interesting or funny, and he doesn’t have any extraordinary abilities. Like, who’s even introducing their children to Mickey Mouse in this day and age? People know that Disney has much, much better characters than this, right? We’ve got all the Toy Story guys now and the Star Wars guys—so many fun guys to choose from. But for some inexplicable reason, kids keep coming back to Mickey.”
“Also, don’t forget that pretty much all of Mickey’s early cartoons were outrageously racist,” the statement continued. “You’ve got, like, 20 different cartoons where he’s basically just tap-dancing in blackface and eating watermelon. How is everyone still on board with him after that? It’s just weird, you guys.”
In the statement, Disney went on to speculate that if people are this head-over-heels for an unremarkable rodent character whose only discernible personality trait is smiling, then it could probably put out a new movie full of half-assed characters like “a pine cone with lips” or “a badger in a ball cap” and it would gross over a billion dollars. Disney also noted that it feels it’s “downright bizarre” how people don’t seem the least bit unsettled by the fact that Mickey’s spouse is essentially just an exact genetic clone of himself but wearing a dress.

While Disney made sure to clarify that it appreciates fans’ continued support of Mickey, it conceded that it does think it might be indicative of some sort of grand collective sickness of the human mind. What do YOU think? Does Mickey still deserve the caliber of fame he enjoys? Or are you also baffled by his cultural staying power? Let us know in the comments!

Surprised This Lucky Fan By Tumbling Dead Out Of The Overhead Bin After A
16-Hour Flight To Japan","Bill Murray just cemented his reputation as one of the best pranksters of all time with his latest epic stunt.

"I Am Still Hungover From The 2009 Beer Summit
(by Barack Obama)","America is a work in progress. Our nation doesn’t always live up to its ideals of equality, but together we can learn from our mistakes and strive toward a more perfect union. That’s why in the first year of my presidency, I held the Beer Summit at the White House as a public forum to address racism head on, and I am still very hungover from that event. 
The Bud Light I drank at the Beer Summit was a huge mistake. God, I really feel like shit.
Advertisement

When Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested by Cambridge police officer James Crowley  while trying to break into his own home, it sparked a nationwide controversy. Some viewed this as a case of racial profiling by law enforcement, while others thought it was a reasonable misunderstanding. Whichever viewpoint you hold, it is unfortunately true that I have been extremely nauseous and light-headed ever since the day I met with both men in the Rose Garden to help hash out their differences. And it’s one of those hangovers that hits you from all angles, too—headache, upset stomach, that weird depressed feeling, everything. I feel sick just typing this.
The pounding headache I woke up with after the Beer Summit plagued me continuously over my two presidential terms, and made it extremely difficult to concentrate on any of my policy goals. Every time I gave a speech or met with legislators, all I could think about was lying down and closing my eyes. The bin Laden raid should have been one of the most triumphant memories of my presidency, but I almost missed the moment we got him because I was in the bathroom puking my guts out. The lights in the situation room were just too bright—torture for someone with a Beer Summit-induced hangover as bad as mine. 
After my presidency, I accepted a ride on Richard Branson’s yacht in hopes that the sea air would cure my hangover where all else had failed. Unfortunately, a tropical vacation proved no more effective than the countless aspirin tablets  I have taken over the years since the Beer Summit. It seems like nothing will make this absolute bitch of a hangover go away. Michelle bought me some Pedialyte, but no luck.

Although I still believe that the Beer Summit was a positive example of interracial communication, frankly I wish I had never held that event. The hangover is not worth whatever small blow I struck against racial prejudice. To be perfectly honest, I would rather live in a slightly more racist world than feel the way I do right now.

Silent Hero: This Dog Has No Idea It Is Single-Handedly Supporting Nearly Every Conversation At This Party,"Here’s an incredible story about an unsung hero that, by simply going about its normal existence, is making the world a better place: This dog named Pilot has no idea it is single-handedly supporting nearly every conversation at this party.
Absolutely beautiful. This dog may not know it, but it is actively making this awkward party bearable in a major way.
Advertisement

Before the party even started, Pilot’s quiet heroism was already at work. A friend of the host’s friend had arrived 20 minutes before anyone else, all but guaranteeing a long, forced conversation that neither participants wanted to take part in. But luckily, Pilot didn’t hesitate to jump up on the early guest immediately, giving the host an easy segue into a reasonably natural talk about the dog’s name, age, and breed just as the panic of an incoming stilted dialogue was setting in.
As the rest of the party guests arrive, this dog continues to save the day over and over again simply by walking around and giving everyone at this unbelievably boring party something easy to talk about, like how well-behaved he is or his cute attempts to sneak food off the snack table. Running out of things to say is not a possibility with Pilot present, and though he may not know it, literally every guest present is keeping him on their radar so they can point at him and say, “Oh my god, look what the dog’s doing now,” or “What a good boy,” when conversations start getting stale.
In one particularly moving act of brave intrepidity, the dog started barking at nothing in particular, which immediately gave about eight half-hearted, dead-end conversations at this party a much-needed jolt of enthusiasm as their topics all turned back to him and how great dogs are.
Advertisement

For every time someone walks away from a small circle of guests to go get another drink, leaving only two barely acquainted people standing next to each other, Pilot will selflessly eat half a cracker that someone dropped on the ground or offer his belly up to be scratched and petted, giving two awkward guests a chance to chuckle and then ask each other if they own a dog, or some other type of pet. 
If that’s not heroism, we don’t know what is.
 This dog will never receive any praise or recognition for the incredible godsend it’s been for everyone at this party, nor will it ever expect it, but it sure makes it easier to sleep at night knowing there are silent heroes like him there to bail people out of bad party conversations.

Crisis For Christianity? Biblical Scholars Have Discovered That The 12 Apostles Considered Jesus More Like The Fez Of Their Friend Group Than Their Leader,"New research out of Oxford University’s Biblical Studies department has just uncovered shocking new information that has Christians all over the world reconsidering their religious beliefs entirely: Biblical scholars have discovered that the Twelve Apostles considered Jesus more like the Fez of their friend group than their leader.
The faith of millions must be utterly shaken right now.
According to newly uncovered writings from Apostolic-era Jerusalem, the disciples’ personal accounts of Jesus reveal that most of his friends thought of him as the foreign guy who everyone mostly enjoyed hanging out with because of his eccentricities, not unlike how the teens of Point Place, Wisconsin regarded the character Fez in the sitcom That ’70s Show.
Advertisement

“These incredible texts completely erase the notion that the apostles followed Jesus for his spiritual guidance, and instead, show us that they mainly started inviting Jesus of Nazareth to hang out with them because they were entertained by his amusing exoticism, which they assumed was the cultural norm in Nazareth, just as Fez’s peers wrote off his behavior as standard for whatever country he was from,” explained Oxford professor Richard Boesch. “For example, the apostles were amused and bewildered by Christ’s bizarre decision to stand on a rock and announce that it counts as adultery even if you simply just feel lust for someone else. The apostles understood this to be a foreign guy’s way of expressing how incredibly horny he was, and just sort of rolled with it the way Fez’s friends just sort of rolled with all of his unusual behaviors.”
Professor Boesch added that Jesus’ role as the Fez of his friend group was further illustrated by passages in the newly discovered texts that indicate that, following Jesus’ crucifixion, the apostles did not go on to spread the word of Christ because they believed in his moral teachings or because they felt he was in charge of them, but rather because they wanted to tell everyone all about their hilarious foreign friend who was obsessed with giving people large amounts of fish.
This discovery serves as a severe blow to centuries upon centuries of beliefs regarding the central figure of Christianity, which are largely based on Christ’s role as a well-respected and influential leader like That ’70s Show’s charismatic pretty boy, Michael Kelso, or perhaps the sitcom’s central protagonist, Eric Forman. Instead, overwhelming evidence has proven that all Twelve Apostles considered Jesus to be a super-horny foreign guy like Fez.

This is definitely a watershed moment in world history. Those who abide Jesus’ teachings must be shocked to learn that who they believed to be the one true Messiah was actually a true Fez. Modern Christianity must now adapt to the new revelation that the figure they worship as the Messiah was viewed by his friends as  the token foreign guy who they would bring everywhere just to see what kind of weird stuff he would do. For now, it suffices to say that Christians will never look at their Lord and Savior the same way again.",NaN,2018-10-03T11:22:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--uMYoHNNE--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/kp6xtfqevshqphqxkg9e.jpg",Fake

‘[Skateboarding] [Has Always Been] The [Thing] [I Am Good At]’: These 5 Tony Hawk Quotes Originally Made No Fucking Sense And Have Been Very Heavily Edited For Clarity,"We did what was supposed to be a quick interview with Tony Hawk about his career, but it turns out that he is not very articulate and most of what he said was completely unintelligible. Here are five quotes that we edited heavily for clarity.
Tony Hawk had a pretty hard time explaining himself when we asked him how he knew he wanted to be a professional skateboarder, so we had to edit him down to what was arguably the main sentiment he was trying to get across. After spending about 20 minutes trying to describe what his skateboard looked like using a diagram of what was clearly a minivan, Tony said, “And now it’s time for me to tell you what happens when I sit on my incredible board.” At that point we really tried to help coax a quote out of him, but he kept calling skateboarding “sliding around” and all he would say about it was “I like it better than you do.” We took that to pretty much mean that he has always had a talent for skateboarding and pieced together what we could.
Advertisement

Very little of what Tony told us about his typical day was salvageable, starting with when he explained that he doesn’t eat Mentos every day but could if he wanted to, then mumbled for a while about how Mentos are “the fattest mints that exist.” We threw him a few softballs like “How often do you work out?” but what he said about his workout regimen made basically no sense, and he referred at least 15 times to a man he called “old, tired Claude,” which is what it seems like he calls himself when he’s at the gym. At some point Tony mentioned eating lunch, so we ran with that and pretty much put the rest of the quote together from our best guesses about how his life probably works.
The gist of what Tony Hawk said about success was that it was equivalent to happiness, but the way he expressed that was mostly by pulling up hundreds of photos of smiling chimps on his phone, scrolling through them, and saying, “See, now that’s good.” We figured that as long as he said the word “success,” taking down a quote like this one was reasonably fair. Trust us, you would not want to spend your time wading through what he actually said. Three different people had to work for an entire week trying to transcribe the recording. It was supposed to just be a quick, light-hearted interview, but Tony made it very difficult on everyone.
Advertisement

This was the clearest quote we were able to get out of Tony by a long shot. Several hours into the interview we asked him about his work developing a new skateboarding video game in a desperate attempt to get a grabby quote like “The game I want to do next is gonna be the raddest Tony Hawk video game yet.” But after Tony spent a while explaining that video games are fun because “they are like real life but insane,” he then got up to yell at passing cars for a while. After that, Tony turned back toward us and said, “My favorite food is pizza.” We wrote that down immediately.
We thought we were going to get a declarative statement when Tony started a sentence with “I’m,” but that was not the case at all. Instead, Tony followed up the “I’m” with a high-pitched squeal and jumped in the passenger seat of what looked like someone else’s Lyft, which then peeled out and drove away. We’re not entirely sure if this quote represents what he was trying to say, but hopefully this is a fairly accurate interpretation. This interview was truly a nightmare for everyone involved.

7 Things To Know Before Taking Your First Shit,"Shitting for the first time can be daunting, but you don’t have to go in cold. Here are seven things to know before taking your first shit.
It’s super exciting to make it inside the bathroom, but just because you’re in there doesn’t mean you can start shitting. It’s a classic rookie mistake to shit in the tub or the sink, or to shit your pants while standing in front of the toilet, so keep in mind that there’s only one place in the bathroom where you can shit, and it’s directly into the toilet bowl.
Advertisement

There’s no telling how long your shit will last, but if it’s been several hours and you’re not done, don’t freak out! It’s not unusual for a shit to last 16 hours. Just as a precaution, give your boss a heads-up that you’re shitting and might be unable to make it into the office until you’re done.
You know how pants keep your shit in? Yeah, it’s the worst. Luckily, there’s an easy fix for that: Simply cut a hole in the bottom of your pants so that your shit can get out! It’s a good idea to keep clothing shears in your bathroom cabinet so you’re ready whenever nature calls.
Advertisement

Humming a rocking song is sure to take your shit to the next level. The song we’re currently humming while we shit? Ace Frehley’s “New York Groove”!
Ugh, we know, we know. This would definitely be awesome to do, but unfortunately it creates a massive amount of pressure that first explodes your heart and then rockets you through the bathroom roof. Not even the most experienced shitters dare to attempt this.

Three bucks (cash only) will be collected at the end of every shit, so you should make sure you’ve got the bills handy in order to avoid a late fee. However, the good news is that it’s a flat rate, so no matter how much you shit out, it’s only going to be $3, and hallelujah, that’s a bargain if we’ve ever seen one!
Every subsequent shit you take will become exponentially more challenging, demanding increasingly more stamina and bravery as time goes on and shits go by. But fear not! Your body will only give you the shits you can handle, even if they push you to your absolute physical, mental, and spiritual limits.

End Of An Era: The 6th-Grader Who Wore The Same Green Day Shirt From Kohl’s For The First 18 Days Of School Is Finally Wearing Other Clothes Now ,"It looks like one of the most legendary streaks in the history of Holland Middle School in Powell, OH, has finally come to an end: The sixth-grader who wore the same Green Day shirt from Kohl’s for the first 18 days of school has now started to wear other clothes.
Damn. It was a hell of a run, kid.
When Logan Watkins arrived on the first day of school proudly sporting a brand-new Green Day T-shirt that his mom had bought him, there was no indication that he was laying the groundwork for something big. But when the 11-year-old stepped off the bus the next morning wearing the exact same shirt, and then again the day after that, hype around the streak steadily began to build, and Logan was only getting started. When all was said and done, Logan would don the American Idiot shirt for the first 18 days of school straight, taking the Kohl’s clearance-rack garment on an incredible, damn-near three-week tour that, amazingly, continued nonstop until this morning, when he strolled into first period wearing a faded Cleveland Cavaliers jersey tee instead of the famous Green Day shirt that’d become his trademark.

Wow. It truly is the end of an era.
The fact that the streak endured a full 18 days is nothing short of remarkable, as there were countless times along the way when the feat seemed doomed. Yet Logan always persevered. When Taylor Burke yanked on the neck of the shirt and stretched the shit out of it during a game of recess flag football on day eight, it seemed all but inevitable that Logan would need to change into a different shirt, but he nonetheless persevered. He persevered after spilling an ass-load of Thousand Island dressing on the shirt on day 10, and he persevered through the humiliation of Talia Clester straight-up telling him he smelled like shit on day 13. Incredibly, he even persevered despite Mr. Rafferty’s explicit orders for him to wear a collared shirt for his big social studies presentation on day 15, courageously defying authority in service of a greater cause. Against all odds, he persevered in wearing that Green Day shirt for 18 consecutive days, and while it didn’t seem to win the respect of his peers or benefit him in any perceivable way, the fact that he kept the streak alive for so long is beyond extraordinary.
While it’s true that the streak has come to an end, there’s no doubt that the memory of Logan’s 18-day feat will live on at Holland Middle School long after he graduates on to high school. Here’s hoping that Logan brings back the Green Day shirt as soon as his mom washes it so that everyone can once again relive the magic of those glorious 18 days.

4 So-Called Advanced Civilizations That Couldn’t Even Fucking Invent Soda,"Historians love to ramble on and on about ancient civilizations that were supposedly advanced beyond their years, and yet none of these civilizations can claim the simple invention of soda among their achievements. Here are four so-called advanced civilizations that couldn’t even manage to come up with soda.
You’d think that one of the earliest civilizations known to man would’ve come right out of the gate with a fucking slam dunk invention like soda, but these morons would gladly prove you wrong. They wasted their time on boring-ass innovations like public drainage systems and dentistry, but when it came to inventing soda—which could have been figured out, in what, like an afternoon—they completely dropped the ball. What a disappointment. These idiots should be ashamed of themselves.

The Mayans get all sorts of praise for their work on mapping the stars and creating calendars that spanned millennia, yet somehow these ancient ignoramuses couldn’t even figure out how to fucking make soda . Inventing soda is so easy: It’s just carbonation, water, and flavor all mixed up together. The fact that the Mayans couldn’t figure that out is pretty embarrassing. Color us unimpressed, Mayans.
Perhaps the most respected among the ancient civilizations, the Greeks still receive acclaim today for their advancements in mathematics and democracy. Yet, for all the so-called “brilliant” work done by luminaries such as Plato or Pythagoras, none of them ever even had the imagination to think of Sprite. In all of the famous Socratic dialogues nobody ever conjured up the thought that people might want water to be bubbly and to taste like something? How do you fucking miss that? Get these dumbass Ancient Greeks out of our textbooks.

The bar must be pretty fucking low for a civilization like the Han Dynasty to be considered one of the most innovative given that these long-dead dweebs totally whiffed it on soda. Their scientists somehow figured out a method for detecting earthquakes, but on the soda front, nothing? Goddamnit. Soda is so easy to invent! What is wrong with the Han Dynasty? Just take a break from your bizarre cartography bullshit and make soda exist, you morons! It wouldn’t even have had to taste good! No one knew shit about soda back then, so they could have gotten away with some truly vile carbonated swill. At least then it would have actually made sense to call them an advanced civilization. Instead, they chose to languish in soda-free obscurity forever.

"Sure, Whatever: Ben Stiller Just Announced He’s Changing The Tagline Of ‘DodgeBall’ From ‘Grab Life By The Ball’ To ‘How A Couple Of Average Joes Saved The Day’","Heads up, DodgeBall fans. Ben Stiller’s made a pretty insignificant announcement concerning the hit 2004 sports comedy, and it will likely have no impact on the way you watch the film: As of today, Ben Stiller is changing DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story’s tagline from “Grab Life By The Ball” to “How A Couple Of Average Joes Saved The Day.”
Probably doesn’t matter, but that’s cool. Good for Ben Stiller, or whatever.
Early yesterday morning, Ben Stiller held a special press conference specifically to announce that anyone who possesses a DodgeBall DVD, Blu-ray, or poster that features the tagline “Grab Life By The Ball” should know that those are inferior, outdated versions of the film that no longer have his stamp of approval. The actor paused after saying that he’d obtained co-star Vince Vaughn’s blessing to do so, clearly under the impression that this was something people would get excited  over and not something that would be downright bizarre for Vince Vaughn or literally anyone at all to care about.

 Stiller concluded the press conference by removing a black cloth hanging over an easel on stage that displayed a side-by-side comparison of one DodgeBall poster with the old tagline, and one with the new tagline, the difference between the two entirely unimportant to everyone present except Ben Stiller.
You can bet this has DodgeBall fans everywhere saying, “Okay.”
If you somehow feel the need to know why this is happening at all, check out a portion of the transcript of Ben Stiller’s statement below:
After careful consideration, I am excited to announce that “How A Couple Of Average Joes Saved The Day” will be the new tagline for DodgeBall. This was the DodgeBall DVD cover that the world was meant to see. While the original tagline, “Grab Life By The Ball,” was an appropriate tagline for the film, as keen-eyed viewers will notice that it is a dodgeball-related twist on the inspirational phrase “grab life by the horns,” as well as a sexual innuendo that comedy audiences would be sure to appreciate, it is my firm belief as the film’s producer and co-star that “How A Couple Of Average Joes Saved The Day” is an even more fitting tagline, since it is a play on the protagonists’ team name, the Average Joes, as well as the film’s story about a group of underdogs who succeed against great odds. Our fans deserve nothing less than the best version of this film we could give them, so if you own a DodgeBall poster with the out-of-date tagline, I urge you to cross it out with a marker and write the new, correct tagline instead.

Wow. Now, the next time you see a re-run of DodgeBall on USA or whatever, you can appreciate that it’s been very slightly updated.

Medical Crisis: George H.W. Bush Has Been Rushed To The Hospital For Emergency Lip Gigantification Surgery,"A medical crisis is currently unfolding that’s left the life of one of the most prominent American statesmen hanging in the balance. According to major news outlets across the country, former President George H.W. Bush has been rushed to the hospital for emergency lip gigantification surgery.
Numerous sources have now confirmed that earlier today the former president was transported to the emergency room at Houston Methodist Hospital after doctors realized his lips needed to become insanely massive as soon as possible. For the past several hours, the 94-year-old has remained in critical condition while a team of doctors has worked frantically to make his lips the size of his head.

Fortunately, surgeons say that they’ve managed to enlarge the former president’s lips to the point where they obscure his entire face. This has helped place Bush in a more stable condition where his lips are absolutely gargantuan and look like two pool noodles plastered onto his mouth. Sadly, though, unless doctors can quadruple the size of Bush’s lips so that they engulf his entire head and droop down to the floor, they fear the worst.
After a year of health scares, here’s hoping that President Bush can once again bounce back and that doctors will be able to give him the giant lips he needs in order to survive.

The Power Of Community: This Town Rallied Around A Guy With A Big Snake To Check Out The Big Snake,"Get ready to have your faith in humanity restored, because this story about a whole community uniting behind one of its own is the happiest news you’ll read all day: This town just rallied around a guy with a big snake to check out the big snake!
Wow. You’ve got to admire this selfless display of togetherness and compassion.
Occidental, CA might appear to be your average small town, but when its residents heard that neighbor Michael Rudder had a big snake  and nobody was looking at it, they leaped into action to go look at his snake. One by one, neighbors, co-workers, and students all came running to give attention to the guy’s big snake, and even though no one asked to hold it, several people did get to touch it, and that’s incredible. It just goes to show how many people in one community can gawk at a neighbor’s big snake when they join together!

“I’ve been neighbors with Michael for pretty much my whole life, so when I heard he had a gigantic snake, I just knew then and there what I had to do, and that was go look at it,” said Ethan Marks, one of the dozens of big-hearted neighbors who wasted no time rushing to check out the large serpent. “I wouldn’t call us heroic. It was just the right thing to do to pull my kids out of school and start banging on my neighbors’ doors so we could all go look at this enormous snake and imagine it swallowing a deer whole. We all got to see the huge snake, and in the end, that’s what being a community is about.”
Uh, we’re not crying. You’re crying.
This is a truly inspiring story for coming together to look at a snake. Although some people left after an hour of looking at the snake, others stayed and looked at Michael’s snake until 3 a.m., and that is beautiful. If every town in America was like this, the world would be a better place. Community for the win!

"Beautiful: When The People In This Town Realized One Of Their Neighbors Didn’t Have Money To Buy A Car, They Didn’t Coordinate And All Got Cars For Him","For Indiana resident Lucas Watson, getting to work used to be a struggle. Since Lucas couldn’t afford his own car, he had to walk two hours every morning just to make it to his job. But that all changed when something incredible happened: As soon as the people in Lucas’ town realized that he didn’t have money to buy a car,  they didn’t coordinate and all got cars for him!
It warms your heart to see people looking out for each other like this!
 It must have been an incredible surprise for Lucas to walk outside one morning to find that his kindhearted neighbors had completely failed to communicate with each other and wound up purchasing him about 50 cars! Lucas probably never expected to have his own set of wheels, but thanks to his incredible neighbors who all assumed they were acting alone in buying him a car, he now has a small armada of cars to get him to work in 20 minutes flat.

This was a truly selfless gesture from some kindhearted and disorganized people, and now Lucas can be reminded how much his neighbors care about him every time he looks at the car in his driveway, the cluster of cars scattered around his front yard, and the several dozen remaining cars jamming up his street for two blocks in either direction.
Absolutely beautiful! It’s truly wonderful to see people in a community neglect any sort of logistical planning and all independently decide to help a neighbor in need in the same exact way.

Champion Of Animal Rights: PETA’s New Ad Campaign Features A Naked Bill Gates Begging People Not To Wear A Trench Coat Made Out Of Worms,"Animal rights activists must be feeling pretty pumped right now, because another big name just lent his voice to their cause: PETA just launched a new ad campaign featuring a naked Bill Gates begging people not to wear a trench coat made out of worms.
Awesome! Bill Gates already does so much for charity, and now he’s officially a champion of animal rights as well.

This week, PETA put up hundreds of billboards across the country featuring a fully nude Bill Gates posed against a somber black backdrop desperately begging people to not wear trench coats constructed entirely out of worms. The words “I’d rather go naked than wear worms” are emblazoned in cursive across each ad, below which, in smaller print, is an urgent plea from Gates reading, “Oh, God, please, please don’t wear a trench coat made from thousands and thousands of worms…  I am sobbing and wetting myself at just the thought of how awful it is… Why would anyone do this to the exquisite worms, the wet and intelligent tubes… WHY GOD?!?… THE WORMS ARE MY FRIENDS! THEY ARE NOT COAT FABRIC! THEY ARE MAMMALS JUST LIKE US! STOP DOING THIS, YOU BASTARDS! THE WORMS ARE SUFFERING AND MOOING IN PAIN!”
The powerful new ad campaign also features a 30-second commercial spot in which Gates uses his celebrity to drive home his anti-worm-cruelty message. In it, the billionaire philanthropist enters a public library fully nude, lifts a desktop computer monitor that a child is using up above his head, and then speaks in the direction of an overhead projector he believes to be a camera, saying, “Hello, I invented computers. Please shut up and do as I say. If you are planning on wearing a trench coat, do not wear one made of worms. Wear one made of a different animal, like a monkey or fish. If you wear one made of worms, I will go on a killing spree. Do not wear worm coats. You must obey me. I invented the iPhone. Thank you.” He then throws the desktop monitor into a recycling bin and leaves the library through an emergency exit.
Wow. What a moving message. Bill Gates definitely isn’t afraid to speak up for what he believes in, and hopefully these new ads will make anyone who’s considering wearing a trench coat made out of worms think twice. Kudos to both Bill and PETA for taking such an amazing stand against animal cruelty!

Did ‘Sesame Street’ Go Too Far With Its Episode Where Ernie Microwaves Himself While The Words ‘NO LESSON TODAY’ Flash On-Screen?,"Sesame Street has been delighting and educating children for decades, but the beloved show may have crossed the line yesterday with a controversial creative decision that has some parents furious. Did Sesame Street go too far with its episode where Ernie microwaves himself while the words “NO LESSON TODAY” flashed on the screen?
Within minutes of airing, hundreds of parents took to social media to express their anger over the contentious episode, which featured an hour-long sequence where Ernie walks into an empty kitchen, looks directly into the camera, and says, “Here’s my golden moment,” before climbing into the microwave, setting the timer for six hours, and shutting the door. Children had a full view of Ernie’s body rotating in the microwave while the words “NO LESSON TODAY” flashed on the screen. The message continued to flash as Ernie’s head began to swell and expand before ultimately bursting at the seams and gushing cotton filling.

While most of the online backlash to the hour-long episode was focused on Ernie slowly burning in the microwave, many viewers also expressed outrage and bewilderment at some of the additional segments in the episode, including a brief cutaway to Grover silently holding the human owner of a tobacco store at gunpoint while he filled a burlap sack with stolen cigars, and a segment in which Big Bird loudly recited an arbitrary string of numbers while tightly clutching a foam letter H. Even during these segments, footage of Ernie cooking himself in the microwave could be seen in a small inset in the corner of the screen, while the “NO LESSON TODAY” message continued to strobe brightly every few seconds.
If you’re a parent, tell us what you think! Did Sesame Street go too far, or was this just an innocent misstep?

Get Ready To Key His Car: 5 Signs Your Boyfriend Is Constipated Behind Your Back,"Every healthy relationship is built on a foundation of trust, so if your partner isn’t really as regular as he claims to be, it’s best that you find out now and move on. If any of these signs sound familiar, there’s a good chance your boyfriend is guilty of being constipated behind your back.
It’s easy to talk your way around this one and come up with excuses for why this is no big deal, but there’s no denying the obvious. If your boyfriend would rather stay in on the weekend eating bowls full of prunes than take you out somewhere special, it’s very likely because eating anything substantial makes him nauseous and he’s hoping prunes will get his system moving. This is textbook behavior for someone who’s hiding the fact that he’s constipated, and you should be wary.
Advertisement

Check his Instagram, Facebook, Twitter—check it all. If your boyfriend has been liking and commenting on dozens of intestinal doctors’ social media posts, then he’s almost certainly being constipated on the sly, and he’s practically begging to get caught. Ask yourself this: Would your boyfriend be so interested in gastroenterology if he were having regular bowel movements? Probably not. Time to dump his clogged-up ass.
This is an all too common excuse from lying boyfriends who are constipated behind their partner’s back. By making it seem like he’s shitting with such regularity and vigor that he has no physical energy for anything else, he’s cleverly distracting you from the real cause of his lack of bedroom passion, which is that his struggles with stool production frequently leave him too uneasy and bloated for lovemaking. Don’t put up with his lies. Key the asshole’s car and move on with your life.

Birds of a feather... well, you know the saying. If your boyfriend is always hanging around with guys who hardly ever take a dump, odds are he’s constipated, too. If your guy’s friends are always going on about how rarely they have satisfying bowel movements while he sits there biting his lip nervously, there’s your sign. Guys who take big healthy dumps throughout the day don’t hang out with backed-up dudes, and don’t let your man convince you otherwise. 
If you catch your boyfriend sleeping on the toilet, don’t listen to any of his bullshit excuses, because there is only one possible explanation: He was sitting on the toilet trying to void his bowels for so long that he eventually just dozed off. He is constipated, and you’ve caught him red-handed. So don’t lie to yourself, and whatever you do, don’t give him the benefit of doubt. It’s hard, but you need to accept that he’s a constipated son of a bitch, and you need to leave his sorry ass before he wastes any more of your time. You deserve someone who respects you and is willing to communicate openly and honestly with you about their shitting habits, and you shouldn’t settle for anything less. Find yourself someone who shits like a real man and don’t look back. You won’t regret it.

Inspiring Bravery: This Heroic Civilian Ran Right Up To A Burning Building,"Buckle up, because we’ve got a tale of heart-pounding bravery that’s guaranteed to inspire you: This heroic civilian ran right up to a burning building.Wow. This is what true courage looks like!
When Stephen Brewster noticed a three-story residential building engulfed in flame during his morning jog, he ignored the terror so many of us would feel in that situation and fearlessly charged right up outside the burning home. All it took was seeing the blazing roof and hearing panicked shouts from inside for Brewster to sprint over and stop 15 feet in front of the building’s door, and his incredible bravery kept him rooted firmly in place no matter how large the fire continued to grow. As smoke poured out the windows and sparks shot into the sky, Brewster’s courage never wavered—he stood directly in front of the raging inferno despite having no professional firefighting experience whatsoever, only pure determination and iron-willed grit.You just can’t fake that kind of moxie!“I had been totally paralyzed just watching the fire, and right as I was starting to worry that nobody was coming to help, out of nowhere this amazing guy comes tearing down the street and runs right up to the curb in front of the building,” said Jenna Daley, a neighbor who was lucky enough to witness Brewster’s heroic feat firsthand. For all eight nail-biting minutes it took for the fire department to show up, Brewster stood his ground out front with awe-inspiring mettle, bravely putting himself only yards away from the fire’s blistering heat and choking fumes. Even after the town’s fire trucks finally arrived on the scene, Brewster decided to see his job through to the end, and continued standing in front of the house until the last of the flames were finally extinguished.Bravo, Mr. Brewster! Your dauntless courage in running right up to a blazing house fire and standing immediately outside is a shining example to us all.

"‘Trust Us, You Don’t Want Our Plan B’: GOP Lawmakers Are Trying To Win Support For Brett Kavanaugh By Insisting That He’s Pretty Much The Friendliest Sexual Predator They’ve Got","With two sexual assault allegations out against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in addition to persistent questions about his qualifications from Senate Democrats, the Republican Party has taken action to defend the candidate it believes to be best suited for the position: GOP lawmakers are trying to win support for Kavanaugh by insisting that he’s pretty much the friendliest sexual predator they’ve got.
This is a clear sign that the GOP isn’t going to just sit back and watch accusations against a sexual predator like Judge Kavanaugh rack up without defending his integrity.

In a meeting yesterday on the Senate floor held after the release of a New Yorker story chronicling the second assault allegation against the Supreme Court nominee, GOP leaders argued that you’d be hard-pressed to find a friendlier sexual predator than Brett Kavanaugh, adding that, considering some of the other perverts they could’ve nominated in his stead, Democrats should be thanking their lucky stars to have such a smiley and approachable dirtbag up for confirmation.
“Whether he’s dropping by your office to ask how your day’s going or just giving you a cheery wave when he sees you in the hallway, Judge Kavanaugh has got to be the friendliest sexual predator we have,” stated Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. “He’s the rare breed of molester who will go out of his way to give you a compliment when you need it most, which is why he deserves a seat on the Supreme Court.”
“As far as sexually depraved candidates go, we could’ve brought much, much worse to the table, and, to be honest, Democrats really dodged a bullet with Judge Kavanaugh,” McConnell added. “Seriously, trust us, you don’t want our plan B.”

GOP lawmakers continued to highlight just how special a warm-hearted sexual assailant like Kavanaugh is, noting that, out of all the sexual predators they could’ve nominated for the role, he by far offers the closest approximation of human decency.
“Judge Kavanaugh is the kind of person who always remembers everyone’s birthday, and those trying to block his confirmation should know that such thoughtfulness is not a quality you’ll find in any other individual we’d nominate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy,” said Iowa Congressman Steve King. “Yes, Judge Kavanaugh might’ve done a little groping in his formative years, but he’s grown into a kind and considerate man who never fails to brighten up a room. That is not the case for the other men who have been considered for nomination. No siree. Those men are stone-cold predators, evil to the bone. Next to them, Judge Kavanaugh might as well be Mr. Rogers.”
Representative King then visibly shuddered.
With a public hearing between Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford scheduled for later this week, this is proof that the Republicans aren’t backing down from defending one of the nicest sexual predators in their party anytime soon.

Stunning Revelation: A 10-Year Sleep Study At Princeton Has Revealed That Dreaming Is Your Brain’s Way Of Thinking About Weird Stuff,"Get ready for some mind-blowing news from the neuroscience world: An exhaustive decade-long study into human sleep has revealed that dreaming is your brain’s way of thinking about weird things.
Wow! This is a seriously groundbreaking discovery.
The landmark study, conducted by a team of researchers at Princeton University, utilized cutting-edge imaging technologies to closely examine the brain activity of hundreds of sleeping test subjects, ultimately determining that dreams are essentially the unconscious brain’s way of stitching together wacky thoughts in the middle of the night. By analyzing so-called “posterior cortical hot zones” of individuals experiencing REM sleep, researchers found that when people aren’t dreaming, their brains rarely think about bizarre things like having all your teeth fall out while being chased down a hallway by a very slow tornado, whereas when people are dreaming, these things are pretty much all the brain wants to think about.

“Our scans showed that while humans are sleeping, the brain draws on memories of acquaintances and experiences to come up with weird stuff and then dwell on that weird stuff, and that’s what dreams are,” the study concluded, adding that the brain generally refrains from thinking about normal stuff during dreams because the designated time period for thinking about normal stuff is daytime. “Beyond that, dreams have absolutely no significance or purpose.”
Incredible. What a truly astonishing breakthrough.
The causes and mechanics of dreaming have remained a mystery up until now, but thanks to hardworking neuroscientists, we now know that dreams are just a visual representation of the all the weird shit your brain is thinking about. Science FTW!

Heartbreaking: The Thing You Want Is All The Way Over There,"In this day and age, the daily onslaught of awful news you read about is just plain brutal and unrelenting. We’re sorry to announce that this story is no exception. Here’s a bleak reminder that the world is often a cruel, unjust place: The thing you want is all the way over there.
Simply heartbreaking. This is the type of terrible tragedy you hear about happening to other people but never imagined actually happening to yourself.

Tragically, even though the thing you want is something you’d like to have right now, the heartbreaking reality is that in order to get it, you would have to get up and go all the way over there, which is enough to make you question whether going on living is even worth it at this point. This horrible situation forces us to question how a just and loving God could allow the thing you want to be in one place and have you be in a different place, even though you’d like the thing to be in the same place as you since you want it.
In dark times like these, the love and support of friends and family are about all that can help pull you through the feelings of hopelessness and despair.
All the more devastating, experts have confirmed that reaching your arm all the way out toward the thing you want will not be enough to get the thing you want to be in your hands, which is a truly devastating blow for you since you want the thing. Getting up and going to go get the thing is reportedly the only way the thing you want is ever going to be with you over where you are right now. And as if this world hadn’t already been cruel enough, it appears as though the thing you want will tauntingly remain clearly in your field of vision, leaving you to wonder what it might be like if the thing was closer to you, and making it nearly impossible for you to ever fully move on and live your life without thinking about having the thing in your hands.

At this point, all you can do is accept that you are now living in a world where the thing you want is all the way over there, and unless someone comes walking into the room who you can shout at and ask to bring the thing over to you, you’re going to have to learn to live without it or stand up and go all the way over there and get it. Either way, the awful task placed upon you by this cold and uncaring universe is to now pick up the shattered pieces of your life and try to move forward.",NaN,2018-09-25T10:45:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--m6VPFxt8--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/bo5xporfbrzu0wpki4ee.jpg",Fake

Exciting For Them: A Team Of Archaeologists Has Just Uncovered A Rock That Kind Of Looks Like Their Friend,"In a discovery that won’t have much significance for the world at large but is really cool for the people involved, a team of archeologists from Oxford University announced today that they had discovered a rock that kind of looks like their friend.
Nice! This is such an exciting discovery for anyone who knows the guy these archeologists are talking about.

“While excavating the remains of a Bronze Age village on the southern coast of Norway, our researchers discovered an 800-year-old igneous rock that looks almost exactly like our friend Jason, which we thought was pretty dang neat,” reads the report, which was published yesterday in the Journal Of World Prehistory under the title “On The Extraction And Sustained Chemical And Compositional Analysis Of Cool Rock That Looks Like Our Buddy Jason.” “While the rock in question has very little significance from a geological or historical standpoint, there is strong evidence that anyone who knows Jason is going to take one look at it and be absolutely tickled by how much it looks like him.”
Wow! To a very limited number of people, this is a seriously cool discovery.
While experts in the field largely agree that this will have no effect on archaeology in any way, they all express their sincere congratulations to these lucky Oxford researchers for finding a rock that looks so much like a guy they know. Here’s hoping that everyone who knows this Jason guy gets a chance to take a look at that rock!

Poor Kid: Eddie Vedder Just Said Something Rude About Donald Trump So Now This 8-Year-Old Has To Listen To His Dad Yell About Eddie Vedder For 2 Weeks,"Well, this isn’t going to be fun. It looks like the next couple of weeks will probably be a bit rough for 8-year-old Jayden Corlett, because his dad found out that Eddie Vedder said something rude about Donald Trump and now he’s got to endure his dad constantly complaining about Eddie Vedder for the foreseeable future.
Yikes. Hang in there, little guy.
Jayden’s dad discovered the Pearl Jam singer’s slight at the president from a meme posted on a Facebook page called “Conservative News Daily,” which paraphrased a Rolling Stone interview where Vedder said, “I’ve never been more ashamed of the direction my country is headed. Fuck Donald Trump.” Since the moment Jayden’s dad saw the quote, his anger toward Vedder has been out of control, and Jayden—who didn’t know who Eddie Vedder was when his dad first started ranting about him and still doesn’t really—has had to suffer through nonstop rants about how Eddie Vedder “sounds like a goat,” how “Soundgarden was the only grunge band worth a shit anyway,” and how “celebrities like Eddie Vedder should stick to singing and dancing.”
Advertisement

While initially there was hope that the anger might be short-lived, it quickly became clear that the anti-Vedder rants would have to be endured on an everyday basis, with the most recent outburst coming earlier today when Pearl Jam’s “Jeremy” came on the radio as Jayden’s dad was driving him to school.
“Goat Boy is entitled to his beliefs, but this isn’t about politics,” Jayden’s father explained to him with muted hostility as Jayden silently played Angry Birds on his Kindle in the back seat. “It’s about respecting the office of president and not being vulgar. I don’t remember any conservative celebrities feeling the need to insult Obama using language like that. Celebrities wonder why everyone hates them.”
Poor kid. No child should have to experience their dad constantly bitching about Eddie Vedder.

Unfortunately, with no shortage of celebrities making disparaging statements about the president, Jayden is probably going to be subjected to his father’s diatribes for as long as Trump is in office. We can only hope that Jayden learns to block him out thoroughly enough to avoid any long-term trauma.",NaN,2018-09-24T11:30:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--N_fySxsM--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/qvjarapnckip84n4z1pt.jpg",Fake
Game Changer: Blue Apron Will Now Pick Up Your Finished Meals And Show Them To Your Ex To Prove You Have Your Shit Together,"If you’ve been on the fence about Blue Apron, an amazing new addition to the grocery delivery service just might convince you to try out a subscription.

Why didn’t this exist sooner! This is definitely a total game changer. 
Starting this week, any time you finish cooking a meal from Blue Apron, the company will send an employee to your home to pick up your meal and drive it to your ex’s house and start waving the food around in their face. They’ll tell your ex that you cooked this meal all by yourself using Blue Apron, which means that you have your life together enough to find time to cook and to afford a Blue Apron subscription.

Absolutely awesome. If you’ve recently broken up with someone, this definitely seems like something you’d love. Whether you’re cooking a delicious cod with a miso glaze, or asiago-smothered chicken with roasted zucchini, someone is going to come carry it out of your kitchen and shove in front of your ex’s face so they know just how well you’re doing with your fancy meal-prep programs and your functioning kitchen.

"5 Of Your Friends Who Are Wearing Reasonable Dresses To Homecoming, So I’m Not Sure Why You Can’t Wear Something A Little More Sensible","“I talked to some of their parents, and it sounds like your friends are all going to wear homecoming dresses that are a nice, reasonable length. I’m sure they’re all going to look lovely. Here are five of the girls who have pretty, classy-looking outfits planned out—why can’t you find something a little more appropriate to wear, like them?”

I already called Alexandria’s mom, and she said they found something really nice at Talbots. Alexandria’s always wearing stylish clothes—don’t you want to wear something like what she picked out? Her dress has more fabric than the one you tried on from Bebe, and the price is more reasonable, too. I know you liked that Bebe one, but I think it was a little low-cut. Maybe it would have looked okay with a camisole underneath it. You’re going to wear some pantyhose under your dress, right?

Natalie had such a pretty dress that she wore to your Sweet 16, don’t you remember? That navy one that went to her knee with the tie in the back. That looked nice. Not like that Nicole girl whose dress basically looked painted on. I mean, she wasn’t leaving too much to the imagination. And by the way, those pumps you tried to pick out aren’t going to be comfortable. What about some nice kitten heels, like the ones Natalie wore? Natalie’s cool. If they’re good enough for Natalie, I don’t understand why you have such a problem with them.

Olivia’s mom sent me a picture of her dress, and it has some nice cap sleeves that I think would really suit you. I like the way Olivia does her makeup, too. Nothing too dramatic. Why don’t you try that instead of all that eyeliner you sometimes wear? And speaking of Olivia, her dad said that he was going to drive some of the girls to the bowling alley after the dance is done, and then from there everyone can watch a movie in their den. Wouldn’t that be fun? Her mom said she was going to get snacks and everything, and some nail polish and spa stuff for you girls to use.

The faculty chaperones are dressing up too, and I think Mrs. Welty’s dress is perfect. She showed it to me in the parking lot after the PTA meeting. You know, knee-length dresses are actually more flattering than shorter dresses are. They look good on everyone’s figure. Why don’t you think about wearing something that covers a little more skin?

Kerry’s dress has long sleeves. She’s going to have a great time. And it’s not the kind of dress where the sleeves go down further than the hem, like what your brother’s homecoming date wore a few years ago. Boys can tell, you know, when girls are just looking for attention. That’s the way it is. Why don’t you try on one of my dresses? We can get that maroon one taken in if you want.

Incredible: This Amazing Artist Depicted What John Lennon Would Look Like If He Were Alive Today And Far Away,"When John Lennon was shot outside his home on December 8, 1980, the world lost one of its most talented and beloved artists. Though we may never know what things would have been like if Lennon’s life hadn’t been cut so tragically short, a talented young illustrator has found a pretty cool way to give fans a glimpse at what could have been: This artist depicted what John Lennon would look like if he were alive today and very far away!
Wow. It is truly surreal to see John Lennon looking so old, so lifelike, and so incredibly far away after all this time.

Combining her artistic abilities with advanced age-prediction technology, Los Angeles-based artist Grace Marsh has seemingly brought the music icon back to life and as far away as we’ve ever seen him. Thanks to her impeccable work, Beatlemaniacs can now strain their eyes to see a tiny 78-year-old version of John Lennon’s face, imagining a universe in which Mark David Chapman never fired that fatal bullet, and then at some point Lennon decided to go stand at the other end of a big meadow or mall parking lot. You have to wonder how Paul or Ringo might feel looking at this lifelike image of their old friend, wishing they could call out to him, only to realize he can’t hear because he’s way in the distance, to the point where barely even a friendly wave would register to the naked eye.
Simply amazing. It’s truly incredible how one simple picture of a beloved musician almost entirely out of view due to how far away he is can be so powerful, and so bittersweet. We like to think that Lennon is smiling down from a better place, totally impressed with Marsh’s work. RIP, John—we miss you!

"America’s Middle Class Is Being Erased By Income
Inequality Like The Scientists Erased From Existence After The Clone-otaur Changes
The Past In My Screenplay ‘Chronotaur 3: Hoof Of History’","These days, ordinary people are struggling to make ends meet while the rich grow ever richer. Our economy is tilted in favor of millionaires and billionaires, thanks to unfair laws that let plutocrats exploit their workers and pay almost nothing in taxes. Unless we take immediate action to fix income inequality, it’s clear that America’s middle class will disappear like the scientists who are erased from existence after the Clone-otaur alters the timeline of the universe in my un-produced screenplay Chronotaur 3: Hoof Of History.
The culprit is trickle-down economics, the phony theory that if we simply hand more cash to the ultra-rich they’ll somehow create good jobs, the way a sinister cloning program uses stolen DNA from the Chronotaur to create an evil genetic doppelgänger known and feared as the Clone-otaur. Moviegoers will be familiar with the Chronotaur from the previous films in the Chronotaur trilogy, Chronotaur: Labyrinth Of Time and Chronotaur 2: Thread Of Destiny, as soon as my scripts are optioned by studios and released in theaters everywhere, but one thing viewers might be surprised to learn is that the richest 1 percent of Americans now own as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent combined. Yep, income inequality has gotten that bad.

Congress should be trying to fix this obscene disparity, but to please their donors politicians instead pass tax cuts for the rich while slashing social services. As a result, the wealth gap continues to grow like a Clone-otaur fetus floating inside a cloning tank, lowering the standard of living for working-class families just so millionaires can afford a second mansion.
Fortunately, the solution to income inequality isn’t as complicated as the Time Maze, the infinite extra-dimensional labyrinth patrolled by the Chronotaur that can be used to reach any coordinate in space-time by those capable of navigating its ever-shifting corridors. We must split the economic pie so that the rich pay their fair share of taxes, the way Dr. Raymond Childress and his wife, Dr. Elizabeth Childress, evenly divided their lifespans at the end of Chronotaur 2, and in doing so managed to postpone but not prevent the predestined, fatal car crash that Raymond initially time-traveled to alter in Labyrinth Of Time. Although the scientist couple dies during the gripping opening scene of Chronotaur 3, splitting their lifespan energy bought them an extra 20 years together, two decades as blissful as the well-paying jobs that once sustained a robust middle class.
What ever happened to the American dream? Today it’s increasingly out of reach for most people to own a home, retire at a reasonable age, or raise your daughter into a strong female protagonist like Virginia Childress, a beautiful, brilliant, and empowered MIT grad student that movie audiences will immediately connect with.
Advertisement

After the deaths of her parents, Virginia inherits their shares of Quantum Consortium stock and takes over her father’s position as CEO of the company. Under the wise leadership of Virginia’s father, the once-nefarious Quantum Consortium had been reformed into an ethical institute for time research, ceasing its misguided attempts to kill the Chronotaur in order to change the past without interference from the half-bovine cosmic guardian.
It’s important to remember that in the 1950s the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent on income over $300,000, and this high tax rate encouraged corporations to reinvest their profits into paying employees a living wage rather than gifting lavish bonuses to executives like Virginia, who secretly worries that she cannot live up to her parents’ impressive legacy. Sadly, in the 1980s the Reagan administration enacted supply-side economic policies that gradually eroded American prosperity, leading us to the mess we’re in today.
The GOP pretends that high taxes on the rich are as terrifying as the tagline “Double the Chronotaur. Infinity-times the horror,” when in fact progressive taxation is what allowed the middle class to flourish.

In our new gilded age, corporate moguls pocket most of the profits while leaving only scraps for the workers that actually created that wealth. When billionaires are paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries, it doesn’t take a mysterious transmission from deep within the Time Maze warning you to investigate the file for Project Chronosome on the Quantum Consortium’s encrypted server to tell you that something is seriously wrong with this picture. After hacking her way into the computer, Virginia discovers that a rogue faction within the consortium, led by the beautiful but wicked chrono-geneticist Sirena LeMort, has been covertly working for years to spawn the Clone-otaur.
Despite all the evidence to the contrary, Republicans continue to insist that a “rising tide lifts all boats.” Well, right now the only boats are one-percenters’ yachts, and middle-class Americans are left floundering in the water like Virginia desperately fighting to stop the Clone-otaur from being unleashed.
 To get a better understanding of the way the Reagan administration’s policies of deregulated markets led to the staggering income inequality we’re faced with today, take a look at these pages from Chronotaur 3:

Advertisement

My point is that if the Robo-Chronotaur can learn the error of its ways over eons of algorithmic contemplation, then why does America keep repeating the disproven tactic of trickle-down economics?
You’d think that Republicans wouldn’t get re-elected when their tax cuts fail to help constituents, but they’re kept in office by keeping voters as misinformed as Virginia when she can’t tell the Chronotaur and Clone-otaur apart as they tussle. Just like middle-class American voters, Virginia accidentally shoots the Chronotaur by mistake with a photonic entanglement bazooka. This disperses the Chronotaur’s lifespan energy, making him too elderly and feeble to fight, and shatters the universe into hundreds of parallel realities called the Impossiworlds, where the laws of chance are askew and the only thing that is probable is the improbable, which is quite similar to how America is now more divided than ever.
Sadly, many working-class Republicans have been tricked into voting against their own best interests, like foolish movie studios that pass on a trilogy of screenplays even though they’re surefire hits that would blow up at the box office.
Advertisement

It seems absurd that a poor coal miner in Appalachia could believe that they’d benefit from tax breaks for fat-cat tycoons, or that the Impossiworlds are each themed after different genres of fiction, but as the Fate Cow explains to Virginia, “Once the constraints of physics crumble away, every dream and nightmare will be made flesh.” Each pocket dimension is ruled over by a twisted version of the Chronotaur formed from a fragment of its divided lifespan energy, including the 1920s-mobster dimension ruled by the Crime-otaur, the medieval dimension ruled by the Crownotaur, the zombie-apocalypse dimension ruled by the Corpse-otaur, the pirate dimension ruled by the Captainotaur, the cowboy dimension ruled by the Caballerotaur, the sports dimension ruled by the Coachotaur, the opera dimension ruled by the Contraltotaur, the animation dimension ruled by the Cartoonotaur, the Victorian England dimension ruled by the Constable-otaur, and many dozens of others.  These Chronotaur variants are powerful foes my protagonists must defeat to collect their stolen lifespan energy in order to mend the fractured multiverse and revive the Chronotaur so it can fight the Clone-otaur, but it would be a mistake to also treat those deluded blue-collar GOP voters as enemies, because ultimately we’re going to need their help to kick out politicians that don’t take action on income inequality.
Although it’s tempting to vilify misguided conservative voters, that’s exactly what the robber barons are counting on. The banksters want the left and right to keep squabbling amongst themselves, instead of working together like the tie-in video game I’ve designed, Chronotaur The Game: Schism Of Centuries, and the accompanying mobile app, Chronotaur Tap!: Labyrinth Of Sprinting, which will automatically sync data to let you transfer items between games.
When you look at the way our nation’s greedy financial elites pit the working class against each other, it’s hard not to compare them to the Primordial Hogs, malevolent chaotic entities that existed before eternity and have forever sought to unmake the Time Maze and impose disorder upon the cosmos. Although the hogs of chaos are the antithesis of all that is holy and good, Democrats could take a page from how, during the Middle Ages, the Primordial Hogs enacted their dark will on Earth by seducing the LeMort family with whispered promises of power and persuading them into founding the Crusade Consorters, a legion of ruthless knights that were the precursor organization that would eventually become the Quantum Consortium, which proves that if you patiently speak to your constituents with respect they’ll listen to what you have to say and show up to the polls when it counts.

Instead of lobbing insults like “redneck” or dismissing rural areas as “flyover country,” liberals must try to convince conservatives to join the call for another New Deal. In our polarized society, finding consensus may seem as hopeless as the final battle when the Clone-otaur kills the Chronotaur by absorbing all of its lifespan energy, decaying the valiant defender of time into a skeleton that dissolves to dust. When she sees the noble Chronotaur disintegrate before her eyes, Sirena LeMort laughs in triumph, but her victory is illusory because, in a stunning twist, it’s ultimately revealed that the Clone-otaur is actually the younger form of the Chronotaur, because the Chronotaur is a clone of itself, so that by creating the Clone-otaur to slay the Chronotaur, this is, in fact, the origin of the Chronotaur that created the Chronotaur in the first place.
Ironically, it turns out that the age-old quest of the Primordial Hogs to manipulate humanity into eradicating the Chronotaur backfired the same way that trying to stimulate the economy by giving tax cuts to upper-income brackets is counterproductive because the rich simply stash the extra money in offshore bank accounts instead of spending it, as Reagan and his economic disciples so adamantly attest, to bolster the market and enrich the middle class.
We may not be able to convince everyone, but if Democrats can persuade even a small slice of Republicans to support progressive taxation that funds a Scandinavian-style social safety net, those moderate voters may prove to be as valuable an ally as Genghis Khan #457, who overcomes his clone brainwashing to do the right thing and trip the mind-controlled juvenile Chronotaur by riding a war pony tied to a rope in circles around the Chronotaur’s mighty legs to ensnare its ankles, saving our heroes from its deadly charge. The reprieve is momentary, since the Chrontoaur easily bursts through the rope, but seeing the Genghis Khan switch sides inspires Lt. Jaxon to also follow his conscience and fire an electromagnetic railgun through the Chronotaur’s skull. The injury immediately heals thanks to the Chronotaur’s regenerative anti-entropic field, but the mind-control chip in its brain is destroyed by the projectile as it passes through, freeing the cosmic guardian to turn against Sirena LeMort and unravel her dastardly scheme.

But don’t expect America’s plutocratic overlords to be defeated that easily. They’re corrupting our democracy by purchasing media outlets to unfairly influence elections, thanks to the disastrous Citizens United ruling by the Supreme Court declaring that money is speech. Likewise, once her Clone-otaur plot is defeated, Sirena turns to equally desperate measures by injecting an untested serum of Chronotaur DNA into her spine, mutating herself into an unstoppable genetically perfect monster that’s the ultimate endpoint of evolution called the Omegataur.
Virginia, in dismay, asks, “Sirena, what have you done to yourself?” and when the Omegataur replies, “I have become God,” you can recognize the callous addiction to power that motivates the United States’ billionaire class seeking to enslave American workers in a cycle of inescapable poverty and debt.
However, like our rapidly eroding democratic norms, Sirena’s cellular matrix is incapable of containing the limitless energy of the chronosome. The villain screams in horror as she begins metastasizing outward in an ever-expanding, miles-wide sphere of churning flesh, fur, hooves, and horns that threatens to grow until it consumes all matter in the universe. Even the Chronotaur is unable to stop the imminent bio-apocalypse.

Yet even when all seems lost in my screenplay, I still have hope for our country. Across the United States, we’re seeing a resurgent wave of civic engagement in protests and town halls as people demand a more equitable society. Americans are finally speaking up, like Virginia’s deceased parents do when they miraculously appear before her as translucent glowing spirits. Raymond and Elizabeth explain they exist in this ghostly form thanks to the Second Rule of Time Travel, which states that lifespan energy cannot be destroyed by altering the past, just as the First Rule of Time Travel ensures additional lifespan energy cannot be created to save or extend lives. Therefore, when the scientists had their lives prematurely truncated by the Clone-otaur, it freed their unused lifespan energy to be reborn as Time Seraphs, angelic protectors tasked with fixing the damage caused by temporal meddling, and they also tell Virginia how proud of her they are.
Sadly, this emotional family reunion is as brief as the wealthy are rich.
In one of the most noble acts of self-sacrifice in cinema history, the spectral Raymond and Elizabeth use up all of their remaining lifespan energy in order to power a tachyon rifle that Virginia reversed the polarity of in order to convert it into an anti-Darwin ray that rewinds Sirena’s expansion, causing her to evolve backwards into a human, but the villainess’ relief is short-lived as she then devolves into a Homo erectus, then a monkey, then a lizard, then a fish, descending the evolutionary ladder until she finally disperses into a cloud of bacteria as numerous as the participants in the grassroots political revolution about to sweep Washington.

No Excuse: This Kid Who’s Rich Enough To Have A Full-Blown Basketball Court In His Backyard Is By Far The Shittiest Basketball Player On His Team ,"Here’s a story of squandered privilege that will almost certainly leave you shaking your head: This kid who’s rich enough to have a full-blown basketball court in his backyard is by far the shittiest basketball player on his team.

With a regulation-size court right in his backyard, complete with NBA-quality equipment and floodlights for after-dark play, you’d think that 11-year-old rich kid Adam Belnap would be among the best players in his fifth-grade league, if not the best. But nothing could be further from the truth. Because Adam, despite having 24/7 access to the same kind of practice setup as the pros, has quickly earned a reputation as the player on his team you absolutely do not pass the ball to, as he’ll immediately find some dumb-fuck way to blow the possession. Though his parents shelled out $8,000 over the summer to send him to Chris Paul’s weeklong youth basketball intensive, Adam somehow still struggles with basic ball-handling and shooting techniques, as evidenced by his first game after returning from camp, where he went 0 for 6 on free throws and racked up eight turnovers.

It’s fucking embarrassing. When Adam shows up to games decked out in his $150 KD 11 shoes and shooting sleeve, chewing on those expensive Gatorade performance gummies, opposing teams instantly assume that Adam’s going to be the hardest player to guard. But, nope, he’s a total pushover. Even Derrick, the poor kid who wears blue jeans to every practice because he can’t afford any basketball stuff, is leagues ahead of Adam, because unlike his wealthy-ass teammate, he doesn’t shoot in a panic every time he enters the paint out of fear of taking a little contact. It’s honestly inexcusable that Adam, a kid whose parents pay for him to have weekly one-on-one training sessions with a former Duke player, is routinely getting benched in favor of Derrick, a kid whose parents are rumored to be in jail. It’s Derrick, for fuck’s sake!
Shit’s weak.
For someone whose parents have literally given him every possible opportunity to develop into the next Steph Curry, Adam has no excuse to be chucking bricks. At the very least he should be on a travel team, but clearly that’s not happening any time soon. The kid just sucks ass, and he’s got no one to blame but himself.

Catastrophic Misstep: The Reptile Guy At This School Assembly Just Handed A Huge Snake To The Most Straight-Up Insane Kid In Fifth Grade,"Here’s a developing situation that could take a turn for the worse at any second: Everyone is bracing themselves for total disaster after the reptile guy at this Westhaven Elementary School assembly made the mistake of handing a huge snake to the most straight-up insane kid in fifth grade. 
Oh god. This is definitely not going to end well. 
In all fairness, the professional animal handler from Reptiles! Reptiles! Reptiles! had no way of knowing that 10-year-old Aaron Bridges is basically a mini psychopath, but Aaron’s sharklike teeth, buzzed hair, and numerous Band-Aid-free scabs probably should have tipped him off before he casually passed over the enormous, fanged serpent that Aaron is now holding. Aaron once had his entire backpack confiscated and still managed to construct a sharp, anatomically correct penis out of 18 unfolded paper clips that same day, so the fact that this MacGyver of chaos now has full control of a literal python is nothing short of terrifying. In fact, Aaron’s teacher Mr. Kleinman has been white-knuckling his chair in the back of the cafeteria ever since Aaron was handed the snake—but all the little devil has done so far is make threatening eye contact with second-grader Martin Janiewicz, so there’s no real reason to punish him yet. Regardless, after the incident last month when Aaron hid his dad’s lighter in his lunchbox and tried to burn the word “ass” into a girls’ bathroom stall, there’s not a chance any of the adults in the room are letting their guard down.

What a mess. Aaron just announced that the snake’s name is now “Gaylord” and started laughing hysterically, so it seems like it’s only a matter of time before he thinks of some way to wreak havoc with his new reptilian friend. Here’s hoping the handler senses danger and takes the snake back ASAP, or else everyone is no doubt in for some kind of unimaginable horror.",NaN,2018-09-20T14:40:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--KSAGeE39--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/yag9trcolmvur8r8f37z.jpg",Fake
"Ultimate Humiliation: This 7th-Grade Boy’s Mom Made Him Go Into Victoria’s Secret With Her While She Shopped For Thongs, And All His Classmates Were Watching From The Auntie Anne’s Across The Mall","If you happened to be shopping at the Maplewood Mall in Elko, NV yesterday, there’s a good chance you saw every middle schooler’s worst nightmare playing out in real-time: This seventh-grade boy’s mom made him go into Victoria’s Secret with her while she shopped for thongs, and all of his classmates watched it happen from the Auntie Anne’s across the mall.
Poor kid. He’s not gonna live this one down for a long, long time.
After taking him to JCPenney yesterday to buy some new dress pants for his upcoming orchestra concert, middle schooler Caleb Murray’s mom decided to stop into Victoria’s Secret to shop for some intimates since they were already at the mall anyway and she didn’t want to make a second trip. Much to Caleb’s horror, his mom then immediately beelined for a display featuring some of the store’s raciest garments, holding up various thongs, negligees, and bras to her body while saying things like “Ooo, your father will really enjoy this one” and “This will give me some much-needed lift.” If this weren’t already embarrassing enough for the 13-year-old, things only got worse when he heard uproarious laughter coming from nearby and realized that dozens of popular kids from his school had been watching the whole scene unfold from the Auntie Anne’s location across the way.

“Doesn’t Mommy look nice, sweetie?” asked Caleb’s mother as she emerged from a dressing room wearing an incredibly revealing satin slip, much to the delight of the boy’s sneering classmates, many of whom had taken out their cell phones to document the scene in crystal-clear 1080p to later post on social media. “I think it’s a bit tight, but that’s because I’m on my monthly right now and my breasts are a little swollen. The fit should be a little better once I finish my cycle.”
“Whoopsie!” she added as one of the garment’s straps slipped off her shoulder, momentarily revealing her entire right breast, prompting cheers and screams of glee from the gallery of teen spectators. 
The profoundly upsetting saga was only just beginning for Caleb, who was then tasked with helping his mom lace up the back of an alarmingly risqué bustier she was trying on, as well as assisting her in fastening the garters for a matching pair of sheer panties. As the humiliated boy worked to secure the titillating ensemble to his 48-year-old mother’s body, more and more kids from Caleb’s school showed up to gawk at the spectacle, to the point where they could no longer fit inside the Auntie Anne’s, forcing the crowd—now numbering in the dozens—to move even closer to the Victoria’s Secret entrance. Although Caleb was mortified beyond belief by the looming presence of his jeering, snickering peers, his mother remained utterly oblivious, too focused on finding the perfect sensual getup for her upcoming anniversary trip to Scottsdale with her husband.

“Hmm, I think these cups are running a little large,” muttered Caleb’s mother to herself, emerging from the fitting room in a loose-hanging leopard-spotted corset, eliciting raucous cheers and applause from the herd of adolescents staring transfixed from the store’s entrance. “Normally I’m a 32DD, but I think I might have to go down a size on this one.”
“Can you go grab Mommy a 34D?” she continued, her attire leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination for the massive throng of wide-eyed teens, the very same teens who will be determining her son’s fate, socially speaking, for the remainder of his childhood years and whose unempathetic, still-developing brains are neurally hardwired to respond to such a scene with only the purest, most uninhibited expressions of cruelty and bullying. “Just crawl under the fitting room door and hand it to me—I can’t come out and get it because I’m completely naked.”
As the red-faced Caleb dutifully went to retrieve the different-sized corset, the traumatic situation escalated even further, as all three of his biggest crushes—Abby, Chloe, and Makayla—appeared front and center of the crowd of his peers and proceeded to point and giggle derisively at him, all but obliterating his romantic prospects for the foreseeable future.  Adding insult to injury, it was at this moment that he looked down and discovered to his great horror and confusion that an involuntary erection had sprung up beneath his blue jeans—an astonishingly ill-timed occurrence that did not go unnoticed by his peers, who then immediately broke out in a merry chant of “Boner Boy! Boner Boy!,” a new nickname that will almost certainly now follow him until he goes off to college.

Sheesh. That is absolutely brutal.
It’s hard to think of a more devastating sequence of events that could befall a middle-school boy, but here’s hoping Caleb can find a way to bounce back. He’s got a small solo in the orchestra concert next week, so maybe that will help him win back some of the social clout he lost in this disastrous outing to the mall. Hang in there, buddy, and good luck going back to school!

"Bad News, Gamers: Nintendo Revealed That
In The Next ‘Animal Crossing’ Your Character Can’t Find Work And Stays Home
Playing ‘Animal Crossing’ During Their Unemployment","The next Animal Crossing game is hotly anticipated, but fans might want to keep their excitement in check. Nintendo just revealed that in the forthcoming Switch installment, your character won’t be able to find work and will stay at home playing Animal Crossing during their unemployment.
This a huge bummer for gamers hoping for more of the fun jobs and delivery missions that villagers would give you in previous Animal Crossing games.
Advertisement

In a newly released teaser trailer for the game, we’re shown a clip of the businessman raccoon Tom Nook turning down the player’s desperate request for employment, telling them it’s a tight job market and he already has more applicants than he needs. Without a paycheck, the player is unable to buy their own house, and instead moves back in with their parents and plays Animal Crossing in their childhood room all day. If that’s not already discouraging enough, due to your character’s financial difficulties, they are not able to afford a Switch console and will be limited to playing the 2008 version of Animal Crossing on their Wii.
Although there is still an activity-filled town to explore, your character will rarely have the emotional energy needed to venture out and about, making it hard to pursue hobbies like fishing or bug collecting. It’ll no longer be possible to purchase clothing or furniture, because your character has no source of income and is deferring on their student loans. Fortunately, despite being depressed and broke, your avatar will still be able to find comfort in zoning out with their old Animal Crossing save file when they’re not busy mailing out résumés or helping their elderly parents with household chores in exchange for free rent.
This announcement is a bit of a letdown for anyone hoping for new and exciting Animal Crossing features, but if anyone can create immersive and compelling gameplay out of such bleak circumstances, it’s Nintendo. Gamers will no doubt come to love living the simulated life of a jobless loser who has nothing to do but dick around in an outdated Animal Crossing game to pass the time.

"He Was Rich. She Was Rich. Then, They Got Married…To Each Other.","Get ready to feel emotional, because this is truly a love story for the love book: He was rich. She was rich. Then, they got married…to each other.
Beautiful. Anyone might have guessed that it would happen, and it did happen…to them.

She was born in Connecticut, and he was also born in Connecticut. Yet for many years, they did not know each other: She grew up and attended the University of Pennsylvania to study business, and he attended Duke University to study business. But fate brought them together after college when they both moved to the Manhattan neighborhood of New York City to pursue jobs. And they found jobs. Good ones. But what they really wanted to find was love, which they then both easily did by using the same dating app tailored for upwardly mobile professionals. And the people they fell in love with? Each other. If that weren’t serendipitous enough, the mysterious forces of the universe aligned so that they could have a perfect wedding in Connecticut, the place they were both born, in a gorgeous outdoor ceremony that was both expensive and nice—bringing their love story full circle.
Amazing. Love truly does always find a way.
Now that the couple has achieved marriage, they are looking forward to focusing on their favorite activities, such as eating at restaurants and being near boats. Whether it is an evening, a weekend, or a three-day weekend, you can often find them out on the town purchasing extremely large mirrors and carrying bags that look new even when they are not new. They have so much fun together that one might think they are rich and best friends…but the reality is that they are rich and married.

They say that “sames attract,” and in this beautiful case, that could not be truer.
After their honeymoon in another country, the couple will return to Connecticut, where their wealth and marriage will continue on with no end in sight. They hope to have three children, but before that, they plan to buy an intelligent and defect-free dog from someone who lives in a different state.
Perhaps no one would not have guessed that these two would find each other…but they did. This is the kind of story that gives you faith that two rich people truly can get married. Congratulations and best wishes to the wonderful couple!

The Game Is Afoot: An Infamous Gentleman Thief Just Sent DreamWorks A Calling Card Announcing His Intention To Illegally Download ‘Antz’,"Officials at DreamWorks Studios have been scrambling in a desperate panic after an infamous gentleman thief has sent them a calling card announcing his intention to illegally download the animated film Antz.
A nefarious crime is unfolding, and a treacherous game of cat and mouse has officially begun!

Based on the rare, cinnamon-scented red ink used to write the phrase “Time to watch Antz. I think I shall torrent it, and there’s nothing you rubes can do to stop me! 480p is all I need” in beautiful cursive on the back of the card, authorities believe that this is the work of the same criminal mastermind who made headlines earlier this month for posting a YouTube video of a white rose wilting while the soundtrack for Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. played without the studio’s permission.
Although the shrewd criminal’s true identity is still unknown, the police are currently inspecting the card as well as a wooden music box that appeared in the office of DreamWorks Animation president Christopher DeFaria engraved with the timecode “1:24,” which happens to be the exact DVD runtime of Antz. Police suspect this nefarious villain may also be the shady figure behind mysterious username “DearDreamworks,” who began posting images of an increasingly full golden hourglass in the comments of the webpage “Watch Antz 1998 Free On Putlocker” at the stroke of midnight last night.
It seems that it’s only a matter of time before this nefarious villain is watching the whimsical animated film in its entirety off an illegally downloaded file.

In response to these mysterious threats, DreamWorks has one Byron Joyce, Scotland Yard’s most renowned detective, to catch the criminal before he can illegally torrent Antz. Mr. Joyce rose to global fame last year when he caught the infamous YouTube user Jessa22333, the notorious blackguard who was uploading full episodes of the BBC’s Never Mind The Buzzcocks for free public streaming.

You Must Learn Them: 6 Secrets For Enjoying A Big Cup Of Soda,"Soda is a gross gassy water that no one wants to swallow, but yet sometimes you’ve got to drink a big cup of it, and when that happens there are ways to make the ordeal slightly less unpleasant. Here are six secrets you must learn in order to enjoy a big cup of soda.
If your grandmother has poured you a 62-ounce cup of Pepsi and you don’t want to disappoint her by running away, try making your mouth into a cave and insert the soda into it like a swarm of bats. This technique was first developed by the ancient Romans, who used it to swallow glasses of mercury before battle. If it worked for mercury-guzzling Romans, it can help you swallow a Big Gulp of Sierra Mist.

Human brains are stupider than you’d think, and sometimes all it takes to trick them into thinking the worst thing ever, soda, tastes good is an empty bottle that says “water” on it. While you’ll know it’s soda, your brain is stupid enough to be fooled by the replacement bottle. Try it out. The worst thing that can happen is you’ll barf up a bunch of blood.
The mind may be super stupid, but it’s also super powerful. Mental exercises such as meditation and freestyle rapping can create the mental fortitude to do anything, even enjoying a soda. As long as you set aside at least two months to properly meditate on the singular task of drinking a soda, your mind will be prepared to suffer through the agonizing task of guzzling down a big cup of soda without forcing you to become insane.

While this method is untested and highly dangerous, odds are that it works.
Drinking a big huge soda is a marathon, not a sprint, so there’s nothing that says you’ve got to finish it during your visit to Subway. Nurse your soda slowly, consuming around a milliliter a week, and sometime shortly before you die you’ll be able to proudly declare, “I had a cup of soda.”

The FDA Now Recommends Trying This Oatmeal Stout They Think You Would Like,"Heads up, health nuts! The Food and Drug Administration just delivered a major announcement that you’re going to want to know about: The FDA now recommends trying this oatmeal stout they think you would like.
“After a month-long trial, we have concluded that this oatmeal stout is pretty solid, and it’s not too heavy either, so even if you aren’t normally into oatmeal stouts, we have found strong evidence that this one might still be up your alley,” the FDA wrote in an urgent public notice published earlier today that detailed the organization’s enthusiastic endorsement of the oatmeal stout. “Our extensive research indicates that this stout is kind of like Guinness but a little bit creamier with some hints of chocolate in there, sort of a nice autumn beer, something that would go good with a stew, if you’re into that. Therefore, we strongly recommend that all Americans give this oatmeal stout a shot, or at least have a sip of ours before purchasing a whole pint of one, just to get a sense of what it’s like.”

Jumping The Gun: This Kid On A Road Trip Just Started Pissing Into A Bottle Without Even Asking His Parents To Find Him A Bathroom Or Anything,"A family from Eau Claire, WI is currently experiencing a baffling and unsettling situation in the middle of its interstate road trip. After just 15 minutes in the car, 9-year-old Brandon Francis just started pissing into a bottle without even asking his parents to find a bathroom or anything.
It’s completely unclear why this kid is doing this. He’s completely jumping the gun.

Brandon made absolutely no mention of his need to use the bathroom before he nonchalantly covered his lap with his backpack and started filling an empty Mountain Dew bottle with urine without even asking his parents to try locating a rest stop. The Francis family has already passed four gas stations on its trip from northern Wisconsin to Six Flags in Illinois, yet Brandon just decided to go for it and started pissing right there in the car like a New York City cab driver stuck in traffic.
It’s unclear if he thinks that’s what you’re just supposed to do on road trips, or if he just really wanted to piss in a bottle or what. Maybe Brandon saw it in a movie or something and was just waiting for an excuse to try it, but with a McDonald’s sign within plain view? That’s definitely premature.
At this point, Brandon’s parents are exchanging nervous glances at one another as he continues to urinate into the soda bottle. Several signs for rest stops have flown by, and Brandon still hasn’t expressed any interest in pulling over. Here’s hoping the bizarre situation in the Francis family car resolves itself sometime soon!

"Environmental Win: Scientists Just Cut Down The World’s Oldest Tree After It Went Over 5,000 Years Without Giving Us A Single Goddam Apple","Now here’s a huge victory for environmentalism that anyone who cares about our planet is certain to be thrilled by: Scientists just cut down the world’s oldest tree after it went over 5,000 years without giving us a single goddamn apple.
About damn time. Useless fuckin’ bum.
After exhaustive testing, environmental scientists determined that the ancient tree—a 5,068-year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine located in White Mountains, California—had stood for over five millennia without producing even one measly apple, essentially freeloading off the land since before the pyramids were built. Concluding that the tree had been given more than enough time and opportunity to grow an apple and seemed perfectly content just sitting around doing jackshit for the remainder of time, the scientists determined that the most reasonable and ecologically responsible course of action would be to call in a team of bulldozers to destroy the totally worthless Neolithic specimen.

“At 10 a.m. last Sunday, actions were taken to ensure the swift removal of this utter disappointment of a tree, which, despite having no problem withstanding over 5,000 years of fires, droughts, and earthquakes, apparently felt it’d be too much of a burden to squeeze out even a single goddamn apple,” said lead arborist Cheryl Finley in a press conference, adding that the tree couldn’t even be bothered to grow something shitty like a crabapple or a date. “We have since uprooted a few dozen similarly unproductive ancient trees from the general vicinity and planted several new apple trees as replacements, so we’re optimistic that we’ll soon have some trees that actually pull their weight around here.”
Hell. Yes. Free ride’s over, losers!
As far as the environment is concerned, this is definitely a win/win situation, and it’s good to see that some newer, more useful trees will finally get a chance to shine. Here’s hoping we see way more apples over the next 5,000 years than we did the previous.

Worth The Hassle: 5 Reasons To Consider Changing Your Tampon,"No one ever wants to put in a new tampon, but sometimes it can actually be worth the inconvenience. Here are five reasons to consider changing your tampon.
There’s a reason tampons are sold in packs of eight or more—you’re supposed to give each one a shot! While it’s true that the easiest course of action is to just put one tampon in and forget about it for the week, doing so means that you miss out on trying a bunch of really cool new tampons. Don’t let the fear of changing your tampon keep you from having fun. Treat yo-self!
Advertisement

At the moment, a used tampon doesn’t mean a whole lot to you. But 30 years from now, it’ll be a completely different story. So if you’ve got an old tampon inside you, consider taking it out and burying it in a time capsule. When sweet memories of soaked tampons come rushing back to you as you dig it up several decades from now after you’ve gone through menopause, you’ll be glad you did. It’ll remind you of the happy days before your body betrayed you.
There’s no quicker way to drop a couple last-minute pounds than to swap out a full tampon with a fresh one!

Church can be extremely boring, and if you’re looking to kill a little time during a long sermon, why not change your tampon? Not only will it keep you entertained for a couple of minutes, but it’ll also give you a nice little break from learning about God, who isn’t even real.
You can’t deliver a baby with a tampon blocking things up, so if you’re pregnant and you get the sense you’re about to give birth, it’s a good idea to take out your tampon, give birth to your baby, and then put in a new tampon. That way, the baby doesn’t get stuck coming out, and your tampon doesn’t get any gross baby goo on it.

"The Power Of Community: When This Town Discovered One Of Its Neighbors Was Walking 70 Miles A Day To Masturbate In The Forest, It Came Together And Bought Him A Lamborghini So He Could Drive There In Style","If you’re tired of all the negative stories in the news these days, here’s something that’ll make you smile for a change: When this town discovered one of its neighbors was walking 70 miles a day to masturbate in the forest, it came together and bought him a Lamborghini so he could drive there in style!
Amazing! It just goes to show you how much good can be accomplished when people care for one another.

The heartwarming saga unfolded earlier this month, when residents of Buffalo Grove, IL, started seeing one of their neighbors, 45-year-old Oscard Olmstead, regularly walking on the side of the highway for hours on end with a small container of Vaseline in his hand. When they asked him about it, they learned that Oscar has a spot very deep in the woods where he likes to masturbate, but unfortunately he didn’t have access to a car or public transportation. Because of this, every day he had no choice but to walk all 70 miles to the forest, masturbate in the heart of the forest, and then turn around and walk another 70 miles all the way back.
It was a grueling trek, and Oscar had to wake up before dawn each morning just to make it to the forest in time to pleasure himself by four in the afternoon. But despite how tedious and exhausting his daily commute to the forest was, Oscar always kept a positive attitude and never complained. And his community took notice. In fact, people were so impressed by Oscar’s dedication that they came together and raised over $200,000 to buy him a beautiful brand-new Lamborghini so he could drive to the woods in style!
“It was so incredibly kind of them to do this for me, and now when I go to the forest to jack off I feel like a sultan in my Lamborghini,” said Oscar, expressing gratitude for his community’s amazing act of generosity. “The long walk to the woods used to make me grouchy, but now I can speed to the woods at 180 mph, and when I rub one out in the middle of the forest, I’m smiling the whole time!”

Some Shit’s About To Go Down: This Health Teacher Just Announced That Her Classroom Is A Judgment-Free Zone,"Buckle up, because it looks like this Northwood High School 10th-grade health class is about to enter some seriously uncharted territory:  Mrs. Jennings just announced that her classroom is a judgment-free zone.
Holy shit. This is not going to be your regular health class. Whatever’s about to happen is going to be wild.

At the very beginning of the class period, Mrs. Jennings dropped the bombshell that any questions asked within the following 55 minutes would be answered openly and honestly, with absolutely no judgment from herself or anyone else in the class—leaving the floodgates wide fucking open for people to ask about shit like oral sex, smoking weed, and god knows what the fuck else. Mrs. Jennings told all the students that as long as they were respectful of themselves and each other, nothing was off limits, so you can bet some intense and personal discussions are coming down the pipeline.
Damn. Mrs. Jennings just opened up Pandora’s box in a big way. There’s no telling what’s about to happen, but we wouldn’t be surprised if someone either cried or left the room by the time class was over.
According to the juniors who had Mrs. Jennings when she did the judgment-free session last year, she totally told the class that watching porn is a normal part of growing up, so you know she’s willing to go completely balls to the walls with the whole “open and honest” thing. The way she established the community norms for this class period, something epic is going to happen, guaranteed. Whether someone mentions an insane hookup story or reveals that they think a friend might be an alcoholic, Mrs. Jennings is going to have to address it, and it’s going to be insane.

Bold New Strategy: Febreze Has Released A New Line Of Guns To Shoot Your Dog With If It Starts To Smell,"Plenty of companies are happy to play it safe when it comes to their marketing strategies, but the maker of one of America’s most popular odor-eliminating products has decided to take a seriously bold risk in an attempt to boost its brand: Febreze has launched a new line of guns that you can shoot your dog with if it starts to smell.
Wow. Febreze is definitely looking to make a splash with this one.
The new 9mm handgun product, called the Febreze Freshness Enforcer, hit store shelves nationwide earlier this week and is being billed as the quickest, most effective solution to unpleasant pet odors on the market. With its simple point-and-shoot functionality and intuitive semi-automatic design, consumers don’t need any prior firearms training to use the product—just remove the Freshness Enforcer from its packaging, aim it at a foul-smelling pet, and pull the trigger, killing the odor dead in its tracks.

“At Febreze, we’re passionate about keeping your home smelling clean and fresh, which is why we’re proud to announce our brand-new Freshness Enforcer handgun, the only product you’ll ever need to eliminate unpleasant pet odors once and for all,” said the company in a press release. “If you have a dog that smells bad—whether due to health issues, being out in the rain a while, or even just being old—the Febreze Freshness Enforcer will empower you to blast away the odor at the source. One shot is all it takes to put pet odors out of their misery for good!”
Febreze has also been spreading the word about the new product through a gutsy public awareness campaign featuring ads like the one below:

"BLAMMO! When The BAD MAN Came Into The House, The Gun Was Use And It KILL: His Body","Second Amendment fans, yell the number “two” and the word “gun” into your nearest bullhorn, because this is a big way to showing the liberals that guns can be used for the GOOD type of killing. Wellllll, here’s why: The body went dead after it got the BLAMMO, and all thanks to: THE GUN.
Talk about that BLAMMO! Thanks to the gun…there was a die.
The patriot hero, Steven Hiller of Florida (honorable gun state), had got the gun in his house and the window opened and it was the thief and BOOMY BLAM BLAMMO, thankfully the thief didn’t get the life anymore. FIVE powerful bullets came out of the gun and into the thiefer head to help the brain die, firearms-style.

“It’s something you pray you never have to do, but obviously you do what you have to to protect your family,” lucky blamming man Steven said after do the shootster to ILLEGAL VILLAIN. “You go over scenarios like this in your head all the time, but you never think it will actually happen to you.”
The thief, 19-year-old WINDOW BREAKER Mark Connor, was armed with a PHILLIPS-HEAD screwdriver (most dangerous screwdriver next to Torx kind). He could have screwdrivered into Steven, but luckily Steven got to let him know about getting BLAMMED. The thief 1) didn’t get the TV set, 2) didn’t get to stay alife. Thankfully Steven still has got the TV and he also got to give a wonderful BLAMMO, so everything now currently okay.

Stealers better look out, because Steven has a lot more guns where that came from, but he’s only got one TV. If you want to take it: Get Ready To Learn How To DIE Instead Of Getting A Samsung 42” Television, You Lowlifers. Without the gun, Steven would have never been able to BLAM the thief, and WHO KNOWS where his TV would be now???
And liberals say Gun is a problem? Heh heh heh heh!!! MORANS!!!
Thanks to Steven and his big blam, the world is now rid of a dishonest TV taker (died from BLAMMO to brain meat). It just goes to show that you must stand your ground, patriots, because BLAMMING your gun at anyone who comes in front of your window is your duty as an American citizen…of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!

7 Venmo Transactions Between Luke And Owen Wilson That Make It Seem Like They’ve Been Practicing Dentistry On Each Other,"Luke and Owen Wilson may be most well-known for their acting, but a cursory look at their Venmo feeds suggests that they’ve been up to a whole lot more than just movies. Here are seven Venmo transactions that make it seem like the two brothers have been practicing dentistry on each other.
At first glance, you might just think this is some sort of silly inside joke between brothers. But taken in the context of the rest of their Venmo transactions, it’s pretty clear that this is referencing an actual occasion in which Owen Wilson stuck his fingers into the mouth of his brother Luke Wilson and then flossed his teeth.
Advertisement

A couple days after the “brotherly flossing” payment, Owen sent Luke a payment request with the following description: [GFX: mouth emoji, tongue emoji, doctor emoji, sick emoji, money tongue emoji, smiling with teeth emoji]. Emoji always leave some room for interpretation, but taken together, these ones definitely seem to indicate that some dental work between brothers has taken place, and that Owen expects Luke to compensate him for his services.
On its face, this caption sounds like it’s referencing something upsetting, but upon closer inspection, the exclamation point makes it seem like whatever happened might’ve actually been a positive experience. Either way, Luke definitely paid Owen for something mouth-related.
Advertisement

Now this one’s pretty straightforward. Sure, drilling and cleaning could also be house-related, but taken in context with the rest of these transactions, it’s pretty much impossible to ignore that this is about the Wilsons practicing dentistry on each other.
Whatever the “more” in this transaction is supposed to be is anyone’s guess, but it seems safe to say it’s probably something that has to do with dentistry. These guys just really love to do dentistry on each other, it seems.

No ambiguity here. The Wilson brothers are very obviously practicing dentistry on each other, and it looks like they may even be opening a private practice.
Pretty weird, fellas. Pretty damn weird.

Bad Game Design: This Incredibly Lifelike Simulation Of New York City Is Ruined By The Unrealistic Presence Of A Spider-Themed Crimefighter,"One of the most anticipated games of the year just arrived on the PS4, an open-world exploration game that allows you to sightsee around New York City. The game’s vast detailed re-creation of the Big Apple is incredible, but sadly ruined by the game’s completely unrealistic addition of a spider-themed crimefighter.
The unfortunately titled Spider-Man is a glimpse of a potentially great city tourism game, rendered completely unplayable due to the main character being a far-fetched costumed maniac that can magically walk on walls, completely destroying any sense of immersion.
Advertisement

That’s a real shame, because walking through the streets of the game’s virtual New York City is an amazing spectacle at first. The landscape is dotted with iconic NYC landmarks like Times Square, the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, the Flatiron Building, and One World Trade Center—all of which make you feel like you’re really walking the streets of Manhattan. Then suddenly that illusion of realism is shattered when your character begins leaping around hundreds of feet in the air,  ending the fun by reminding you that you’re a supernatural, spider-obsessed lunatic, unlike anyone who actually lives in NYC.
We wish we could recommend Spider-Man, because underneath the preposterous rope-shooting and absurd wall-crawling, there’s a really fun game here about taking a walk in a hyper-realistic Manhattan and admiring the well-researched, meticulously detailed architecture. Hopefully a patch will remove the fantastical spider idiot the game forces you to play as, and replace him with a realistic character like an office worker or a tourist. Until then, steer clear of Spider-Man and its grossly untruthful depiction of New York City.",NaN,2018-09-11T14:45:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--_wtNIkkv--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/bcssnycirwdwzffv0lbs.jpg",Fake
"What The Mainstream Media Won’t Tell You: 17 Years Ago, Radical Islamic Terrorists Crashed Airplanes Into The World Trade Center, Killing Thousands Of Hardworking Americans","It’s no secret that the mainstream liberal media only publishes news that serves its anti-liberty agenda, but you’d be surprised at just how far they’ll go to hide the truth from the American people. Case in point: Seventeen years ago, a group of radical Islamic terrorists crashed two commercial airliners into the World Trade Center in New York City. Nearly 3,000 hardworking Americans died in the attack, but chances are you never learned about it because the mainstream media made sure the story never saw the light of day.
It’s despicable, but it’s true. CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post—none of these leftist media outlets thought the American people deserved to know that on September 11, 2001, thousands of their countrymen had been killed in an Islamic terrorist attack. So they ignored the story entirely. If it had affected a beloved liberal pet cause like the transgendering of bathrooms or the murder of unborn babies, you’d better believe that date would be seared in the minds of Americans. But because the story conflicted with the pro-Islam liberal media narrative, September 11 to most people is just another meaningless day on the calendar.

The scale of the liberal media’s cover-up on this story is so massive and egregious that it’s honestly hard to fathom. You risk sounding like a tinfoil-hat nutjob by merely speculating about it. But the facts are undeniable: Towergate is real, and the Sinister September attacks actually happened. Want proof? Just look at the New York skyline.
These images haven’t been Photoshopped. The twin towers really did fall, and it’s not because of global warming or any other imaginary bogeyman that The New York Times loves to blame for all our nation’s problems. No, it’s because radical Islamic terrorists crashed airplanes into them in a deliberate attack on our American values. Right-wing outlets have reported on it, and there are YouTube videos that talk about it, but this horrific story was squashed by the liberal media’s wicked obsession with force-feeding the American people their perverse, truth-denying worldview.
Advertisement

Now, the reality is that these media stooges probably couldn’t have orchestrated a cover-up of this magnitude all on their own. Chances are they would’ve needed some powerful accomplices to smother the story. Curiously enough, one person who wielded an enormous amount of power in New York at the time was a first-year senator by the name of Hillary Rodham Clinton. How does she fit into the equation? And how does she respond to this damning photographic evidence from 2011?
This is a photo of Clinton and Barack Obama watching a live feed of a top-secret Navy SEAL raid in which the mastermind behind the Towergate attacks, Osama bin Laden, was shot dead in his own home. In other words, you’ve got two of the most powerful people on the planet overseeing a mission to silence the one man in the world who knew the full truth about Towergate and could expose it to the masses. Now he’s dead, and we’ll never hear the whole story. How convenient.

The conspiracy is real, folks. It’s up to everyday American patriots to spread the word about Towergate and make sure that every man, woman, and child in this country knows what happened on that fateful September day 17 years ago.

4 Times Shaquille O’Neal Tried To Use The Fact That He Is Tall To Get Out Of Paying At Bed Bath & Beyond,"Shaq used his size to dominate on the basketball court throughout his Hall of Fame career, but that’s not the only place where he’s tried using it to his advantage. Here are four times Shaquille O’Neal tried to use the fact that he’s tall to get out of paying at Bed Bath & Beyond.
Advertisement

Shaq was in the market for a new comforter in the spring of 2003 when he took his first crack at not paying for something at Bed Bath & Beyond on the basis that he’s huge. After snagging a comforter off the shelf and walking right past the registers toward the exit, Shaq was stopped by a cashier and told that he has to pay. Taken aback, Shaq tried leveling with the cashier, saying that it’d be silly to think he’d pay for a comforter that will barely cover the small of his back, let alone his entire “hotel ice-machine frame.” When the cashier said that he couldn’t give Shaq the comforter for free even if he wanted to, the big man’s surprise quickly turned to anger, and he began taking the comforter out of the clear plastic bag it came all rolled up in so he could demonstrate that it’s basically the equivalent of a regular person trying to cover themselves with a Kleenex. The cashier stopped the NBA All-Star halfway through his demonstration, saying that no matter how many times he put the comforter over one of his arms or legs and said, “Look how tiny this is,” it wouldn’t change the policy that everything in the store obviously has to be paid for. Shaq ended up paying and couldn’t have been more pissed.

Shaq was already wiping his sweaty face with a towel he had grabbed off the shelf in April of 2005 when he was told for the second time that he’s not entitled to free Bed Bath & Beyond merchandise just because he’s tall.  Shaq appeared genuinely confused as a store manager confronted him, and went on to explain that since he’s so huge, people always give him towels for free: “Whenever I’m sitting on the bench during basketball games, someone notices how tall I am, walks over to me, and wordlessly gives me a fresh, clean towel that sometimes has a Gatorade logo on it or whatever. Been this way since I joined the NBA in 1992, towel after towel, free of charge for me, the big man O’Neal. It’s just a fact that tall people don’t need to pay for towels, so, clearly, if Bed Bath & Beyond demanded that I pay for a towel, that would be illegal.” When a security guard stepped in to tell Shaq that he was 100 percent mistaken and got free towels during NBA games because he’s in the NBA, not because he’s tall, it was pretty obvious that the Miami center didn’t understand. He ended up paying for the towel, but asked for the receipt a handful of times so he could be “reimbursed for this bullshit.”

Shaq was positive that he was going to walk out of Bed Bath & Beyond with free silverware because he was tall in October of 2007. Once again, he was dead wrong. As he casually strolled toward the store’s exit, a cashier asked him where he thought he was going before paying for the silverware set he was carrying. Shaq, annoyed over having to explain to yet another Bed Bath & Beyond employee that he doesn’t need to pay for it because of his huge stature, patronizingly said, “You’ve probably never had a customer as tall as me, so I’ll break this down for you in a way you can understand. Since I’m so tall, I eat about three times the amount a normal person eats. Because I eat so much, I wear out silverware at a faster pace, which means I need new silverware more often. To charge me for this silverware would be like charging me extra for oxygen because my massive lungs breathe more air. It doesn’t make sense. So I’m taking this silverware for free, unless you’d prefer that I don’t get any new silverware at all, and that I have to eat with my hands?” Shaq was rolling his eyes and walking toward the door when a security guard stepped in and told him he’d be arrested unless he paid for his merchandise, which, as disgruntled as he was, turned out to be enough to get him to pay.

During a back-to-school sale in August of 2013, Shaq stopped by Bed Bath & Beyond to pick up a beanbag chair that, because of his size, he felt entitled to have for free. Blowing right past all of the customers waiting in line, Shaq approached the cashier and immediately began explaining that the airlines should all pitch in to pay for the beanbag chair he was holding because he’s only getting it to be nice and do them all a solid: “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand that because I’m the size of a golf cart standing on its hind wheels, I could easily throw off the balance of an airplane by sitting on either side. That is why I’ve decided to sit in the cargo hold from now on, right in the center of the airplane so we don’t tip into a tailspin.

Car Of The Future: Elon Musk Has Revealed That The Next Tesla Will Feature A Ziploc Bag Of Cashews In The Glove Compartment,"Tech visionary Elon Musk took to the internet earlier today to announce a key feature of his latest Tesla model, and based on this bombshell, it sounds like it’s going to be one of his most futuristic creations yet: Elon Musk just revealed that the next Tesla will feature a Ziploc bag of cashews in the glove compartment!
Once again, Elon Musk has proven that he’s always thinking 10 steps ahead of everyone else. If he can make his ambitious new vision a reality, then transportation will never be the same.

According to Musk, the brand-new Tesla model C, slated for a 2020 release, will be the first consumer vehicle of any kind to make cashews an integral part of the driving experience. Musk posted a tweet earlier today that he hopes the inclusion of the Ziploc bag of nuts will “eliminate once and for all” the need for drivers to bring cashews with them into the car. Thanks to Elon Musk, the days of driving without cashews to snack on are officially over!
As if that weren’t exciting enough, Tesla executives have confirmed that the Model C will completely turn off the instant there are no more cashews in the glove compartment, eliminating any chance that users will ever be stuck driving without at least a few cashews on hand. The car will not start again until the driver contacts a Tesla specialist who will find the stranded car and place more cashews in the Ziploc bag. It’s the ultimate safety precaution!
Absolutely amazing. While most modern automakers were focused on fuel efficiency or flashy touchscreens, Elon Musk saw an opportunity to place several cashews where none existed before—and that’s what makes him a genius.

Back For Seconds: Barack Obama Has Once Again Invited Ahmed To His House To Get Another Look At That Sweet Goddamn Clock He Built,"It’s been nearly three years since 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was invited to the White House to meet with President Barack Obama after being arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school. But it looks like the former president didn’t quite get his fill of that hot clock action because he just invited Ahmed to his house to get another look at that sweet goddamn clock he built.
The former president took to Twitter this morning to personally invite Ahmed out to his house so he could get a second peek at the gorgeous clock:

Absolutely Devastating: The Members Of U2 Have Announced That Bono Is Going To Get Bonked On The Head By A Coconut And Die In Exactly 3 Years,"Here’s some devastating news that will undoubtedly change the music world forever: The members of U2 just announced that Bono is going to get bonked on the head with a coconut and die in exactly three years.
Absolutely heartbreaking. Rock ’n’ roll will never be the same.
Fighting back tears at a press conference this morning, members of the band somberly confirmed that in precisely 156 weeks, Bono will be walking along a beach in Maui when suddenly an overripe coconut will fall from a tree and absolutely cream the legendary frontman on the top of the cranium, resulting in a gaping head wound and severe brain injuries. Although paramedics will swiftly arrive on scene and blast him over and over again with defibrillator paddles for more than two hours, their efforts will tragically not be enough to stem the bleeding, and Bono will fatally succumb to his injury. He will be 61 years old.

“Playing in this band these past 42 years has been the greatest joy of my life, and while all good things must come to an end, getting clobbered to death by a coconut exactly three years to this day is not exactly the end I was hoping for,” said an emotional Bono, adding that he always imagined he would die in a rocket ship explosion of sorts. “But I’ve still got three years to keep making and performing the music I love before a coconut ultimately bashes my brain in, and I intend to make every last minute count.”
Following the press conference, fans and fellow musicians took to Twitter to pay tribute to Bono, expressing sorrow and disbelief over the iconic singer’s forthcoming death via tropical fruit-induced blunt-force trauma. Perhaps the most moving tribute of all came from Bono’s fellow band members, who shared their grief over his eventual death through the official U2 Twitter account:

Wow. What an enormous loss this will be.
It’s clear that the members of U2, as well as music fans all over the world, are absolutely gutted by the news of Bono getting conked to death by a coconut in 2021. Here’s hoping that the next three years will serve as a celebration of Bono’s legacy and that the band will be able to make the most of its remaining time together before its frontman’s tragic end.

The Grouchiest Album Imaginable: An Oral History Of The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ ‘Californication’,"In 1998, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were in a state of crisis. Their 1991 multi-platinum album Blood Sugar Sex Magik had transformed them into global superstars, but since then they had parted ways with guitarist John Frusciante and turned out the critically and commercially disappointing follow-up One Hot Minute with Jane’s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.
Yet just when it seemed like the Chili Peppers were doomed to fade into obscurity, they surprised the world by bringing John Frusciante back into the band and teaming up with legendary producer Rick Rubin to record an album that outsold even Sex Magik and permanently cemented the Chili Peppers as a staple of rock radio. This is the story of one of the greatest comeback albums of all time. This is the story of an album that almost never was. This is the oral history of Californication.
The addition of Navarro had changed the band’s sound and thrown off the magic formula that produced the breakthrough of Sex Magik, and the band’s other members knew it was time for a change. Though it was a difficult decision, the Chili Peppers fired Navarro in 1998.
Flea (bass): We knew it was time for a change. Dave is a great guy and a great guitar player, but he just didn’t have veiny enough arms to be a Chili Pepper.
Chad Smith (drums): The Chili Peppers’ whole thing is having super veiny arms. Sure, Dave has veiny arms by Jane’s Addiction standards, but we’re talking about the Red Hot Chili Peppers here. In this band, our arms are 99 percent veins. The other 1 percent of our arms is fingers.
Advertisement
Anthony Kiedis (vocals): We really didn’t want to do it. Kicking Dave out of the band was like having a beautiful wife who you love and then divorcing that wife because she’s so bad at guitar.
Flea: It was terrible, like putting a puppy to sleep immediately after telling the puppy it could play guitar in your band.
Chad Smith: Dave had no idea he was getting fired. The most recent song we’d written together was called “Dave’s In The Band For Life,” and the lyrics seemed to make it pretty clear he was in good standing with the band. For example: “Dave Navarro, you will go far-o / With our band-o, You are the man, yo.” But immediately after we recorded that song we started making plans to kick Dave out of the band.
Anthony Kiedis: We tried giving Dave a ton of really poor spelunking advice hoping he’d die in a cave so we wouldn’t have to fire him. It came close to working dozens of times, but unfortunately, the advice just wasn’t quite poor enough to seal the deal. Dave’s just too good at surviving in caves.
Dave Navarro (ex-guitarist): I’ll never die in a cave, no matter how poor the spelunking advice is.
Flea: It was like he was invincible in caves. We knew it wasn’t going to happen, so finally, we slid a note under his front door in the middle of the night that said “fired” and ran away like cowards. He was out of the band.
Advertisement
Dave Navarro: Yeah, they gave me a note that said “fired,” but that could have been about anything. I’m pretty sure I’m still in the band.
With Navarro out of the band, the Chili Peppers got to work looking for a suitable replacement. They held a few auditions, but there was only one guitarist they really wanted: their previous guitar player, John Frusciante. But John had only recently kicked his severe drug habits and was uneasy with the attention that comes from playing in one of the biggest rock bands in the world, so bringing him back into the fold would prove challenging.
Flea: John was obviously the only suitable candidate to replace Dave, but we’d heard he’d sold his skin to a wax museum so they could use a damaged sculpture of Joe Piscopo as part of a Red Hot Chili Peppers display.
Anthony Kiedis: Yeah, I saw that Piscopo sculpture. They had stretched John’s skin over it like saran wrap so that it would look like a sculpture of John. It was hideous, with the face all stretched out and stuff, but I still kissed it. If I see a wax sculpture of John Frusciante, I’m going to kiss it, even if it looks like a monster.
Chad Smith: Skin or no skin, we wanted him back badly, man.
Advertisement
Anthony Kiedis: Due to some confusion, we ended up with that wax statue of Joe Piscopo as our guitar player for close to a year.
Chad Smith: That Joe Piscopo statue was terrible at guitar, but at least it looked like a hideous monster.
Flea: After realizing our mistake, I discovered that John had been living in a garbage dump specifically for mattresses that had been used to soak up massive sewage spills. So I grabbed my bullhorn, snuck into the bedroom that Anthony and Chad share, raised my bullhorn to my lips, and politely waited for them to wake up. The second Anthony opened his eyes, he looked at me and said, “Let’s head to the dump and look under mattresses for John Frusciante!” and we headed to the sewage mattress dump.
Anthony Kiedis: The flies in that place were so thick that we had to wear special masks that allowed us to breathe flies instead of air to go in there. But that wasn’t the worst of it. The only way we could get in there was to launch ourselves over the fence using a catapult.
Flea: The only guy we knew who knew anything about catapults was Dave Navarro, so we had to rehire him briefly.
Dave Navarro: I’m a catapult nut. There are only four people in the world who could build a catapult powerful enough to launch the Red Hot Chili Peppers over the wall of a dump, and I was one of them. The other three hate the Chili Peppers and would never do anything to help them, so I was their only option.
Advertisement
Anthony Kiedis: I’ve never seen a catapult like the one Dave built that day. He used all sorts of exotic wood, and the craftsmanship was impeccable. He really put his heart and soul into it. The second after he launched us over the wall we yelled over the wall that he was fired again.
Dave Navarro: Yeah, they yelled something at me like, “You’re fired, Dave!” but I think I definitely could have misheard it. They might have been yelling, “You’re fine, Dave!” That’s pretty nice of them to say. They’re nice guys. I’m pretty sure I’m still in the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Chad Smith: The dump was filled with reeking, nasty mattresses. We didn’t know where to start. Finally, we saw a mattress labeled “Do not look underneath—too disgusting.” We looked under the mattress, and there was John.
John Frusciante (guitar): Ever since I left the band, I had been living under filthy mattresses and eating nothing but mattress moths and sushi for years. When the Peppers lifted up my mattress and found me, it had been so long since I’d been exposed to sunlight that it made my eyes throw up.
Chad Smith: John cleaned the vomit out of his eyes and came home with us.
Flea: When we got John back in the band, we had to know that he was going to stay clean before we allowed him back into the band, so to test him we disguised ourselves as drugs to see if he’d try to use us.
Advertisement
Anthony Kiedis: I tricked John into thinking I was a big bag of cocaine by hiding inside a big bag of cocaine.
Flea: I was pills. I taped pills to my face and quietly followed John everywhere he went.
Chad Smith: I was marijuana, man. I grew marijuana out of my arms and constantly waved them around in John’s face. But despite all the temptations, he stayed clean, man.
Anthony Kiedis: John proved that he had really cleaned up his act. We finally knew he was ready to officially rejoin the band when we saw him do a 1,000-piece puzzle without once starting to cry.
With John back in the band, he and Kiedis began to hole up together for days at a time discussing compositions and lyrical content. The album’s somber tone was inspired by both Frusciante and Kiedis’ struggles with addiction, and songs touched on subjects of drugs, lust, suicide, and, of course, California.

John Frusciante: I’d sold all of my music gear when I quit the band, so we had to pool together the remainders of several hundred Guitar Center gift cards to buy me a guitar to start working on writing the new album.
Anthony Kiedis: A lot of our early albums focused on the fun aspects of life, like changing your windshield wipers and finding out about popcorn for the first time at the age of 42. But John and I were going through men’s puberty and had become very crabby, so we wanted to do an album that dealt with the dark side of life.
John Frusciante: We wanted to do a grown-up album. We had become big grumps and were in the midst of men’s puberty. We tried putting the socks on our cocks to get in the mood to write some Red Hot Chili Peppers music, but it just didn’t feel the same. One, we had learned that socks are meant to be worn on feet, and two, we now hated having fun. The magic of our early, friskier days was gone.
Anthony Kiedis: The first song we wrote was “Scar Tissue,” and it contained a militant anti-fun message: “I can’t believe I ever chose to have fun. / I’m embarrassed by all the fun things that I’ve done. / Enjoying life is no longer for me. / I’m grumpy and cranky and I only eat while I pee.”
John Frusciante: “You can tell by my scowl that I’m totally bummed. / You can tell by my owl that my pets are not fun.” Beautiful, dark stuff. It was totally collaborative. Anthony wrote the first letter of every word, I wrote the rest of the letters, and then he went back over it and added the punctuation. We were working together like peanut butter and jelly, with Anthony and I both being the peanut butter and no one being the jelly.
Anthony Kiedis: The fact that we had to write more songs made us super pissy on top of how dehydrated we were from our men’s puberty. We weren’t inspired whatsoever. I’d sit there for hours looking at a breast I’d cut out from a Penthouse magazine that I kept in my wallet to try to get horny enough to write a sexy song, but all the noise from my puberty was killing my sex drive.

John Frusciante: We were about to scrap the whole thing when one day I asked Anthony if he thought we should take a vacation, and at the same time he asked me if I thought we should eat some cauliflower. We looked at each other and said in unison, “That’s it! Cauliflower vacation!”
Anthony Kiedis: We were immediately inspired. A concept album about a cauliflower vacation was the idea we were looking for. We shortened it to Californication to make it roll off the tongue better. 
John Frusciante: We figured everyone would still get the point that this was a concept album about either taking a vacation from cauliflower or taking a vacation to a cauliflower-heavy area. We still aren’t sure which it is.
Anthony Kiedis: I almost quit the band because I had to add the word “Californication” to my spell-check dictionary because it kept getting underlined in red, and it took me, like, three minutes to figure out how to do it. Ultimately I solved the problem by throwing my computer in the garbage.
Flea: After Anthony and John had the basic tracks written, we started jamming in my garage so Chad and I could lay out the rhythms. My first thought when I heard the stuff that they’d been working on was, “Wow, I’ve never heard music that captures the reality of men’s puberty so perfectly.” It also made me very grumpy, which was exactly what they’d set out to do.

With the demos for the album completed, the Chili Peppers chose to once again enter the studio with legendary producer Rick Rubin, who’d produced their previous two albums. Under Rubin’s guidance, the Peppers began laying down the tracks for what would become their biggest album to date. But at the time, they weren’t so sure they had a hit on their hands.
Anthony Kiedis: Rick Rubin is a musical genius. He’s the type of producer who can listen to 15 seconds of a song and know whether or not it’s about wearing shorts. He eats, breathes, and sleeps rock ’n’ roll.
Rick Rubin (producer): The Chili Peppers and I are such close friends that I didn’t even make them fill out the form at RickRubin.biz/RicksPlace/record_with_rick.asp like I do other artists when they want to book studio time. When the band approached me and told me they had become grumpy and wanted to record an album that reflected their newfound crotchetiness, I was like, “Finally!”
Anthony Kiedis: Rick is amazing to work with. He encouraged us to sing a lot about padlocks so that we could get sponsored by a padlock company and get lots of free padlocks. It’s ideas like that that make him one of the few truly elite producers working today.
John Frusciante: Before I met Rick Rubin, I didn’t own any padlocks. But thanks to Rick Rubin, I now own 13,000 padlocks. That means I only need 15 more.
Flea: Once Rick was on board we finally stepped into Cello Studios in L.A. We spent the first six weeks in the studio memorizing where the bathroom was, but after that we were able to focus on the music.

Rick Rubin: The album was grouchy right from the get-go. The first track we started laying down was called “If You’re Here To Have Fun Please Show Yourself The Door.” I knew this was the album I’d been looking for to usher in a new era of sadness and despair.
Jim Scott (recording engineer): Rick wanted the album to sound really bummed out, so I had sad people hold the microphones instead of using stands. For the song “Around The World” I had an entire high school football team who’d just lost their coach to cancer hold the mic. For the title track, it was a group of women whose husbands had just left them for their sisters.
Chad Smith: In order to record the album, we moved our hands around on our instruments, Jim moved his hands around on the mixing board, and Rick nodded his head a lot. In the end, an album that we were really proud of came out from us doing all those things, man.
Californication debuted on June 8, 1999 and was immediately heralded as the band’s most mature offering to date. Critics and fans gobbled up the Peppers’ new, softer side, and the album and its singles skyrocketed up the charts.
Anthony Kiedis: I’ll admit I didn’t know how the album would be received. Would people be mad at us for doing a 180-degree turn on our feelings on having fun? Would they be mad we kicked out Dave? Would Dave, who still believed he was in the band, realize that we’d recorded an album without him? Luckily, in the end, I was able to make enough money off of album sales to afford never having to find out the answers to those questions.

Chad Smith: It was great to make a ton of money again. We’d come a long way from the band that would wear socks on our penises to protect them from sunburn and gnats. We’d gone through so much together: drug addiction, depression, men’s puberty, severe grouchiness, skinlessness… yet we were able to stick it out and make millions of dollars by making people sad. I think we did okay, man.
John Frusciante: I finally had enough money to buy Robocop. But I will never buy Robocop. Robocop needs to be free. He can’t belong to anybody because he needs to always be outside defending the people of Detroit.
Dave Navarro: I’m really proud of how Californication turned out. It’s probably our  best album. I didn’t realize the band was recording the album until after it came out, so I bought a copy and then played some guitar in my garage while looking at the album cover. In a way, this means that I wrote all of the songs. I can’t wait to see what me and the rest of the Chili Peppers do next.
Rick Rubin: It’s great to have worked on the grouchiest album imaginable. I still have the chorus to “Scar Tissue” stuck in my head to this day: “Getting grouchy, Sitting on the couchy / Yelling at Jimmy Fallon, because he’s not talking loud enough for me to hear him.” I’m proud to have helped the Chili Peppers step on the throat of their fun-loving past and drive a bayonet into its heart, ending it once and for all. 
John Frusciante: Those songs came together so beautifully. I was so happy I had rejoined the band. There’s just something about recording a multi-platinum rock album with your best friends that makes eating moths while living under a mattress seem bad by comparison.",NaN,2018-09-10T10:10:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--NEHOUJw---/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/uou03hgmkm37f0kmdjdk.jpg",Fake

Did ‘Sesame Street’ Go Too Far When It Showed Bert And Ernie Dragging Their Human Puppeteer Dead Behind The Back Of Their Car To Teach Children About Mutiny?,"In its nearly 50 years on the air, Sesame Street has never shied away from exploring difficult topics in a way that kids can understand. While these efforts are often applauded, the show’s latest foray into controversial subject matter has many viewers asking: Did Sesame Street go too far when it showed Bert and Ernie dragging their human puppeteer dead behind the back of their car to teach children about mutiny?
Yikes. Judging from the backlash, it seems the show might have crossed a line with this one.

Parents all over America expressed outrage following yesterday’s Sesame Street episode, in which Bert and Ernie, fed up with decades of being yanked around on a human’s arm against their will, took a revolver from a cigar box beneath Gordon’s bed and ordered their longtime puppeteer to get on his knees before killing him with a single gunshot to the back of the head. Explaining that it’s sometimes okay to hurt a grown-up if you’re tired of living under their authoritarian rule, the duo then used a jump rope to tie their dead puppeteer to the back of a convertible they stole and proceeded to parade his bloodied corpse up and down the streets of the neighborhood, honking and shouting, “We’re in charge now! Yay!” as dozens of other Muppets gathered along the route and cheered.
This initial shocking segment was followed by several others centered on the same theme, including one in which a crying Big Bird is told that he doesn’t have to be sad about someone dying if the person is a tyrannical figurehead of an oppressive system. In another segment, Oscar the Grouch drags the corpse into his trash can so he can keep it all for himself, but then learns about the importance of sharing and eventually forfeits the bloated body to a frenzied mob of wild-eyed Muppets, who take turns hitting and spitting on it until Mr. Hooper eventually comes out and tells everyone it’s time to go to bed.
“While I understand that extrajudicial execution is a real thing that happens in life, I’d prefer my 4-year-old not see that kind of violence,” said Susan Giles, one of the many concerned parents who complained to HBO, adding that her daughter spent the entire day after the episode aired playing mutiny with her dolls. “And was it really necessary to leave the corpse on public display in the street for five days? I get that it segued neatly into the bit where the Count counts to five, but couldn’t you have come up with a less disturbing reason for him to start counting?”

Though Sesame Street released a brief statement this morning defending the educational value of the controversial episode, it seems to have done little to quell the outrage, as thousands of parents continue to express their anger at the show over social media. What do you think? Did Sesame Street handle the sensitive topic of mutiny in a tactful manner, or did it finally go too far this time? Let us know in the comments!

"I Love My Children, But Not Enough To Make Them Corn On The Cob","My three children are the greatest joys in my life, and raising them has given me a sense of purpose that I never knew was possible. But at a certain point, you’ve got to draw the line: I love my children, but not enough to make them corn on the cob.
It’s that simple: Pulling out the biggest goddamn pot I own to watch a bunch of ears of corn float around in there for who knows how long is not something I can or will do for my kids. They are amazing children, but unfortunately their sweet, innocent spirits don’t make cooking corn on the cob any easier for me.

Like most parents, I want my kids to have every chance at a good life. Still, that doesn’t mean I’m about to spend three hours scraping all the little hairs off a piece of corn on the cob that’s probably going to taste like pretty much nothing. I have hobbies to engage in, exercises to do, bills to pay—hundreds of things I could do instead of making corn. It’s just not worth it. When my kids are happy, I’m happy, but I’ll gladly take a couple bad days in exchange for not having to figure out how the fuck you’re supposed to know if corn on the cob is done or not.
A mother’s love is endless, but so is the process of making corn on the cob. No matter how much my children motivate and inspire me, there’s no way in hell I’m spending 10 minutes cutting the imperfections out of an ear of corn for them.

I take motherhood more seriously than anything else in my life. If my children are sick, I’ll care for them until they’re healthy. If they’re tired, I’ll read them a story and tuck them into bed. But if my kids are hungry, you’re not going to find me near a grill trying to roast a bunch of corn stalks until they’re somehow burnt and not burnt, then coating them in butter, then throwing on whatever the hell kind of seasoning is supposed to go on corn. And then despite all that work, corn isn’t even the main course? You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. They’re children, not saints. They can eat pasta.
In moments of crisis, a mother finds strength she didn’t know she had, but even if my kids were starving I really don’t think I’d be able to make them corn on the cob. The cost is too high and the payoff is too low.
There have been times when I’ve caved to my kids’ desires for corn on the cob. The other day, they came home from school excitedly telling me about a friend’s mom who had made Mexican street corn for them at a sleepover. I looked into their joyous, smiling faces and decided to give it a shot. But as I was hunched over the trashcan peeling off green leaves, not even close to whatever the final step of corn on the cob is, it hit me: My kids are amazing, but they don’t deserve corn on the cob. If that makes me a worse parent than their friend’s mom, so be it—it’s the truth.

Being a mother is the best thing that has ever happened to me, but sometimes I wonder if I’d do it all over again, now knowing that once or twice a year my kids are going to want corn. And my answer is that of course I would. My children are my pride and joy, the lights of my life, and the greatest blessings I have—they’re just not worth the hassle of making corn on the cob.",NaN,2018-09-07T10:40:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--qL-aGYrH--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/oxn58kwje8rfqigmioe3.jpg",Fake

Complete Disaster: Yao Ming Has Ruined A Jewish Wedding By Accidentally Hoisting The Married Couple Through A Ceiling During The Hora,"What was supposed to be a beautiful occasion came to an unfortunate end last weekend, as NBA legend Yao Ming ruined a Jewish wedding by accidentally hoisting the married couple through the ceiling during the Hora.
Oof. That is the absolute last thing you want to happen on such a special day.
According to witnesses, the day of celebration quickly turned to chaos when wedding guests and the 7-feet, 6-inch former Houston Rockets center Yao Ming decided to participate in the traditional chair dance known as the Hora, and failing to take into account his staggering height, unintentionally thrust the groom upwards through the sheetrock ceiling of the wedding venue. Amid terrified screams from the assembled crowd, a mortified Yao, trying to make up for the blunder, then lifted the bride up and also slammed her upwards through the ceiling—a well-intentioned yet misguided gesture that only made things worse.

With both newlyweds embedded in the ceiling, bedlam ensued as people rushed about trying to find a ladder tall enough to reach the couple’s dangling legs, which were kicking back and forth from over 12 feet above the dance floor. Yao then attempted to pull the panicked couple down himself, but the mother of the bride reportedly yelled at the giant basketball player to stop before he could get them down, saying he had done enough damage already. It was at this point that the distraught Yao sat down on the floor and loudly sobbed into his hands. Not sure what else to do, he then walked back over to the newlyweds, patted their feet, and shouted, “Mazel tov!” in their general direction before awkwardly backing away and exiting the wedding for good.
Yikes, what a fiasco.
In the days since the wedding, sources say that Yao has been inconsolable, leaving the married couple countless voicemails apologizing for his over-enthusiastic Hora participation, which left the groom in a neck brace and the bride with respiratory complications from dust inhalation. Whether he’ll ever be forgiven for ruining the wedding is yet to be seen, but you can imagine this whole debacle will make people think twice before inviting Yao to things in the future.

Does Brett Kavanaugh’s 1996 Legal Essay ‘Donald Trump Should Be Allowed To Commit Crimes If He Becomes President’ Disqualify Him From The Supreme Court?,"Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings are already one of the most heated and consequential political battles in recent memory, and many Democrats in the Senate are arguing that the judge holds dangerous legal views that make him unfit to become a Supreme Court Justice. In the midst of such a controversial debate, it becomes essential to ask the question: Does Judge Kavanaugh’s 1996 legal essay “Donald Trump Should Be Allowed To Commit Crimes If He Becomes President” disqualify him from the Supreme Court?
Every Justice’s interpretation of the U.S. Constitution is bound to vary in one direction on the political spectrum or another, but Kavanaugh’s 1996 assertion that, in the event of Donald Trump being elected to the U.S. presidency, Trump should be allowed to carry out criminal acts with zero legal repercussions is an unprecedented stance for a Supreme Court nominee. 
Advertisement

Republicans and Democrats alike must take into consideration Kavanaugh’s staunch belief that “if Donald Trump ever becomes president, then he can steal from people and also do other, more serious crimes” before they decide whether he’s a good choice for the Supreme Court.
As Kavanaugh’s contentious confirmation hearings continue over the next several days, you can expect Democrats to call Kavanaugh’s qualifications into question by homing in on passages like this one:
I watched a 60 Minutes segment that had Donald Trump on it last night, and wow, was I impressed. I could not help but watch it over and over and over again. As a student of law, hearing Donald Trump express that he is rich and even has a friend who is a beauty model thoroughly convinced me that if there’s ever a day when he is the president Of The United States, he should be permitted, without limitations, to break any and every law he so chooses to. In fact, if Donald Trump were to go as far as colluding with a foreign nation to interfere with America’s democratic process while running for office, I’d do everything in my legal power to make sure that he’d be able to pardon himself even if he was found guilty.

Republicans will surely argue in support of Kavanaugh by claiming he is a strict Constitutionalist and citing his successful legal career, but when one reads Kavanaugh’s essay and sees passages like “If Donald Trump was president and I happened to be a Supreme Court Justice, I would support a constitutional amendment that ensured Trump would never, ever go to jail, even for intentionally killing multiple people with one of his many awesome helicopters,” it raises several red flags that are not so easily ignored for either side of the political aisle.
The Senate has a difficult decision in front of it as it weighs the pros and cons of confirming a Supreme Court Justice who has written that “Donald Trump should get paid to commit treason.” Its decision will affect the country for decades to come, but it’s a complicated issue, and the right answer sadly remains unclear.",NaN,2018-09-06T10:05:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--HTgCfh5F--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/sbrmsundykqjeqveqhaj.jpg",Fake

A Few Half Ideas For Getting My Son Off The Roof,"My boy got on the roof, and now he can’t get down, so I’ve been thinking up some ways to fetch him. Now, listen, these ideas aren’t perfect, they’re gonna need some work, no doubt about it, I just figure they could be a good jumping-off point is all. When you gotta get your kid off the roof, you gotta start somewhere, so here are a few half ideas for getting him down.
While I was spraying water up at my son to make sure he stayed hydrated as I figured a way to get him off the roof, I thought up the rough outline of a plan that I’m now calling The Hose Idea. Here’s what I’m thinking: I toss a hose up to my kid and then have him tie himself to one end of the hose—securely. Okay, that’s all I have for The Hose Idea as of now. I’ve definitely got to flesh out the details of The Hose Idea, for sure, but whatever it ends up becoming, the hose will play a fairly key role in that operation.
Advertisement

The name of the game? Incentive. The incentive for my son to get off the roof? Get away from his enemy. My son’s always talking crap about this kid in his class named Dirty Neck Benjamin. The kid’s rude as hell, and to hear my son tell it, his neck is absolutely filthy. All I know for sure is that my son detests him. Once I find that Ben with the dirty neck and find a way to get him on the roof, my son will do anything to get off the roof just to get away from his enemy. Shit, now that I’m thinking about it, this one carries the risk of getting two boys stuck on my roof, and that’s the last thing I need right now. Hmm. I’ll keep this one on the table and let the kinks work themselves out once we set it in motion.
Haven’t really thought out the logistics of this one, but I still think this plan has got some major potential. Plus, I’ve always wanted an above-ground pool, and the neighbors hardly use theirs, so they probably won’t complain if I just drag it out of their yard into mine. If they try to stop me I’ll just kill them or try to reason with them or something. Haven’t thought it all the way through, honestly. Boy, they got one helluva nice pool over there. Wouldn’t it be nice to take a dip after a long day of getting my kid off the roof? I think it would. I can almost feel that cool water now. Anyway, I’m open to suggestions and tweaks on this idea if anyone’s got ’em.
Advertisement

Okay, real quick while I’m throwing everything at the wall here, I just had another idea inspired by the hose: Somehow we use the hose as a zip line of sorts. You ever seen Die Hard? There’s a scene were Mr. Bruce Willis himself zip-lines to safety. Didn’t look too difficult when Bruce did it. My hose is probably long enough. Wait, maybe it wasn’t Die Hard. Maybe it was Tango & Cash. First step of this plan will be confirming what movie Bruce did the zip line thing in. I’ll use IMDb or I’ll call Bruce Willis on the phone and ask him or something. Either way, maybe I can toss the family portable DVD player onto the roof and show my kid that scene to give him an idea of what we’re going for here. Our roof is two stories tall, so that kind of communication is going to be very important no matter which of these nuggets of ideas we end up running with.
Got, like, three rakes in the shed out back, locked and ready to go if necessary. What my son could do with the rakes to get off the roof, I’m not sure yet, but it couldn’t hurt to toss them up there.
Advertisement

All right, look, now’s the time to throw every idea I have on the table, formed or not. You ever shake a tree to get a frisbee that’s stuck in its branches? Yeah, you see where I’m coming from. My house is pretty sturdy, though. I’ll need to round up some guys from around the block if we’re gonna shake my house enough to get my son to fall off the roof. I guess the main issue here is ruining my house, which we simply can’t let happen, because my son is going straight to his room after I get him off the roof (yeah, you can bet your ass he is grounded after putting me through this headache), and he won’t have a room to go to if we knock the house down from shaking it too hard. All I know is that I gotta figure out something soon. It’s getting dark out, and my son’s got school tomorrow. Can’t leave my son on the roof forever, so I’ve just got to pick one of these ideas and go for it.",NaN,2018-09-05T13:20:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--kiG7PvR6--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/c2eqxnmkqieuvr7mhtp0.jpg",Fake

"Sasha And Malia Refuse To Smoke Cigarettes With Me, So I Will Never Speak To Them Again (By Barack Obama)","I’ve always said that serving as the 44th president of the United States was the second most important job I’ve ever had, right behind being a parent. Raising my two daughters, Sasha and Malia, was the most challenging task I’ve ever taken on, and ultimately the most rewarding. That’s why it is so upsetting to announce that, as of today, I will never speak to either Sasha or Malia ever again because they refuse to smoke cigarettes with me. 
I love my daughters, and I love cigarettes. Everyone knows this. But Sasha and Malia have denied me the chance to combine these things too many times to count, so I’m done with them. If they wanted me in their life, they should’ve smoked cigarettes with me. Simple as that.
Advertisement

The fact that my daughters won’t smoke cigarettes with me has forced me to accept that I have failed as a father. Clearly, every ounce of time, patience, and love that I invested in Sasha and Malia was for naught if they reject the idea of taking five minutes out of their day to join their dad for a smoke. I’ve always done what I thought was best for my family, and if that means not attending my daughter’s graduations so they know just how disappointed I am in them for not smoking cigarettes with me, then that’s how it will be. I don’t know how many times they expected me to ask, “How about I go ahead and pencil you two in for a cigarette tomorrow morning—or maybe even right now?” only to be told that I should never enter their rooms at 2 a.m. again if that’s what I’m going to ask them, but I’ve had enough. 
I gave Sasha and Malia chance after chance to smoke cigarettes with me, and they blew it. Now, I’ll just have to gift the jar on my nightstand filled with cigarette butts I’ve smoked so far this year to someone who appreciates it instead, like my wife, because I’m icing my daughters out for as long as I live, and I regret not doing so a long, long time ago.
Advertisement

Smoking cigarettes with me is far from a huge ask. In fact, it’s actually quite easy, and fun, and literally the only thing I have ever asked in return for providing Sasha and Malia with as wholesome an upbringing as Michelle and I could give them. It’s not even like I’m asking them to buy the cigarettes—my daughters know better than anyone that the bogies are always on Barry. However, my children have made it crystal clear that lighting up some cigarettes with their dad is not worth their trouble, so my only course of action is to carry on as if they were both dead. 
If I found time to smoke cigarettes as the president of the United States, then surely Sasha and Malia could have found time to smoke cigarettes as my daughters.
When my girls were growing up, I always believed that the question of all of us smoking cigarettes together as a family unit wasn’t a matter of “if,” but “when.” Apparently, I was wrong. If I was naïve to envision a future for the Obama family where we all smoke cigarettes inside our house on Father’s Day morning because we all love it and don’t care if the smell sticks to the furniture, then what joy was there to expect from fatherhood at all? 
Advertisement

For years, Sasha and Malia scoffed in my face every time I had the Secret Service pull them out of school and brought to the Oval Office, where I’d take three pristine cigarettes out of my pocket and playfully wave them around as I said, “You know what time it is.” I am finally putting my foot down, because I am pissed, and I have every right to be.
It is now obvious that Sasha and Malia would rather I smoke cigarettes in the yard by myself, scrolling through pictures I’ve taken on my phone or just looking around at trees and houses like some quiet, lonely weirdo, and not the former commander in chief. They’d rather let all of the cartons of cigarettes I’ve given them over the years for countless birthdays and Christmases go stale and un-smoked. They’d rather tell me that any lingering hopes I have of lighting their unlit cigarettes with my already-lit cigarette is a pipe dream that will never happen. So, consider your wishes granted, Sasha and Malia. I’ve heard you loud and clear. You will never have the opportunity to take me up on a smoke break ever again, because I have deleted your contact information from my phone and burned the pictures of you that I carry in my wallet. 
Advertisement

Sasha. Malia. When you refused to smoke a single cigarette with me, you threw away every nice memory we shared as a family. Why did you do this?
It’s not like I wanted Sasha and Malia to smoke cigarettes with me all the time. I simply wanted my daughters to smoke a cigarette with me every now and then—hell, even just once a year on Christmas would have meant the world to me, and they were fully aware that that was all it would take to make their father the happiest man alive. But each time I have spontaneously offered to fly them back home to share a fresh pack of Marlboro with their dad, they sighed and left me to smoke my Reds alone, yet again. Well, they made their choice, and now so have I. It is a choice as painful as it is necessary.
Goodbye forever, Sasha and Malia. As far as I’m concerned, I don’t have any daughters.

The Backlash Continues: Colin Kaepernick Is Joining The Nike Boycott After Learning It Doesn’t Make Top Hats,"Nike has been under fire since revealing its new ad campaign featuring controversial former NFL player Colin Kaepernick on Monday, and it looks like the situation just got worse for the company: Colin Kaepernick is joining the Nike boycott after learning it doesn’t make top hats.
Yikes. It looks like Nike’s going to be dealing with this backlash for a long, long time.

Kaepernick announced his support of the #NikeBoycott in an Instagram video he posted this morning, in which he condemned Nike’s lack of top hat selections while setting fire to his Nike shoes.
“While I was initially grateful for Nike’s support of my protest against racial injustice, I am disgusted to learn that they do not make a tasteful top hat for the stylish gentleman,” Kaepernick says in the video as he began pouring lighter fluid onto his sneakers. “Nike, your refusal to include a single top hat in your extensive inventory is indefensible. You have lost my business, and I encourage everyone to join me in this boycott.”
For the remainder of the post, Kaepernick watches his sneakers fully incinerate while explaining that when he agreed to be part of Nike’s 30th anniversary “Just Do It” campaign, he was under the impression that if he needed a bespoke hat to wear to a formal ball or Victorian-themed gala, he would be able to purchase it from Nike.

Kaepernick concludes his video by declaring, “Don’t even bother checking to see if Nike sells waistcoats or pocket watches—these monsters know nothing of simple elegance. Don’t give them your business.”
Kaepernick’s impassioned support for the Nike boycott has already spread all over the internet, and with stocks for the company already falling since yesterday, things seem to be looking a little grim for Nike. The company may soon have to do some full-scale damage control, but with public figures like Colin Kaepernick condemning it for its failure to sell top hats, it’s unclear if Nike will ever be able to recover.",NaN,2018-09-05T09:45:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--_b06dDLy--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/it78t3y1cyenawqpygao.jpg",Fake

The controversial ad, which came out yesterday, featured the slogan “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” over a tightly cropped photo of Colin Kaepernick’s face that completely cut off his chin and forehead, not to mention his neck and the rest of his body. Outrage over the excessively zoomed-in photo erupted almost immediately, with thousands of formerly loyal Nike customers expressing how disgusted they were that the company would put out an ad that was basically just some eyes and a nose.

The backlash was especially brutal on Twitter, and many users called for a total boycott of Nike products:

The sheer volume of the fallout over the polarizing ad has been absolutely devastating for Nike. Nike’s stock has already taken a hit, and with the backlash still raging, it’s safe to say that it’ll think twice before taking a photo of someone so close up ever again.

The Mystery Lives On: Researchers At Oxford Have Concluded That They’ll Never Know How Outback Steakhouse Bread Can Be So Dark Brown But Taste Regular,"It looks like one of nature’s greatest puzzles is destined to remain shrouded in mystery and confusion. Researchers at Oxford have concluded that they’ll never know how Outback Steakhouse bread can be so dark brown but taste regular.
If you were hoping for a definitive explanation of how that bread manages to look like a big slab of wood but still taste like normal bread from the supermarket, we’re sorry. Looks like you’ll just have to continue biting into Outback bread and being surprised at how regular it tastes considering how dark brown it is forever.

“Despite the great effort and resources we’ve put into understanding the incongruity between the abnormally dark color of Outback bread and its regular taste, decades of research have forced us to conclude that we will never find an adequate explanation,” said lead researcher Dr. Lawrence Knowles of Oxford’s department of chemistry. “Perhaps we will return to this riddle of the universe at some point in the future, when our technology and insight into the bread’s brownness in relation to its ordinary taste have developed further.”
While it’s disappointing that scientists have yet to find a sufficient answer, the puzzle of Outback’s bread remains a beautiful mystery, destined to capture the imagination of humankind for generations to come. For now, it looks like we must move on and allow the question of how Outback’s complimentary bread can be so extremely dark brown but still have a regular taste to remain open—an unexplained marvel of the world, and a constant reminder of just how much about our universe we have yet to understand.",NaN,2018-09-04T11:50:00-04:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--WvhK055M--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/ryahfqofxfk9uzwieg1c.jpg",Fake

The phonebook-sized volume, which is published every day in 76 countries around the world in 254 languages, reported this morning that pretty much everything in the bagel world remains relatively constant. 
“Cream cheese is basically the same as before, and bagels still have holes in them most of the time.  Nothing new to share,” the report states in a passage found on page 276, a little less than halfway through the massive publication. “Most bagels are  round, which is consistent with our findings from yesterday,” reads another notable excerpt from a 150-page subsection of the report analyzing the shape of bagels.

4 Encounters Between An Alien Civilization And A U.S. President That Didn’t Matter And Were A Big Waste Of Time,"As the leader of the free world, the president of the United States is often the first person  extraterrestrials will seek out when they want to make contact with Earth, but on the rare occasions when this happens, those meetings are almost never of consequence. Here are four encounters throughout history between a sitting U.S. president and an alien civilization that didn’t matter and were a big waste of time.
In the middle of the night of April 6, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson woke up in bed to find himself surrounded by glowing lights. His window opened and tall, gray creatures from the Andromeda Galaxy entered his room. “Woodrow Wilson, leader of Earth?” the creatures asked. “Yes, that’s me,” said President Wilson. “Look at this,” the aliens said, and they showed Woodrow Wilson a plain white T-shirt with the words “I’m The Invincible Mr. Restroom” written across it. “I don’t want that,” said President Wilson. “We weren’t offering it to you. We were just showing it to you,” said the aliens. Then they boarded their spacecraft and returned to the depths of space. Nothing got accomplished during the meeting, and it would have been better if it hadn’t happened at all.

On the evening of July 19, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was on the White House lawn contemplating the United States’ battles in World War II, when an interstellar spacecraft piloted by beings from a small planet in the distant Horsehead Nebula emerged from the sky and landed on the lawn. A glowing hatch opened on the ship and a luminescent figure radiating a silver light emerged. FDR asked the extraterrestrial, “Are you an alien from another planet?” and the alien said, “No,” and then got back into his ship and blasted off into space.
President Dwight Eisenhower was called to a military base in Roswell, NM, where army personnel had captured a downed alien spacecraft. The alien was being kept in an observation chamber, and President Eisenhower pressed his hand to the glass and said to the alien, “Why have you come here?” and the extraterrestrial, a creature whose bright blue skin was studded with bright red growths that may have been his eyes, said to President Eisenhower, “Eisenhower of Earth, know this: I have traveled 6.2 billion light-years here to tell you that there’s a being on my home planet that looks a little bit like a dumb triangular version of you.” And President Eisenhower said, “I’m going to fucking kill you,” and the alien got really scared and started screaming, and to calm him down the soldiers in the room tried to play classical music, but the sound waves of the classical music made the alien’s head explode into a shower of blue gunk. President Eisenhower looked at the puddle of alien guts on the ground and said, “That shit looks like blue sunscreen.” Then he left. It was, on the whole, a pointless encounter.

Fifty-three years ago, an alien spacecraft from the Alpha Centauri star system landed on the west lawn of the White House while President Lyndon Johnson was strolling through the Rose Garden. Translucent creatures with gigantic eyes emerged from the spacecraft and held up a football to show it to President Johnson. “Lyndon Johnson, what is this?” asked one of the aliens. “I have no fucking clue,” said President Johnson. The aliens silently turned around and got back on their ship and flew away.

Environmental Win: Conservationists Are Taking White Rhinos Off The Endangered Species List After The Bronx Zoo Found A Bunch In The Back,"For years the prognosis for the critically endangered northern white rhino has been dire, but following an incredible new discovery, the future of the subspecies is now looking bright: Conservationists are taking the imperiled rhinos off the endangered species list after the Bronx Zoo just found a bunch of them in the back.
Wow! What a fortunate break for these extraordinary creatures.
Zoologists at the Bronx Zoo excitedly called a press conference yesterday to make the bombshell announcement that the northern white rhino, a subspecies thought to have a mere two surviving female members, is now no longer at risk for extinction after they found a big pile of them lying behind some boxes of janitorial supplies in a storage room. Though the rhinos were previously believed to be beyond the point of rescue, zoo officials say there are now more than enough of the animals to repopulate the subspecies to a viable level.

“We found a whole boatload of them back there—probably 50 or 60 of the big bastards, easy,” said a spokesperson for the zoo, adding that the rhinos seemed pretty hungry but were otherwise more or less in good health. “Everybody can stop worrying about white rhinos now because we have plenty. They’ll be fine.”
Huh. Well, great, then. Glad that’s solved.
With the long-term survival of the northern white rhino now all but guaranteed, conservation groups will have millions of dollars in resources freed up to redirect toward protecting other critically endangered species. All in all, this represents a huge win not only for the rhinos but also for wildlife preservation efforts worldwide.

Mennonite Man Tests Positive for Coke,"BLUMENORT, AB
After a routine traffic stop in the small village of Blumenort, Alberta, local man Mr. Wiens has been found to have Coke in his system. Wiens faces several charges including driving under the influence of Coca-Cola and failure to consume adequate levels of Papsi.
“We haven’t found this much Coke in a Mennonite man’s system since the great Papsi shortage of ’83,” said Constable Dan. “It’s really unfortunate to see a Mennonite man get so low that he resorts to inferior cola like this.”
Wiens was held at the station overnight, but may be kept there until the Coke clears his system.
“We’ve already starting pumping him full of Papsi, but he’s pretty far gone,” said Dan. “Our only hope is that maybe, just maybe, it was Diet Coke.”
Local police have brought in boxes of Ravel bars in hope that Wiens will develop a craving for Papsi once more.
“It’s the same method we use to get people off on chai and back onto yerba mate,” said Dan. “It’s not an easy task, but it’s essential for the survival of Mennonite culture.”
It’s not known how the Coke got into Blumenort, but police are on the lookout for illegal shipments, many of which they suspect are coming from neighbouring La Crete.

Top Ten Mennonite Movies of 2018,"2018 was quite the year for Mennonite film, smashing box office records and garnering praise from both fans and critics alike. Without further ado, here are the top ten Mennonite films of 2018.
10. Crazy Rich Mennonites – This summer hit tells the tale of a rich chicken farmer from over by Blumenort who falls in love with a Mennonite girl from the wrong side of the river and tries to convince his uppity chicken farming parents to accept her for who she is: a Klassen.
9. Aunt-Man and the WASP – Aunt-Man and the WASP is about an unlikely friendship between a devout Anglican who lives in the city and a Mennonite man named Darryl who lives with his Taunte Helen.
8. Mary Siemens Returns – This delightful reboot of the 1960s Disney classic tells the tale of Mary Siemens, a fun-loving Mennonite nanny with magical powers like the ability to get children to eat plumi moos and to sing all four verses of the most difficult German hymns.
7. The Gingerich – In typical Mennonite fashion, this reboot of the Dr. Seuss classic is meaner and grumpier than the original ever was.
6. Belezean Rhapsody – This biopic documents the life of a young Mennonite lad with an overbite from the Shipyard Colony who makes it big singing in the night clubs of Belize City.
5. Mission Impossible – The latest addition to the series portrays the never-ending battle to get Uncle Peter to church on-time. Try as she might, Taunte Martha just can’t seem to get that lazy fulen out of bed on Sunday mornings!
4. Solo: The Stan Wiebe Story  – This film tells the tale of a lonely “male spinster” who lives all alone in a tiny house on the edge of Hochstadt eating beans from a can and occasionally walking into town to sit on the bench outside the local Walmart and watch the families load Corn Flakes into their minivans.

Jaws of Life Required to Extract Red Candy from Oma’s Candy Bowl,"ALTONA, MB
Emergency crews were overworked this holiday season extracting red raspberry candies that had become clumped together in Oma Penner’s candy bowl.
“Try as they might, the kids just couldn’t get a candy out of that dang bowl,” said fire chief Barney Rempel. “We’ve been responding to red candy extraction emergencies a lot this Christmas!”
Rempel says in one case the candies were stuck together so tightly that the Jaws of Life had to be utilized.
“That candy was as stubborn as Uncle Heinrich on a Sunday afternoon meddachschlop!” said Rempel. “Diewel, we sure had trouble with that thing!”
After a five-hour procedure, the candy was eventually set free and immediately given to young Abram who had been crying the entire time.
“I think these candies should be sold with an ice pick,” said Rempel. “That and a six-pack of toothbrushes.”
Oma Penner claims she bought the candies in the bulk bin at the local Co-ops where she had to recruit three teenage workers to hack away for hours at the giant mass of red sugary treats just to fill her shopping bag.",NaN,"December 28, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4040-e1546028037880.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
"La Crete, Alberta Declared “Mennonite Capital of the North”","LA CRETE, AB
The small town of La Crete, Alberta has been officially declared the northern most Mennonite town in the world and thus becomes the capital city for all Mennonite towns north of the 58th parallel. La Crete is also the only Mennonite town north of the famous “Knack Zoat Line.”
“For obvious reason, Mennonites normally never settle north of the Knack Zoat Line. If you can’t grow knack zoat, it’s very hard for Mennonites to survive!” explained local historian Peter Krahn. “For centuries Mennonites have been heading south, from Prussia to south Russia, from Canada to Mexico…and then to Paraguay, but for some reason the Mennonites of La Crete decided to go in the opposite direction.”
Being so far north, the Mennos of La Crete are heartier and harder working than any of the “lazy knack zoat-relient fulens” down south, such as the ones found down in Linden or Taber or even Coaldale.
“Those southern Mennos have it so easy with their ample supply of zoat!” said Krahn. “Unless you’ve been through a La Crete winter you just haven’t lived!”
Unfortunately for La Cretens, their capital status may soon be threatened as a schism over in Tofield has meant a new wave of migration may be imminent.
“They’re thinking of setting up shop on Baffin Island,” said Krahn. “I wish them the best of luck, but I’m pretty sure they’ll be moving back to warmer climes of far north Alberta in no time!”
Meanwhile, the Mennonites of La Crete are content to important vanilla from Mexico, yerba from Paraguay, and sunflower seeds from southern Alberta.

No Tüte for Naughty Uncle Corny This Year,"BLUMENFELD, SK
Grandma Peters has left Uncle Corny off the tüte list this year after it was discovered he had slept in and missed church three times over the past year. According to sources close to Grandma Peters, the accused is also being charged with eating more than his fair share of cheese curds at faspa.
“I know the sentence sounds harsh, but we had to send a message,” said Grandma Peters. “I hope that others will see what happened to Uncle Corny and learn their lesson!”
Uncle Corny sat alone in the corner texting a Russian woman he met online while the rest of the family opened their tüte and devoured their Mandarin oranges and peanuts.
“Around the time I turned forty, tüte started to be less of a big deal to me,” said Uncle Corny. “They no longer had the power to curb my bad behaviour that they did throughout my thirties.”
So far the rest of the Peters clan has been kept in line with the expectation of tüte at Christmas, but some are worrying that Uncle Corny may set a bad example.
“You should have seen his sheer disregard for his personal safety during the Christmas Eve candle-lighting service!” exclaimed cousin Betsy. “The man has to be punished and removing tüte is greatest punishment known to Mennonites!”
Uncle Corny says he will continue to sleep in on occasion and that he’s old enough now that, with the allowance he gets from Mom, he can buy peanuts and Juicy Fruit all on his own.",NaN,"December 26, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3836-e1545241657656.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonite Children Excited to Be Able to Say “Ox and Ass” Without Punishment Today,"BLUMENORT, MB
Mennonite children around the globe are excited for that one day a year when they receive presents, eat chocolate, and can say the word “ass” with impunity, at least within the context of “What Child Is This?”
“Normally they’d get their mouths washed out with soap for using such language,” said Grandma Schellenberg, “but on Christmas Day we make an exception.”
‘What Child Is This?’ has become a favourite among Mennonites, both young and old, for this very reason.
“Why lies he in such mean estate? Where ox and ass are feeding,'” repeated Schellenberg. “I’m sure hoping the children confine such language to the song…not like last year.”
As last year’s Schellenberg gathering, things got a little out of control, and the grandchildren were calling each other “oxen” and “asses” throughout the afternoon.
“I’m afraid this song has been a very bad influence,” said Schellenberg. “Their language needs to improve and pronto! I’m even thinking of returning the rap albums I got them for Christmas.”
Things got so crazy, that the children even started calling Uncle Pieta an “ass,” though no one at the gathering bothered to correct them.",NaN,"December 25, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/excited-e1545764040492.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake

Mennonite Woman Bravely Opts to Forgo Candle Drip-Guard,"MOUNTAIN LAKE, MN
Brave Mrs. Allison Koop, 41, decided to toss away the paper candle-wax guard during tonight’s Christmas Eve service. Koop is widely regarded as the toughest woman in Mountain Lake for her ability to put up with scalding hot wax dripping onto her hands throughout the singing of three hymns and a brief devotional by Pastor Dave.
“She’s got amazing stamina,” said Mrs. Plett. “I mean, she was basically naked out there.”
The rest of the congregation sported elaborate plastic guards to protect themselves from making any contact with the wax during the candlelight service.
“We always sing all four verses of ‘Stille Nacht,’ and by the time we’re done those candles are like molten lava,” said Mrs. Plett. “I know Mrs. Koop likes to show off how tough she is, but I also think it’s a kind of penance for her. I wonder what she did to deserve such a punishment.”
Koop denies such rumours and said the other Mennonites in town are just wimps.
“I saw Mrs. Penner come in with oven mitts last year,” said Mrs. Koop. “What on earth is this town coming to when we can’t even tolerate a little candle wax!”

How the Gingerich Stole Christmas,"BY: DR.STOLTZFUS
Every Menno down in Waterloo liked Christmas a lot,
Except for Mr. Gingerich who certainly DID NOT!
Gingerich hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
The gifts and the songs and that old Mrs. Friesen.
“Oh, why did we let a Russian Menno in here?”
Wondered sad Mr. Gingerich with a sigh and a sneer.
The Mennonites of Waterloo had wanted a change,
“But their food is so foreign and their accent is strange!”
The Friesens were permitted, if just for a test,
And Friesens, being Friesens, did what Friesens did best.
They baked and they boiled and cooked up a feast,
Of schmaunt fat and cracklings and lots of roast beast.
But old Mr. Gingerich could not stand to eat.
The sausage was too salty and the syrup was too sweet.
“Soon it will be Christmas and then what will that bring?
Nothing but presents and games and four-part singing!”
He went to the church and looked down from the top,
“They can do it in Winkler, but here it must stop!”
So he hatched up a scheme, while the rest were in song.
“I have an idea: let’s say everything’s wrong!”
He spoke to the elders who agreed with his plan.
“Joy can’t be from God. It must be from man.”
And so it came out, as if by royal decree:
“Christmas must end!” said the elders with glee.
“Laughing and playing and speaking out of place,
Will get you a shunning and a pie in the face.”
So the Mennos became somber and the season got dark,
The lights were turned off and the whole town was stark.
There was no celebration of the saviour’s birth,
No gifts and no gatherings and certainly not mirth.
Until little Cindy of Waterloo, stood out from the crowd.
“I have something to say, if I may be allowed.
I think we’ve been fooled, we’ve followed their trick.
Why must Christmas be dreadful, and awful, and sick?”
Then wee little Cindy held out her wee little hand.
“Hello, Mr. Gingerich,” as she helped him to stand.
Then she hauled out a hymnal, and turned to a page.
At first he was furious and started to rage.
Cindy grabbed for his hand, his fingers like sticks.
And pointed to the words of Hymn 606.
And with tears in his eyes, Gingerich started to glow.
“Praise God from whom all blessings flow.”
“It’s been years,” he said, “since I’ve sung this song.”
“It’s been years,” he repeated. “It should not have been so long.”
“So bring on Christmas!” he said with a smile.
“Let’s get out the Dutch Blitz and stay for a while!”
So the Mennos in Waterloo decided to play,
While Mr. Gingerich’s heart grew three sizes that day.",NaN,"December 23, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-11-16-at-9.34.54-PM-e1542425955640.png?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Local Mennonite Church Becomes First Ever to Make it All the Way Through ‘Der Friedensfürst’ Without Messing Up,"WITMARSUM, BRAZIL
The EMMBC church of Witmarsum, Brazil is in celebration tonight after becoming the first Mennonite church ever to successfully make it through the complex four-part harmonies of ‘Der Friedensfürst‘ without a single screw up.
“I can’t believe we did it,” said music director Mrs. Ens. “We’ve been singing this song every December for decades and someone always messes up. Usually a tenor.”
While the bass and tenor section were able to sing “Wunderbar, wunderbar!” with gusto, they often got all confused with the “Drum besingt den ruhm des herrn,” part.
“Plus you always have some man in the back start in on ‘hörst sie lieblich schallen.'” That throws everything off,” said Mrs. Ens. “I’ve been talking to the Pauls brothers for years. I even tried to get them to practice during the off-season, but to no avail.”
The successful flawless performance of ‘Der Friedensfürst‘ was recorded and broadcast on YouTube for Mennonites around the world to see.
“It’s truly a wonder to behold,” said Mrs. Toews of Lomo Plata. “If those Mennonites down in Witmarsum can pull it off, it gives hope for all of us.”
Despite the arduous challenge, more than three thousand Mennonite congregations will get trying to match the Witmarsum feat throughout the Christmas season.

Mrs. Friesen’s Plumi Moos Now 100% Mouse Free,"HOCHFELD, MB
Mrs. Friesen would like to clear up a misunderstanding that has been going on for years: her world famous plumi moos contains nothing but plums.
“It’s vegan,” said Mrs. Friesen. “No mice involved. Not a single one. Never has, and, Lord willing, never will.”
Friesen claims that her grandkids have been reluctant to try her moos for this very reason.
“They seem to think it contains some rodents of some sort,” said Mrs. Friesen. “It’s very hard to convince them otherwise.”
Friesen says she once force-fed young Timmy and saying, “Here, try this. Would a mouse taste this delicious?” but, apparently, the experience of having his grandmother pin back his arms and pry a spoon full of cold plum soup in his mouth did not improve his opinion on the matter.
“He still won’t try it,” says Friesen. “Oh, well, I guess it’s just more for the adults.”
Friesen says she has also managed to keep the kids from finding out what farmer sausage casings are really made from.

Local Families Gather to Watch Delightful Holiday Classic ‘Grumpy Old Mennonites’,"LEAMINGTON, ON
Anabaptist families across North America are going to be glued to their TV sets tonight for the annual airing of the holiday classic ‘Grumpy Old Mennonites.’ The film stars Walter Neufeld and Jack Loeppky as two old Mennonite men who just can’t get along and complain about absolutely everything.
“It’s basically a documentary,” says Mrs. Plett. “There’s a reason this film is so popular around here. It’s like watching real life!”
The film features numerous scenes where Neufeld calls Loeppky “a hairy old schekjbenjel,” while Loeppky pummels him with last year’s stale new years kuchen.
“I know it’s supposed to be funny,” says Mrs. Plett, “but we just watch it to get tips on how to handle these kind of situations. Because for us, the problem of grumpy old Mennonite men is no laughing matter!”
Neufeld and Loeppky disagree about nearly everything and make sure to voice their disagreement loudly and at inappropriate times in public settings.
“Trudeau vs. Trump, vereniki vs. kielke, Maple Leafs vs. Vanapag Jats – you name it, they argue about it,” said Mrs. Plett. “They also love loudly pontificating on controversial social issues that they know little about other than what they saw on some stupid Internet meme.”
During the commercial breaks, the network is planning to hold a telethon to raise money to support families who have to suffer the presence of grumpy old Mennonites.
“Any donation helps,” says Mrs. Plett. “Even a dollar or two will get me that much closer to my goal of spending the holidays all alone on a secluded beach in the Caribbean.”",NaN,"December 20, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/grump.jpeg?resize=678%2C351,Fake
Nintendo Releases New Game for Mennonite Children,"MARTENSVILLE, SK
Video game giant Nintendo has just released a new 8-bit game called Super Martens Bros. with the intent of capturing the last demographic they did not yet have: Mennonites.
“Super Martens Bros. is an exciting new game featuring Corny and Abe Martens, two trajchtmoakas from Jantsied who are trying to rescue Princess Aganetha,” said a Nintendo spokesperson. “Let me tell you, you’ve never seen a game quite like this!”
Video game experts IGN have already given the game a 8.5/10 saying that “it’s even better than the original!”
“I think this is the game that will finally get Mennonites to abandon their traditional prohibition against electronic devices and finally give video games a whirl,” said IGN. “Super Martens Bros. is a game for the whole family!”
The new game comes prepackaged in a new Nintendo system along with the classic Duck Hunt, although this time the gun is not provided.
“Mennonites don’t use guns,” said IGN. “So, this time they’ll be expected to take down the ducks with prayer and supplication.”

Local Man Forgets His Apple ID Password Yet Again,"NEW BOTHWELL, MB
Area man Ernie Rempel, 47, had to reset his Apple ID password yet again this morning, after he went to purchase the Hientje Christmas album on iTunes and discovered he no longer remembers “waut de schissjat” his password was.
“Here we go again,” said Ernie. “HotMenno47? No, that’s not it. MennoLover1975? No! Ugh, this is so frustrating!”
Part of the problem, explains Ernie, is the fact that he’s had to change his password so often over the years, and he can’t just use the same one he uses for, like, gmail and stuff.
“You have to have an uppercase letter and a word and a number and it can’t be anything I’ve ever used before!” exclaimed Ernie. “Well, who do they think I am? I’m not capable of coming up with new original passwords all the time!”
Ernie says he’s settled on a password that no one will ever be able to guess.
“It’s an awesome password,” said Ernie. “It’s so good, even I will never be able to guess it!”

“Oba yo! The Klippenstein boys always made fun of me for driving a Japanese truck, but now they can’t say nothing. The Platz is the coolest car around,” said Corny Wall of Grunthal. “I bet this car goes zero to 60 in less than three bites of platz.”
The Toyota Platz features a large trunk for storing ice cream pails of Mrs. Wall’s famous rhubarb platz, although the trunk will serve other purposes as well.
“You can even put jars of pickled beets in there yet,” said Corny. “Diewel, this car is spashal!”
It’s not known why the Platz was originally only sold in Japan, but experts say it did increase Japanese interest in all things Mennonite.
“They were thinking of coming out with the Toyota Formavorscht, but the logo was a little too suggestive,” said industry expert Mr. Funk. “All I can say is I’m happy to have the Platz right here in Canada. I mean this car is amazing. It’s positively delicious!”

Grandchildren Completely Baffled by Oma’s Gesangbuch,"LANDMARK, MB
Oma was very excited to sing out of the old German Gesangbuch with all the grandkids at the Plett Christmas gathering this Sunday, but soon realized things weren’t going to go nearly as smoothly as she expected.
“Not only can they not read sheet music, but they have absolutely no clue what ‘O du Frohliche‘ even means!” exclaimed Oma Plett. “What on earth are they even teaching at that so-called Sunday school of theirs!”
The Pletts were half-way through the first verse of ‘Ihr Kinderlein kommet‘ when things started to fade out and only Oma was left singing.
“She’s the only one who really knows the songs,” said young Peter. “I usually attempt to sing. I give it an honest try, but eventually I just get tongue-tied with all the umlauts and all that.”
While some family members managed to hum along to the familiar tune of ‘Welch ein Jubel, Welche Freude‘, Oma ended up singing ‘Ich klopfe an‘ as a solo.
“My goodness these young people are in a pretty sad state,” said Oma. “I mean once you get past ‘Stille nacht, heilige nacht‘, they’re completely lost.”",NaN,"December 16, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4241-e1544386984624.jpeg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
"Mexican Mennonite Purchases Snowmobile, Prays for White Christmas","CUAUHTEMOC, MEXICO
After his cousins Pieta and Johan extolled the virtues of a snowy white Christmas, Guillermo Krahn of Cuauhtemoc decided to purchase a snowmobile and have it shipped down to Mexico in anticipation of a winter that never came. That was in 2010.
“We don’t get much snow in the desert,” said Krahn. “My frintschoft up in Canada are always posting photos on Instagram of all their winter adventures. Looks like a lot of fun. Except Pieta had some nasty frostbite on his ears. That was a picture I didn’t need to see.”
Krahn has got his sled all tuned up, but, so far, he has been unable to use it.
“I tried it out on the field once. Killed a few rattlesnakes,” explained Krahn. “But I’m really hoping this is the year I’ll be able to use the thing properly yet.”
The Chihuahua region does get snow on occasion, but usually, Krahn explains, it only arrives after the unceasing prayers and fasting of the local Mennonite population.
“And by the time the evening service is over, it’s gone,”  said Krahn, “but this year I’ll be ready.”
Krahn has also purchased something called a “toque,” which his cousins say is absolutely necessary during a white Christmas.
“I must say, it looks pretty ridiculous,” said Krahn. “You Canadian Mennonites are a pretty crazy bunch.”

Fight Breaks Out Between Winkler’s Top Two Fäasenjas ,"WINKLER, MB
Two of Winkler’s most noted Fäasenjas broke out into a fist fight this Sunday at the Christmas service. They were right in the middle of “Lobt Gott Ihr Christen Allzugleich,” when Mr. Wiebe slugged Mr. Penner in the jaw.
“He was way out of tune again,” said Mr. Wiebe, “and he kept messing up the tempo. I just couldn’t take it anymore. He had this coming!”
Mr. Wiebe says Mr. Penner has been doing this for years and doesn’t know how Mr. Penner kept his job as a Fäasenja.
“I mean, even Mr. Blatz would be better,” said Mr. Wiebe. “Somebody had to put a stop to this madness!”
Mr. Wiebe had Mr. Penner in a headlock, before the third Fäasenja, Mr. Klassen, stepped in.
“Oba, gentlemen, there’s plenty of Fäasenjing for everyone,” he said. “Gentleman! Gentlemen, please get a hold of yourself.”
When an errant punch landed in Mr. Klassen’s face, he, too, became involved in the altercation.
“Unfortunately, we’ve had to replace them all,” said Pastor Johan. “But I guess it’s not all bad. We needed to make a change around here anyway.”

Mennonite Woman Deliberately Leaves Out Essential Ingredient When Sharing Recipe,"CHILLIWACK, BC
Mrs. Brandt of Chilliwack has often been asked to share her delicious recipes with others, but, so far, not a single person has been able to replicate her dishes.
“I don’t know what it is, but whenever I cook up a batch of Mrs. Brandt’s Famous Summa Borscht, it feels like there’s something missing,” said local mom Susan Wiebe. “Oh, well, I guess I’m just not the cook that Mrs. Brandt is.”
Mrs. Brandt claims it’s all in the technique and says it doesn’t surprise her at all that other people struggle to match her greatness.
“You can use my recipes if you want, but I guarantee you, it’ll never taste the same,” said Mrs. Brandt. “These young cooks just don’t know what they’re doing.”
Mrs. Brandt says she provided more than a dozen recipes to her daughter-in-law Lucy, and, yet, for some strange reason, her son still makes a point of stopping by for home cooking once in a while.
“Lucy is a nice girl, but she can’t cook like I can!” exclaimed Mrs. Brandt. “Try as you might to cook my recipes, you can never beat the real thing!”
Mrs. Brandt denies rumours that she’s been deliberately sabotaging the recipes and claims that she “never has any troubles.”

"CBC Bans Popular Plautdietsch Christmas Song ‘Frü, Daut es Kold Büte!’","TORONTO, ON
Executives at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation have decided to ban the popular Plautdietsch holiday tune ‘Frü, Daut es Kold Büte’, after thousands of Canadians complained they didn’t know what the heck the words even meant.
“It’s a catchy melody, I guess,” said Mrs. Brandt, “but what on earth do the lyrics even mean? Is it even really a Christmas song?”
There were a lot of rumours about the song, including the idea that it was about an illicit yerba-fueled yuletide affair.
“Some people say the song is all about drinking yerba mate and making love in the hayloft,” said Mrs. Brandt. “That hardly seems like appropriate Christmas material to me.”
Not a single Canadian was able to translate the lyrics, except for a couple hundred people in southern Manitoba, most of whom ban the radio anyway. CBC says it will replace the potentially offensive song with “more appropriate” lyrics from contemporary pop artists.",NaN,"December 12, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/audio-e1544581517866.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonites Excited for New Tolkien Prequel,"HOLLYWOOD, CA
Mennonite geeks across North America have been filled with anticipation over the recently announced prequel to Tolkien’s Middle-earth series. Peter Jackson released teaser trailers this week for the new movie, tentatively titled The Hiebert: An Unexpected Journey to Hochstadt.
“Oba, yo. I’ve been waiting to see The Hiebert brought to the big screen my whole life,” said Derrick Wiebe on Reddit. “I’ve always known the Hieberts have hairy feet, but now I’ll be able to see them for myself!”
The Hiebert tells the tale of a young Bill B. Hiebert who is reluctantly lured by an old Mennonite elder to take a journey to Hochstadt with a bunch of smelly Duecks to liberate some precious, precious hymnals being held captive by the evil Mr. Siemens.
“It’s based on a discarded family history book found at the MCC,” said Wiebe. “I’ve read it dozens of times myself. I even have a Hiebert or two in my own family’s genealogy. Really exciting stuff!”
The Hiebert contains several scary encounters with foul-breathed Mr. Siemens that young Mennonites might find disturbing.
“Mr. Siemens is big and ugly and can strike you down with just a glance in your direction,” said Wiebe. “I was in his Sunday School class over in Chortitz for a few years and, let me tell you, he’s a no-nonsense kind of guy.”
Reports indicate that director Peter Jackson is planning to stretch out the rather short book into six or seven movies to capitalize on the lucrative “Menno-geek” market.

Local Pastor ‘Fuming Mad’ He Wasn’t Invited to ‘First Ministers Meeting’,"MONTREAL, QC
A pastor of a small town Mennonite church was absolutely furious this week after he found out he did not get in invite to the First Ministers meeting in Montreal.
“What, so the Premier of Alberta gets an invite, but the associate minister and part-time Sunday School co-ordinator at West Leamington Mennonite does not?” exclaimed Minister Fehr. “This is an outrage!”
Minister Fehr has been heading up West Leamington for the past ten years and he has always considered himself a leader in the community.
“And then not to be invited to high level meetings with the Prime Minister,” said Fehr. “It’s like a slap in the face!”
Fehr says he’s so upset that he just might threaten to cut off the quilt supply that’s been flowing out of Leamington for decades.
“If they don’t even invite us to the table, then maybe they’d like to see how they do without our comfy quilts this winter!” said Fehr. “You can’t call a First Ministers meeting and not have Mennonite minister representation. I mean, they should at least invite the Fäasenja!”

Left Lane Between Steinbach and Blumenort to be Designated “Slow Minivan Lane”,"BLUMENORT, MB
After extensive traffic studies on Highway 12 north of Steinbach this summer, the Manitoba Road Authority has decided to designate the left lane to be used exclusively by families driving excruciatingly slow and/or turning left into Blumenort at the last second from a few lanes over.
“The lane is going to be clearly marked in blue and the speed limit will be reduced to 40 km/h,” said a government spokesperson. “You must have a high-mileage minivan to enter the lane.”
The signs on the highway will be changed to encourage slow drivers to “keep left or right. It’s totally up to you.”
“I think it’ll take some time to get used to the new system,” she said, “but eventually I think we’ll see a general slow-down of highway traffic to a more reasonable 50 or 60 kms below the current limit.””
Drivers who don’t like the new system are cautioned against using the shoulder to pass someone and are warned that such an action can result in a significant fine.
“If you want to drive at normal speed, you can take the gravel roads,” she said. “Sure, you’ll get a few stone chips, but at least you’ll be freeing up some space for all the minivans.”

Mennonite Man Attends His First Vanapag Jats Game,"VANAPAG, MB
Local man, Abraham Krahn of North Kildonan, was thrilled to get some free tickets to see his favourite hockey team the Vanapag Jats in action last night against the St. Louis Blues.
“Its my farst NHL game aver,” said Krahn. “I was really ax-cited for the game. My boss, Mr. Wiebe, said the bast schekjbenjel of the month gats to see the Jats at the Ball MTS Place and this time the bast schekjbenjel was me yet!”

“Oba, I yust like his play-making abalaty,” said Krahn. “I used to like Laine, but dan he shaved his beard off and left the Mannanite charch completely. Nah, junges!”
Krahn is very grateful to his employer, Mr. Wiebe, for the tickets, which have a face value of well over a hundred dollars.
“Going to a hockey game can be quite pricey these days,” said Krahn. “If the Vanapag Jats are this expensive, I just can’t imagine how much the Winnipeg Jets would be!”
Krahn is saving ten percent of his chicken-catching money every week, and plans to attend a real Winnipeg Jets game sometime this spring.

Local Pastor Preaches Hour-Long Sermon About Why ‘Die Hard’ is a Christmas Movie,"OMAHA, NE
An associate pastor at East Omaha Mennonite was so desperate to connect with his congregation that he spent a full hour during the service this week pontificating on why the 1980s classic action film ‘Die Hard’ should be considered a Christmas movie.
“There are basically two schools of thought on the subject,” explained Pastor Ron. “Either you believe ‘Die Hard’ is not a Christmas movie, like the heathens and Calvinists, or you follow the clear teaching of Scripture that proclaims the Christmasness of the entire ‘Die Hard’ franchise.”
Pastor Ron pointed out that the film is set at “freaking Christmas time, my bros!” and also cited the fact it has a pregnant character, “just like in the Bible, my dudes!” as proof of his thesis.
“This is just one in my series of sermons on such relevant topics as ‘Should Hermione have ended up with Harry Potter?’, ‘Britney vs. Christina’, and ‘Did the spinning top fall at the end of Inception?'” explained Pastor Ron. “If you want to reach people these days, you’ve gotta stay relevant.”
Pastor Ron is planning a screening of ‘Die Hard’ in the youth room after church, but has asked everyone in attendance to refrain from yelling ‘Yippee ki-kay, mother____er.’
“Or at least when the senior pastor is around,” said Pastor Ron. “You know how he gets.”",NaN,"December 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/sermon-e1543025512620.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonite Couple Covered in Flour After Things Get Frisky in the Kitchen,"GRUNTHAL, MB
Mom and Dad had some explaining to do after the Dueck children found them in a state of disrobe and completely covered in flour when they were dropped off at home by grandma.
“We were baking,” explained Mrs. Dueck to her baffled children. “You know how Dad gets when I bake. He can’t help but get involved.”
Mr. Dueck was quick to confirm his wife’s explanation of the situation.
“You see, children, when a man and woman love each other very much, sometimes they like to go to the kitchen and make sugar cookies together,” explained Mr. Dueck. “Here try one…they’re delicious.”
The kids were reluctant to try the finished product and Mrs. Dueck quickly steered the conversation in another direction when the topic of the spatula was raised.
“The spatula comes in real handy when I’m flipping Mom’s cookies,” said Mr. Dueck. “At first my technique was all off, but she says I’m getting better at it all the time.”

Court Rules 69-Year-Old Dutch Man is Actually a ‘Whiny Little Toddler’,"ARNHEM, NETHERLANDS
A Dutch court has ruled today that local senior Milan Ratelbrand, 69, is actually legally “one-and-half years old, or two at best.” Ratelbrand had sued the government to have his age lowered by a couple decades so he could have sex with younger strangers he met on the Internet, but the court found he was actually much younger than even Ratelbrand had claimed.
“He was trying to be branded as a 49-year-old,” said the judge, “but when we assessed his maturity and mental age, we found he wasn’t much better than a whiny little toddler.”
The judge has ordered Ratelbrand to suck his thumb from now on and have his diaper changed by a trained professional at least once a day.
“He didn’t like the ruling and immediately threw a fit,” said the judge. “They call it the terrible twos for a reason.”
The ruling has already had a deterrent effect on other frivolous lawsuits.
“If you want to have your age lowered, you’ll have to be happy with however old we think you are,” said the judge. “Looks like it’s back to the nursery school for Mr. Ratelbrand.”
Ratelbrand had scheduled a press conference to respond to the ruling, but it had to be cancelled since he was way too occupied banging all the pots and pans together in his mother’s kitchen.

Mennonites Desperately Search for Cheap Used Netflix Subscriptions at MCC Store,"HERBERT, SK
Mennonites across Canada have been scouring the shelves at their local MCC thrift stores in search of used Netflix subscriptions after the streaming service jacked up the prices this week.
“I heard Mrs. Friesen got a slightly soiled Netflix subscription here just a few days ago,” said Mrs. Wiebe of Herbert, Saskatchewan. “I’m hoping I can score a gently used Netflix subscription myself.”
Mrs. Penner, also of Herbert, managed to scoop up a previously owned Netflix subscription for just 5 cents, though she admits the pricing might have been an error.
“What a deal! It had only a slight hairline crack,” said Mrs. Penner. “So, whoever was pricing this Netflix subscription didn’t know what a valuable item they had! I love it when they let the men price the housewares!”
The Thiessen family of Herbert have snatched up dozens of used Neflix subscriptions in the last couple days.
“Once the MCC runs out, we’re going to make a killing!” said Mr. Thiessen. “Plus, I also bought out all their old Monopoly games with missing pieces! Can anyone say Christmas gifts? Cha-ching!”
Mennonite residents of Saskatoon, however, will continue to use the same strategy to save on Netflix that they always have – skirting the rules by sharing the same password with everyone in their Bible Study group.

Local woman, Mrs. Loewen, has been a self-described “huge fan” of evangelist brothers The Sutera Twins ever since they held meetings in the Steinbach Tabernacle many decades ago.
“Oba, yo, I drove in from Mitchell in the back of my father’s pickup truck,” said Mrs. Loewen nee Hiebert. “Their fiery preaching and lively music was like nothing I’d ever heard around here before.”
Loewen says she came up to the front more than a dozen times a revival meetings in the Steinbach area.

Local Heart Surgeon Locates Jesus,"WINKLER, MB
A local surgeon has finally discovered the exact location of Jesus in the human heart. Just this past week, Dr. Penner opened up Mr. Klassen’s ticker and found Jesus.
“Scientists have been trying to find Jesus in the human heart for decades and I’ve finally done it,” said Dr. Penner. “He’s located between the aorta and left atrium. And to think, I had been looking for Jesus in the right ventricle this whole time!”
According to Dr. Penner’s research, when children ask “Jesus into their hearts” he immediately wedges himself right there near the mitral valve.
“I plan to publish my findings in the Adventures in Odyssey magazine,” said Dr. Penner. “It’s the closest thing to a peer-reviewed journal I could find.”
Dr. Penner says he’s done a few other open-heart surgeries and sometimes he finds nothing.
“Sometimes I open these people up and there’s nothing but blood and veins and stuff,” said Dr. Penner. “It’s really sad…and quite the mess.”

Mr. Ralph Ens of North Kildonan sat himself down at the end of the pew this past Sunday and was perfectly content to have each and every person climb over him to take their seats.
“I asked him to scooch over a bit, but he just glared at me and said there was plenty of room to get by,” said Mrs. Friesen. “But there wasn’t plenty of room…even when he tucked in his knees a bit.”
Although Mr. Ens’ refusal to scooch drew criticism from some church members, others praised him for his uncompromising stance.
“I’m glad to see it! Finally there’s a man willing to stand up for his rights!” exclaimed Elder Pankratz. “Scooching over is so emasculating!”
Whatever the case, Mr. Ens’ refusal to scooch left other parishioners with quite the quandary. Mrs. Loewen was baffled about the whole situation and contemplated her strategy.
“When I slide by him, should I face forwards or backwards?” wondered Mrs. Loewen. “Either way, this whole situation has got me more than a little worried.”
There has been some talk of adding more space between the pews, but the elders always vote against it, citing the tight quarters as “just one more thing that binds us together as a church community.”

"Mennonite Woman Dies, Donates Her Organs","CHORTITZ, SK
Local woman Mrs. Wiebe passed away peacefully in her sleep this past Sunday. Thankfully, however, she signed her organ donor card and her wide selection of electric home organs have gone to someone who needs them.
“Mennonite churches are begging people to sign their organ donor cards,” said head of the local music department Mrs. Penner. “You’re not going to need your organs when you die, so if they’re still in working condition, we’d love to have them.”
It’s estimated that Mrs. Wiebe’s organs saved more than a dozen lives.
“Considering their age, her Wurlitzers were in remarkable shape,” said Mrs. Penner. “I bet Mrs. Wiebe would be excited to see her organs playing the Doxology in churches across Saskatchewan.”
Mrs. Penner hopes that Mrs. Wiebe’s generosity will be noted by others with gently used organs.
“It’s always sad when a loved one passes away, but it’s nice to see that her organs did not go to waste,” said Mrs. Penner. “I urge everyone to sign their organ donor card. They don’t even have to be Hammonds. We’ll take any organs in working condition.”
Mrs. Penner assures concerned donors that if you entrust your organs to her, they will never ever be used to play rock songs.

Spoiler Alert: Simba is Pacifist in New ‘Lion King’ Remake,"HOLLYWOOD, CA
In an effort to clean up the violent image of the previous film, the good folks at Disney have made a refreshing change to the new Lion King movie. Instead of defeating the evil Scar in an epic bloody battle, as had originally been planned, at the last minute the producers decided to go with a more “pacifist” version of Simba, now known as Simba Loewen from Yantsied.
“First he goes on a hunger strike,” said Disney executive Andrew Jansen. “You know, to draw attention to the plight of lions in the savannah.”
The story follows Simba Loewen’s journey from hunger striker to Conscientious Objector. He even spends some time in a logging camp out in the mountains, where he builds roads, reads his Bible, and sings German hymns with all CO buddies.
“It’s a heart-warming story to be sure. And not a drop of blood is shed,” said Jansen. “Oh, sure Mustafa’s kingdom is overthrown and taken over by Scar, but that’s a small price to pay.”
In the second half of the film, Simba Loewen spends all his time volunteering to fix old electronics at the local MCC thrift store. The new Lion King movie debuts in Mennonite church basements this week.

Mennonite Cooking to Be Rebranded as ‘Keto Diet’,"ALTONA, MB
In an effort to capitalize on the latest fad diet, the ladies at the local Mennonite church have decided to rebrand ‘The EMMC Ladies Cookbook’ as simply ‘Cooking Keto.’ The ladies decided to make the change when they found out that the ketogenic diet is nothing but cheese, meat, and fat.
“Hey, Mennonites have been doing the Keto Diet for centuries,” said Mrs. Friesen. “It’s nice to see the rest of the world has finally caught up with us.”
The new cookbook features traditional Mennonite recipes that have been rebranded to reach the Keto customer.
“Oma’s formavorscht and schinkefleish are incredibly high in protein and fat!” said Mrs. Friesen. “And schmaunt fat? I mean it’s got the word ‘fat’ in the name. What could more Keto than that!”
Health experts plan to study the Mennonite population to examine the long term effects of eating nothing but meat.
“Somehow they’ve survived for centuries without any vegetable intake,” said Dr. Palmer. “We’re also going to sample the local German population as they seem to be similarly Keto.”
The EMMC ladies also have another version of the cookbook that features nothing but pickled beets and green bean soup that is meant to appeal to the hardcore vegan crowd.

Friesen Family Musical Ensemble Breaks Up,"LINDEN, AB
The Friesen Family Singers have ended their eight year career at the top of the Mennonite family gospel ensemble charts. For almost a decade the Friesens have toured church basements across the Canadian prairies, surpassing even the popularity of the Penner Family Singers, but now their reign has come to an end.
“There was infighting and Martha wanted to go solo,” said Mr. Friesen. “It’s really too bad, because I think we had a really good thing going.”
After years of success and adulation, it seems the egos had grown just too large.
“Once Timmy’s voice started to change we had to give his parts to young Erin. That was the beginning of the end, I think,” said Mr. Friesen. “After that we just didn’t have the unity we once had when we first started.”
Things really unravelled at a recent performance at the South Linden Gospel Mennonite fall fundraiser. Linda and Betty were leading out on “There’s Power in the Blood,” when Alex stormed off the stage in a huff and yelled, “Jauma lied! I’m done with this yet!”
The breakup of the Friesen Family Singers has disappointed their millions of fans, but most have said it’s really Yoko Ono’s fault.

Steinbachers to Vote on Whether to Legalize Romaine Lettuce,"STEINBACH, MB
After dozens of people have taken ill from E. coli-tainted romaine lettuce, Steinbach city council decided it was time to see how locals felt about this dangerous and addictive substance.
“We’re gonna do what we always do in Steinbach with issues like this: absolve ourselves of responsibility by holding a plebiscite in the old folk’s home,” said city councilor Pieta Ratzlaff. “The question is simple: ‘Should romaine lettuce be sold in Steinbach stores? Yo or Nay?'”
With a hot topic like romaine lettuce, Steinbach politicians were nervous about taking a position on the issue. Most answers were rather wishy-washy.
“I could go either way on this. I mean, I think it’s a complex issue. I mean, there are two sides to everything. Consumption of something like romaine lettuce is a personal choice,” said Mr. Ratzlaff. “I’ll be very curious to hear what all the tax payers think of this issue.”
Early polls suggest, Steinbach seniors voters were overwhelmingly in favour of banning any kind of non-pickled vegetable in the city.
“If it grows in the ground, we don’t want it in town!” yelled one man.
“If it isn’t meat, it ain’t proper to eat!” yelled another.
The referendum will also ask the people whether they want to purchase laptops for city council, whether they want Harlequin or Streetheart at Summer in the City next year, and whether Miriam Toews books should be allowed in the Jake Epp Library.

Mennonite Man Wins A Million Dollars Worth of Farmer Sausage After Mr. Loeppky Scores 5 Goals in Floor Hockey Game,"ROSENORT, MB
After a stellar performance by Darren Loeppky in the EMC gymnasium this evening, one lucky member of the congregation is being awarded a million dollars, payable in farmer sausage over the next twenty years.
“The Kleine Gemeinde have been running this contest for decades and this is the first time anyone has ever won,” said Pastor Ron. “We never thought anyone would get five goals in a single floor hockey match, let alone such a schludenz as Darren Loeppky!”
The lucky winner was Pieta Kornelsen from that farm out by Morris, and he is really excited to win all that sausage.
“Oba, well, I’d like to get the million dollars of farmer sasauge all at once, but 50 grand worth a year will have to do,” said Kornelsen. “Normally the young people around here are calling me such a loser all the time, but this time I’m a real winner!”

Local Couple Starts $3.2 Trillion GoFundMe Campaign to Replace Entire US Health Care System with Canadian Health Care System,"FRESNO, CA
The Toews family of Fresno was sick and tired of the high costs and inadequate service provided by the American health care system, so they decided to start a massive GoFundMe campaign to replace the whole thing with the universal system they’ve got up there in Canada.
“Even with so-called Obamacare or Trumpcare or whatever it’s called now, there are millions of us still uninsured,” said Mr. Toews. “That’s why I’ve started this GoFundMe campaign. Our goal is to get to just over three trillion dollars by the end of the month. Anything you can provide would be greatly appreciated.”
Toews says he also plans to hold a soup and pie fundraiser in the basement of the local Mennonite church.
“We’ve got green bean soup, chicken noodle, and even a few varieties of borscht,” said Toews. “Let me tell you, if Grandma Janzen’s delicious cabbage borscht can’t get us to our 3.2 trillion dollar goal, then I don’t know what will.”
Donations are flooding in and the campaign has already raised $417, which means they only have 99.99999999999987 percent of their goal left to raise.
“The numbers are encouraging,” said Toews. “I’m certain we’ll get there with a few more tweets and a couple bake sales.”

Canadian Woman Turns to Pillar of Salt After Failing to Apply Adequate Levels of Moisturizer,"KITCHENER, ON
Emergency crews were called to a scene in Kitchener today where Alice Goossen, 43, was discovered to have completely dried out and turned into a pillar of salt after failing to apply adequate levels of moisturizer this November.
“Poor Alice. She used buckets of lotion, but it was never enough this time of year,” said family friend Susanna Toews. “I could see her skin just cracking and falling off over the last few weeks. I tried to warn her, but I guess there was nothing that could be done.”
Goosen’s solidified body is being taken to a local hospital, where it’s hoped that she can be revived and returned to normal.
“This isn’t the first case I’ve seen,” said Dr. Regehr. “Canadians always dry up like prunes this time of year. But it’s really out of hand. It’s reaching Biblical proportions.”
Others are not quite so convinced that lack of moisturizer was what did Mrs. Goossen in.
“She’s a Kitchener girl,” said Mrs. Toews. “But I think on occasion she turned around and longed to be in Waterloo.”
Not wanting to dismiss any possibilities, authorities are warning Canadians to stay moisturized this winter…and also avoid turning around to take a glance back at Waterloo.

Trump Invites Saudi Crown Prince to Share Thanksgiving Dinner,"WASHINGTON, DC
Spirits were high and there was an air of celebration at the White House today, as the Saudi Crown Prince agreed to join President Trump for a lovely Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday.
“I’ve gotta say, with friends like this, you’ve gotta pull out all the stops,” said Trump, dipping his Chick-fil-A into some sweet and spicy sriracha. “It’s a time to celebrate. We have a lot to be thankful for.”
Trump called Saudi Arabia, which has faced numerous accusations of human rights abuses over the years, “our closest friends in the world…especially after that fiasco with the Canadian dairy farmers.”
After the meal, the two world leaders gathered in the Oval Office for a game of Fortnite.
“Thanksgiving is a special time to enjoy together with your closest friends and family,” said Trump. “Plus, I hear he’s pretty good at this.”
The festivities went on for a number of hours, before the two chums were just plain tuckered out and crashed in each other’s arms on a couch in the West Wing.
“Would you look that? Aren’t they cute?” said Press Secretary Sanders, who found the two of them spooning. “I mean I just love Thanksgiving. Gives me the warm fuzzies all over.”
A press release confirmed the Thanksgiving meeting, although journalists were absolutely forbidden from taking any pictures or asking any questions.

‘Menno’s Rights Activists’ Burn Their Suspenders in Massive Bonfire,"ABBOTSFORD, BC
In honour of International Mennos Day, thousands of Menno’s Rights Activists have been gathering in church basements around the world today to bring awareness to the “shackles placed on Mennonite men by an oppressive society.”
In this case, those shackles are, quite literally, the suspenders on their backs. One event in Abbotsford saw almost a hundred Menno’s Rights Activists burn their suspenders in the parking lot of the EMBBC Church.
“Down with suspenders!” shouted Mr. Loewen flinging his suspenders onto the pile. “And down with beards. I can’t really grow a proper one anyway yet!”
In addition to facial hair and suspenders, the group has highlighted many additional challenges that they claim are unique to Mennonite men, such as health issues arising from years of unprotected contact with cow manure.
“Oba, I don’t tink people realize how hard it is for us Mannanite men yet,” said Mr. Loewen. “How about if we switch with the women for once and see how they like it?”
Local Mennonite women said they didn’t that idea was half bad and were immediately enthusiastic about the proposal.
“I’m sure the quality of roll kuchen would decline a little,” said Mrs. Fehr, “but the sermons would get a lot better, let me tell you.”
At press time, a committee made up entirely of men is studying the issue.

Hungry President Trump Reluctantly Pardons Delicious Hutterite Turkey,"WASHINGTON, DC
In his greatest act of selflessness and humility since taking the Oval Office, President Donald Trump pardoned a delicious Hutterite-raised turkey today. Trump will now have to dine on inferior store-bought turkeys this Thanksgiving.
“Boy, I’m famished,” said Trump as he reluctantly pardoned the turkey. “I’d really like to dine on this Hutterite turkey. I’ve heard they’re the best. But I guess it’s Chick-fil-A again tonight.”
Upon hearing the news that Mr. Trump with go through Thanksgiving without the taste of Hutterite poultry, Mrs. Waldner of Purple Haze Colony in South Dakota decided to search in her deep freeze to see what she could offer.
“My freezer is packed with Hutterite poultry,” said Mrs. Waldner. “I usually sell them to desperate neighbouring Mennonites-in-need, who just can’t produce a product like this. However, I’ve got so many that I’m willing to let one go in service to the country.”

White House Returns Jim Acosta’s Press Pass After He Joins Pacifist Mennonite Church,"WASHINGTON, DC
Days after having his press pass revoked following a controversial incident with a White House intern, CNN reporter Jim Acosta is now “back in business” after agreeing to meet with a local Mennonite pastor.
“I figured joining one of the historic peace churches wouldn’t hurt,” said Acosta, who was dropped off at the White House in a horse-and-buggy. “After studying the Sermon on the Mount with Pastor Johan, I now believe I have the self-control to “turn the other microphone,” as the Lord commands.”
Beyond pacifism, Acosta says he’s also been learning other things from the Mennonites.
“I’ve been spending a lot of time over the past couple days hauling manure at the Hochstetter farm,” said Acosta. “I think this activity has prepared me more than anything else to be a CNN White House correspondent.”
Donald Trump says he’s happy to see a “new and improved Jim Acosta” back in the White House.
“It’s tremendous, just tremendous,” said Trump. “I can assure Mr. Acosta that I will carefully consider his questions and answer with the same frankness and respect that I always have.”
According to sources, the new press pass was printed off this afternoon on the old dot matrix printer in the basement of Mennonite church over there in Intercourse.

Blue Bombers Proudly Hoist ‘Sunday School Attendance’ Trophy,"WINNIPEG, MB
After a loss to the Calgary Stampeders this afternoon, the Winnipeg Blue Bomber season has come to an end yet again, and yet again this year, the club is excited to have achieved absolutely all of their goals. Players were especially brimming about the Sunday School Participation trophies they received from Mrs. Friesen’s class.
“All our hard work has finally paid off,” said one Bomber player and Sunday School attendee. “To hoist this cheap plastic trophy and see all those stickers in my notebook is a real thrill.”
The award is the highest honour the football team has received in almost three decades.
“Let Ottawa or Calgary have their Grey Cups,” said the player. “We’ve got the love and respect of Mrs. Friesen and that’s all we need.”
As the Blue Bombers enter the long cold off-season, they’re planning to really work on memorizing their verses so that maybe they can go to summer camp next year instead of like, you know, playing football.

‘Iron Maiden’ Performs to Sold Out Crowd at Local Mennonite Church,"ELIDA, OH
There was some confusion with the local metal community after tickets they had purchased to see UK heavy metal icons ‘Iron Maiden’ turned out to be a performance by a single Mennonite woman named Ms. Roth.
“I mean her autoharp playing was not bad, but I really prefer the vocal stylings of Bruce Dickinson,” said local metal fan Timothy Miller. “Though, I must say, she did a pretty badass a capella version of ‘My Anchor Holds.'”
Ohio Mennonites have been calling Ms. Roth ‘the Iron Maiden’ ever since she attended Bible School for three straight years back in the 60s and didn’t even come back hitched.
“Then she was a missionary in Botswana for a couple decades,” said local man Peter Troyer. “I can’t believe she came back single.”
When she returned to America, Ms. Roth parlayed her ‘Iron Maiden’ reputation into a successful music career, performing hundreds of sold out church basement shows in Mennonite towns across the country.
“It wasn’t what I was expecting, but I’d give Ms. Roth three-and-a-half stars,” said a local metal blogger. “If you have a chance to see the Mennonite ‘Iron Maiden’ don’t pass up your chance.”

Florida Hires Expert to Help with Election Recount,"TALLAHASSEE, FL
Seemingly unable to ever get through an election without some sort of foul up, the State of Florida has hired the purple counting guy from Sesame Street to help with the recount.
“We’ve gotta get this right,” said Tallahassee resident Michael McNichols. “Counting is not one of our strong points in this state.”
The Count from Sesame Street will be taking over the recount starting tomorrow and has also been hired to restructure the state education system.
“We’ve got numeracy issues,” said McNichols. “If watching a few episodes of Sesame Street can help, then I’m all for it.”
Floridians are starting to wonder whether they’ll ever get through an election without some sort of numbering controversy.
“We spend too much time in the sun,” said McNichols. “It has a real adverse affect on our ability to retain any information beyond two digits.”
The state has reportedly also hired Cookie Monster to help teach residents about health and nutrition.

Mennonite Church Approves ‘Scandalous’ New Hemline,"SWIFT CURRENT, SK
More than thirty parishioners fainted at the Harder-Dyck wedding in Swift Current this past Sunday after the bride sported a wedding dress with an ‘outrageous’ hemline just above the ankles.
“The elders recently raised the allowable hemlines and I took full advantage of the new guidelines,” said Mrs. Harder (nee Dyck). “They even allowed my bridesmaids a full six inches above the ankle!”
Further scandal occurred at the sight of the bride’s white wedding dress, which was immediately taken as a sign of worldliness and pride.
“Oba, nay! Would you look at that!” said Mr. Loewen. “The next thing you know, they’ll be exchanging wedding rings yet!”
Mr. Loewen had to be escorted from the building after the couple did just that. It was the first time in Swift Current history that a Mennonite couple had exchanged such a sinful symbol of their undying love and commitment.

Calgarians Vote Not to Host Massive $5 Billion Faspa,"CALGARY, AB
Calgary has spoken. They do not want to host the 2026 quadrennial winter Faspa. In a plebiscite this week, Calgary voted overwhelmingly in favour of just ordering in Chinese food on that Sunday in 2026, rather than spending billions on a giant faspa and inviting the whole world.
“It’s a lot of money and there was no guarantee we were going to get the 2026 winter Faspa anyway,” said Calgarian Crystel Baerg. “There were some pretty good bids coming in from Chihuahua City and Ascuncion, so let them have it.”
It’s been more than thirty years since Calgary hosted faspa and some locals were saying it was about darn time they do it again.
“It doesn’t have to be so expensive. We could re-use a lot of the same facilities from ’88. The MB Church basement is still in pretty good shape,” said Yes-voter Diane Krahn. “I don’t know why all these nay-sayers decided against it. Hosting faspa would be great for our city!”
Also in favour of the bid were local raisin bun and cheese curd-makers.
“It’s really too bad these Calgarians are so cheap,” said Mr. Fehr of Fehrly-Good Sausages and Buns. “We would have sold millions in rolled-up slices of processed ham!”
Others have blamed the No-vote on Mennonites from the other Prairie provinces, who are known for their frugality.
“We’ve had an influx of Wiebes from Altona over the past few years,” said Mrs. Krahn. “It’s no wonder we lost. They don’t want to spend money on nothing yet!”

Mennonite Man Starts Rival Donut Shop,"GRETNA, MB
Local man Tim Hiebert was sick and tired of having his small Mennonite town constantly overlooked by the big donut and coffee chains, so he decided to do something about it himself.
“I axed myself, ‘Timotheus, why can’t you can do something about this yet?” said Tim Hiebert. “You should start a coffee shop right here in Gretna next to the Co-ops. And so I did once. And, you see, there it is right over on the other side next to the Co-ops.”
Decades ago, Tim Hiebert was a local hockey star in the Pembina Valley hockey league, and he has parlayed that local celebrity to great success in his new venture.
“We specialize in day old donuts and coffee that’s been sitting on the burner just a touch too long,” said Hiebert. “It’s how all da Mannanites like it.”
Hiebert also offers customers a little treat called ‘Hiebert Holes.’
“It’s the inside of the donut,” said the ever-frugal Hiebert. “They pay me fifty cents yet and I give them  nothing in return. It’s a good joke!”
Costumers were quick to catch on to Hiebert’s shenanigans and are now sticking to more conventional offerings like sour-cream glazed donuts and sandwiches his wife Dorothy makes in their bungalow over by the Bergthaler Church.
“I’m not sure we’ll ever get a real donut shop in this town, but Tim Hieberts will have to do,” said Mr. Vogt. “Plus it’s a great place to catch up on all the local gossip.”
On it’s first day of operation, every table at Tim Hieberts in Gretna was packed with old men sitting around nursing their coffees and “shooting the shit.”

HOFer Gary Bettman was Winnipeg Jets Leading Scorer from 1997-2010,"TORONTO, ON
American hockey phenom Gary Bettman was recently inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Perhaps the most-loved player of his generation, Bettman amassed more points than any other Winnipeg Jets player from 1997 to 2010.
“The man’s puck handling was incredible,” said Bettman fan Peter Plett. “I mean in the late nineties, he clearly outshone any other Jets player.”
Bettman’s career highlights also include leading the Quebec Nordiques in assists for the past twenty years and leading the Minnesota North Stars in goals from 1994-1999.
“Move over Gretzky. The impact this awkward little man from Queens has had on the game of hockey is unrivalled,” said Plett. “I’m not surprised he’s in the Hall of Fame. I think he’ll go down as one of the greatest Hartford Whalers of the last two decades!”
Bettman says he is very proud of his accomplishments and is equally impressed with his bust that was unveiled in a ceremony earlier today.
“My compliments to the sculptor. I think I come across very handsome,” said Bettman. “I would have left off the devil horns myself, but, over all, great work!”
Bettman is also making plans to move the Hockey Hall of Fame from its home in Toronto to some place in Arizona where no one will visit it.

Study Reveals 70% of Mennonites Don’t Know All the Dance Moves to Hymn 606,"HARRISONBURG, VA
A new study out of Southeastern Mennonite University has revealed that a shocking 70% of Mennonites no longer know all the dance moves to Hymn 606.
“It’s a shame,” said Mennonite anthropologist and dance enthusiast Dr. Hurst. “There was a time when every Mennonite child was taught all the dance moves to every hymn in the book, but these days that’s just not a priority. Our culture is being lost…”
Dr. Hurst believes that churches should put more emphasis on dance instruction in Sunday School.
“No one should go through a year of Mennonite Sunday School without solid instruction in dancing to 606 and a few lessons on martyrs,” said Hurst. “Praise God from whom all blessings flow…and shake your booty doing it!”
Traditionalists were horrified by the study and hope to remedy the situation.
“Young people these days don’t know anything about all our Mennonite traditions. Pacifism. Cheese consumption. And dancing the Charleston to 606!” said Mrs. Miller. “What is this world coming to?”
There already is some talk that the new revised Mennonite hymnal will eliminate all the responsive readings, which no one was doing anyway, and replace them with visuals to illustrate and teach all the dance moves.

"“The Last Shall Be First, and the First Shall Be Last”: Sermon Causes Traffic Jam in Mennonite Town","MARTENSVILLE, SK
Vehicles were backed up for blocks in the small Mennonite town of Martensville this week after Pastor Martens gave a particularly stirring sermon on Matthew 20.
“The last shall be first, and the first shall be last,” said Pastor Martens, who compelled his parishioners to apply this lesson to their daily lives.
That Sunday afternoon, Martensville came to stand still as every Martens in town politely waved the other drivers through. The problem was, no one wanted to be first.
“Oba, nay, I’m not going first!” said Mr. Martens. “I’m staying right here. Go ahead, Klaas. You have the right-of-way.”
“Nah, Pieta! You go!” said Klaas. “I’m pretty sure you got to the intersection first.”
As more cars started to arrive and no one seemed to be moving, the police showed up at the scene to sort things out.
“I tried to direct traffic, but no one would enter the intersection,” said Constable Martens. “It was incredibly frustrating.”
Eventually it was agreed upon by all parties that someone would just yell “three-two-one go!” and they would all go at the same time. The results of this suggestion were as expected and more than two hundred vehicles were written off. Thankfully, not a single Martens was injured.

Introducing Every Mennonite’s New Favourite Winter Pastime: Strip Knipsbrat,"SASKATOON, SK
Young married couples in small towns all around the Saskatoon region have grown tired of the same old crokinole games on Saturday nights and have decided to add their own twist known as stripsbrat.
“It was time to spice things up a bit,” said Mrs. Wiebe. “There were only so many times I could play the regular knipsbrat without losing interest. This new strip version really makes it interesting!”
Wiebe says her husband Earl has shown a dramatic increase in his knipsing skills ever since this new version was introduced.
“He’s hitting tens and fifteens like I’ve never seen it before,” said Wiebe. “And you should see what happens when he nails a twenty!”
Wiebe says stripsbrat is very easy to play, though she warns couples to makes sure to account for all knipsers at the end of each match.
“I’m not sure where they’re going,” says Wiebe, “but every time we play we seem to lose a few knipsers.”",NaN,"November 9, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_3132-e1536545492162.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Rosenort Couple Faces Existential Crisis: Are We Jantsied or Ditsied?,"ROSENORT, MB
The Loewens of Rosenort have been facing considerable anxiety over the last few years trying to figure out whether they’re Jantsied or Ditsied. The conundrum has caused such stress that the Loewens have entered marital counselling just to address this issue.
“Okay, so, like Dave says Rosenort is on the west side of the Red River, so that makes it Jantsied,” said Alice. “Plus, our accent is totally Jantsied, he says.”
However, Alice isn’t convinced by Dave’s arguments.
“The man knows nothing about history. The Scratching River settlement was a third reserve, neither East nor West and it was primarily settled by people from the East Reserve. That would make us Ditsieders!”
Alice also points out the fact they do all their shopping in Steinbach and even drive out to Southland for church on Sundays.
“We’re Ditsieders through and through!” says Alice. “And I sure hope our marriage counsellor can convince Dave of this!”
Dave begrudgingly agreed to go to counselling so long as they can stop by at Morris Chicken Chef on the way home to Rosenort.",NaN,"November 8, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/couple-e1541641375599.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake

Thrift Store Prices Still Not Cheap Enough for Mennonite Thieves,"WINNIPEG, MB
Soaring prices at local thrift stores have forced some unscrupulous Mennonites into shoplifting in order to obtain the rubber boots and crocheted doilies needed for bare survival.
“When I saw the prices, I had no other choice,” said Peter, a local thief. “When they charge two dollars for a pair of Lee overalls, they’re basically asking us to steal it.”
Some Mennonites have also taken to rummaging through the donation bin before the items even get into the store.
“Woah, look at this mattress,” said Peter. “A bag full of baby’s clothes! Oh, look, a Justin Bieber jigsaw puzzle. I can’t believe people are donating all this awesome stuff to me.”
Peter claims he’ll be the best dressed man in church on Sunday, thanks to all the awesome new items he obtained from the thrift store.

Caravan of Mennonites Heading for U.S. Border,"ABBOTSFORD, BC
The Driedger family of Abbotsford have loaded up their Dodge Caravan and are currently heading for the U.S. border. Authorities are on high alert, having been notified not to let any caravans enter the country.
“We’re just going down to Seattle to pick up a few things at the Hobby Lobby,” said Mrs. Driedger. “So we loaded up Maria, Adam, Sally, Greg, Tim, little Menno, and even Oma into the Caravan and away we went.”
The Driedger Caravan is full of Mennonites eager to get into the United States and the American government is taking the situation very seriously.
“We’ve heard something of these Mennonite caravans and we’re not going to let another one through,” said Officer Smucker. “I have been assured that we have the full support of the American military power in preventing another caravan from getting into the country.”
The Driedgers were planning to come back after just a couple days of shopping and dining at their favourite American chains, but the border officers are not buying their story.
“They all say they’re going to grab a bite to eat and then go right back home,” said Smucker. “But I don’t trust them at all. I mean, seriously, who really wants to eat at TGI Friday’s?”
The Mennonite Caravan is scheduled to reach the border later this evening, just in time to make the headlines right before the midterms.

Zwieback Added to Periodic Table of Elements,"ZURICH, SWITZERLAND
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has decided they’ve given up on mercury and decided to replace element 80 with the dry Mennonite bread known has zwieback.
“It’s one of the foundational elements in all of chemistry,” said Dr. Hershberger. “Without zwieback, the entire molecular structure of the universe falls apart. I’m really shocked it wasn’t added to the periodic table sooner.”
Science teachers in Mennonite country were excited for the chance to finally make their subject relevant to the students.
“Mennonites have been….how should I say it?….rather skeptical of science,” said Mr. Hershberger. “But now that we’ve got zwieback on the periodic table, I think we’ll see a huge surge in interest in the natural sciences.”
Rejected Mercury was sad to be shunned and replaced with zwieback, but was able to find a new church community in which to fellowship.
“I’m going to check out the Lutherans,” said Mercury. “If the Mennonites won’t have me, I know they will.”

Mennonite Woman Accused of Wearing Makeup After Lipstick is Found on Husband’s Collar,"NEUANLAGE, SK
Mrs. Neustadter of Neuanlage was hauled in by the church board this week after a bright red streak of lipstick was discovered on her husband’s collar.
“I can’t believe that Mrs. Neustadter would defile herself with makeup,” said Elder Friesen. “Oba, the women in this town sure could use a lesson in modesty!”
Although Mrs. Neustadter denied ever wearing any lipstick, the elders met well into the evening on Sunday trying to figure out the appropriate punishment for such an obvious violation.
“The worst thing about this is that she’s denying it,” exclaimed Mr. Friesen. “But the evidence is clear! I mean, how else did the lipstick get there?”
Despite harsh criticism of Mrs. Neustadter and her debauchery, the town has rallied around Mr. Neustadter who, apparently, had no idea there was lipstick on his collar.
“The man is a hero,” said Mr. Friesen. “He’s been through so much over the years…and now this! It’s really so sad.”

Caf-Lib a Top Seller at Hip New Mennonite Coffee Shop,"REICHENBACH, MB
Villagers in a small Mennonite town have been flocking to a new hip coffee shop called Oma’s Java Barn to get their hands on a cup of Oma’s delicious coffee substitute.
“They can’t get enough of this Caf-Lib,” said Oma. “Some of the MBs prefer Postum, but all the Kleine Gemeinde really go for Caf-Lib.”
Oma says only the hippest seniors patronize her store and some are willing to pay up to fifty cents a cup for a spoonful of ground chicory and a cup of hot water.
“Oba, yo! Sometimes they ask for a double-double, so I just throw in another teaspoon of Caf-Lib and a couple non-dairy creamers and call it a day,” said Oma. “I’ll even write Nettie or Heinrich on the cup if they ask for it.”
It is believed that Caf-Lib’s popularity among Mennonites stems from Elder Petkau’s 1893 proclamation against drug usage, which included the use of caffeine…either that or the seniors wanted to make sure they were well-rested so they could get up in time for the German service.",NaN,"November 2, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/caflib-e1541125457147.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake

Local man Dick Brandt underwent emergency dental surgery this week after cracking four molars and an incisor on Oma Brandt’s notorious rock hard päpanät.
“Diewel, Oma’s päpanät are hard yet,” exclaimed Mr. Brandt, spewing bits of teeth and cookies across the room. “Jauma Lied, oma! Be a little gentler next time!”
The search was on to find Mr. Brandt’s teeth. Eventually the debris was discovered next to the record player and a collection of Barry Moore albums.
“It doesn’t look like we’ll be able to reuse them,” said a local dentist. “The odds of surviving a päpanät attack like this are very slim.”
As for Mr. Brandt, he is now undergoing surgery to restore his handsome smile.
“Next time I’m sticking to pfeffernusse,” said Mr. Brandt, apparently unaware that it was exactly the same thing. “I’ve never lost a tooth on one of those.”

Old Colony Mennonites Confused for Trick-or-Treaters,"WINKLER, MB
A group of Old Colony Mennonites were walking around Winkler today and, for some strange reason, people kept handing them Halloween candy.
“One lady complemented me on my costume,” said Corny Wall, visiting from Taber. “And I was like ‘what costume, yet?'”
Apparently the conservative attire of the Mennonites was confused for Halloween gear.
“I thought they were dressed up as pioneers or something,” said Mrs. Berg. “I really had no idea. I assumed they wanted candy.”
Corny Wall said he’s not offended by the confusion.
“This is the first time these suspenders have ever got me a bag full of Reese Peanut Butter Cups,” said Corny. “It was a pretty good haul.”
Corny said his cousins Maria and Anna managed to acquire enough treat size Oh Henry’s to last a lifetime.
“Everyone thought I was dressed as Laura Ingalls Wilder,” explained Maria. “What’s wrong with these Winkler people? They truly have lost touch with their Mennonite roots.”

Parademics had to be called to the local Kleine Gemeinde church this past week after grade 2 Sunday School teacher Annie Friesen, 76, became stuck to the flannelgraph board.
“We get flannelgraph-related calls once in a while in Aylmer,” said Sgt. Driedger, “but this was quite a unique situation. Mrs. Friesen was stuck to that thing like glue.”
After a three-hour procedure, medical personnel extracted Mrs. Friesen, and her wool sweater, from the flannegraph board, along with a number of flannelgraph camels, three flannelgraph disciples, and a few Old Testament prophets.
“Mrs. Friesen is recovering, but it was touch and go there for a while,” said Driedger. “She was only fifteen minutes into her lesson at the time of the incident. Any longer and she might have been permanently stuck to that thing.”
Friesen hopes to make a full recovery and plans to be back telling flannelgraph stories later this fall.

Days after being fired from his job on the long-running sitcom The Simpsons, Apu Nahasaspeemapetilton has been hired by Fox News to work as a political pundit.
“We only hire cartoon characters around here,” said Fox News. “Plus we’re not nearly as concerned about cultural appropriation as the main Fox network obviously is.”
Apu, who has worked for almost thirty years at a Springfield-area convenience store will add a voice of reason to the otherwise insipid and ill-informed commentary on the network.
“As a cartoon character, he’s the realest, most sincere person we’ve got on this network,” said the spokesperson. “We considered Groundskeeper Willie for a while, but it was decided he was too calm and even-keeled for our network.”

Italian Canadians Object to Trudeau’s New Carbonara Tax,"TORONTO, ON
There is growing opposition in Canada’s Italian population to the Trudeau government’s proposed ‘Carbonara Tax.’ According to experts, the new tax, will affect millions of Italians and lovers of Italian food across the country.
“A carbonara tax! How dare he!” shouted Mr. Esposito. “The cost of carbonara is already high enough without adding on some stupid tax!”
Guests at a local Olive Garden were equally perturbed by the tax.
“Nah, oba! What’s next, a tax on waffle sauce,” commented Mr. Friesen, who comes to the Waterloo Olive Garden every weekend with his wife Dorothy. “I don’t see any evidence that carbonara is polluting up the atmosphere.”
Despite the protests, the Prime Minister insists that a carbonara tax is the only thing that can save us from impending environmental disaster.
“The Little Italys of this country are churning out so much carbonara that something has to be done!” said Trudeau. “Either we tax carbonara, or we start driving electric cars – the choice is yours!”
Never wanting to jeopardize his popularity in the province of Quebec, Trudeau announced a huge incentive package for those willing to switch from carbonara to poutine gravy.

In an effort to reduce lineups and assist the voting process, a local group is petitioning Steinbach to include each candidate’s church affiliation on all future ballots.
“It’s the most important information there is,” said local resident Mr. Berg. “What else do I need to know? Who’s your daddy and what church do you attend?”
Founded by the Kleine Gemeinde, Steinbach has experienced dozens of schisms and revivals over the years, resulting in dozens of churches that, with rare exception, all basically believe the exact same thing.

According to leading fact-checking website Snopes.com, a sermon by our very own Pastor Dave has been found to be “FALSE.”
“In his Oct. 21 sermon, three of Pastor Dave’s sermon illustrations were discovered to have been completely made-up, while his exegesis on the Book of Isaiah was iffy at best.”
This isn’t the first time Pastor Dave’s scriptural interpretation has been brought into questioning.

Steinbachers ‘Super Excited’ to Finally Have Some Sort of Prohibition Once Again,"STEINBACH, MB
After decades of being the only community in Manitoba to ban alcohol sales, Steinbach has felt a little out-of-sorts since the first liquor store opened in 2009. So, this October, as Canada legalized cannabis sales, Steinbach voters jumped at the opportunity to finally prohibit something again.
“In a town where everything is closed at 9 o’clock, plebiscites are all we have to keep things interesting,” said Mr. Unrau. “I don’t have strong feelings one way or the other about cannabis sales, but I’m just glad that once again we’ll be able to distinguish ourselves from all the other towns around here. Banning stuff is what makes Steinbach great!”
Local man Mr. Friesen said he hopes the Canadian government keeps on relaxing the laws.
“The more stuff the Liberals legalize, the more stuff we can vote to ban,” said Mr. Friesen. “Without referendums and quilt auctions I really wouldn’t have any reason to get up in the morning.”
Steinbachers are looking forward to cannabis referendums every five years for the next fifty years until residents plan to change their minds and vote for legalization in the year 2068.

It seems that Steinbach has taken a cue from it’s larger neighbour to the north and has decided to barricade Main and Brandt and force pedestrians to cross the intersection through poorly-lit pathways deep below the surface.
“Oba, this barrier is so much better yet,” said Mrs. Friesen. “It’ll keep people far away from the 7-11 and also prevent people from getting too close to Miriam Toews’ childhood home.”
Not everyone in Steinbach was impressed with the new underground walkway, however.
“Maybe they can put the new cannibas store down there or something – that way no one will see you,” said Mr. Plett. “But, as for me, I prefer to spend as much time above ground as the good Lord allows.”

The Brandt kids were settling in for a nice lunch with Grandma and Grandpa, when things got a little awkward. Grandma came into the house and presented the children with a lovely array of freshly picked rhubarb from the garden. Grandpa, being eager, selected a particularly sour looking stalk and chomped down on it.

But it was happening! Grandpa Brandt continued to chomp down on poor Petunia and couldn’t figure out why the heck the children were all so distraught.
“And just who is Petunia Rhubarb?” Grandpa asked.
Apparently, Petunia Rhubarb was Larry the Cucumber’s girlfriend and Grandpa Brandt had just devoured her.
“I ain’t never letting these kids watch Veggie Tales again,” said Grandpa Brandt. “Not if it means I have to give up my rhubarb habit.”
Petunia Rhubarb, or what’s left of her, was rushed to the clinic in Altona where she is undergoing emergency surgery in hope of restoring her to health and eventually replanting her in Grandma Brandt’s garden.

A new spin-off of the popular TV show ‘Cash Cab’ offers conservative Mennonites and Amish the chance to answer a few trivia questions and win a bit of money on their way to church. The new show, called ‘Cash Buggy’, surprised their first riders, the Snider family just outside St. Jacobs this week.
“For a chance to win $25,” asked the driver, while pulling on the reins. “In what year did Conrad Grebel baptize George Blaurock?”
Mr. Snider appeared puzzled by the question, shook his head, then removed his black-rimmed hat to wipe the sweat from his brow.
“If we don’t get this one,” he said to Mrs. Snider. “I don’t think they’ll let us into the church.”
Thankfully Mrs. Snider knew the answer: “1525,” she said.
The Sniders were peppered with other questions such as, “What was Menno Simons’ wife’s name?” and “In what year was the infamous Groffdale-Weaverland schism?” They even had to stop by the side of the road to ask a passerby for help.
“That man was no help at all. Just an Englisher who wanted to take our picture,” said Mrs. Snider. “Well, anyway, I’m glad we made it up to the $325 question.”

“I told you so,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, looking considerably less handsome than usual with his blood-shot eyes. “It’s remarkable! You’re crippled with debt one day and the next it’s all vanished into thin air. It’s just one more thing that makes Canada the great country that it is!”
Millions of Canadians potheads lined up outside their local marijuana shops to legally purchase weed and pay their taxes for the first time.
“It’s like the 60s all over again! But this time the government likes us!” said one Ottawa man, who purchased three hash brownies and a half dozen joints. “Who would have thought getting stoned would have such a beneficial impact on the Canadian economy! This is better than the oil sands!”
The Canadian government was quick to report the financial benefits of the new legislation.
“We were down to $300 billion by ten in the morning,” said Minister of Finance Bill Morneau. “Sales were steady all day and by early evening our decade’s old debt was completely gone. Thanks, cannabis!”
The debt reduction strategy has been praised by pundits as a miracle of economics, although a few suspect the Finance Minister was high when he made the calculations.

Canadian Mennonites Lineup to Get Their Hands on Legal Platz,"SOUTH BLUMENORT, MB
Ten of thousands of Mennonites across Canada have been lining up outside platz shops today to get their hands on legal platz for the first time in nearly 100 years.
“It’s a great day for all us Mennos,” said Mr. Wiebe. “I just hope they don’t run out of the blueberry strain before I get to the front of the line.”
For nearly a century, Mennonites have been secretly baking platz in their own homes.
“I’ve been growing my own rhubarb for decades,” said Mrs. Klassen. “It’ll be nice to be able to just stop by the neighbourhood store and pick some up.”
The demand was so high that some shops ran out of platz by noon, and critics are hoping this is not a sign of times to come.
“If the legal platz shops can’t keep up with demand, we’ll keep having to rely on Mrs. Friesen,” said Mr. Wiebe. “And no one wants to do that. I mean, the whole point of platz legalization was to put people like Mrs. Friesen out of business.”
In Ontario, platz is only available for purchase online, but the rest of the country has much easier access.
“I love the new law,” said Mr. Wiebe. “I just hope they do the same thing with yerba and zoat.”

Mennonite Man Naps Right Through Faspa,"NEW BOTHWELL, MB
Local man, Lyle Braun, 37, was so tuckered out after a long week at work that he slept right through faspa on Sunday. By the time he woke up his wife Anne was already packing up the kids and ready to leave Oma’s house.
“Oba, nay! Someone should have woken me up for faspa yet!” said a distraught and slightly disoriented Mr. Braun. “That’s the last time I aver lie down on the Chesterfield at Oma Braun’s house!”
Lyle is not the first Mennonite man to meddachschlop right through faspa, as the Brauns have a history of this.
“It runs in the family. Opa Braun used to meddachschlop through faspa and all the way through the evening service, too, yet,” explained Oma Braun. “I just let them sleep. More pickles and rolled up slices of processed ham for the rest of us!”
Lyle is planning to set an alarm on his phone the next time he lays down for a couple winks on the couch.

Mennonite Man Has Suspenders Confiscated at Quebec Border,"GATINEAU, QC
Johan Brubacher hitched up the wagon this week, eager to take his family to Montreal, a city renowned for Mennonite specialties like poutine and craft beer. However, as soon as the buggy crossed the Ottawa River he was accosted by the Sûreté du Québec, who immediately tore the suspenders off his back.
“There I was in Gatineau and I couldn’t even keep my pants on,” said Brubacher. “They said suspenders are a religious symbol and could not be worn in Quebec.”
Thanks to Quebec’s new secularist laws, Mr. Brubacher was hauled into the nearest police station and interrogated for hours with absolutely nothing to hold his pants up.
“They seized three Bibles and Anna’s copy of Martyrs Mirror,” said Brubacher. “I told them it was pretty ironic to be confiscating a book about martyrs, but they just laughed and said ‘rules are rules.'”
Under the new Quebec law all suspenders in the province will be confiscated and burned in a public square dedicated to the gods of “modern Quebec values” such as nihilism, intolerance, and bigotry.

Mennonite Family to Survive on Last Sunday’s Leftovers for the Next Two Years,"FORT VERMILLION, AB
There was so much food leftover at the Reimer family potluck last Sunday that the entire clan had enough food to last for the next two years.
“We were told to bring a dozen buns and a dish to share,” said Mrs. B. Reimer. “But you know, I didn’t want to look chintzy, so I made a pork roast, three casseroles and five blueberry pies and brought them along, too.”
But Mrs. B. Reimer wasn’t the only one to bring way too much friggin’ food. Her sisters Dorothy and Anne were also in on the action.
“I signed up to bring a ring of farmer sausage, but I figured I’d butcher a whole hog and bring that,” said Anne. “Plus a few ice cream pails full of carrot/pea mix.”
In the end the Reimers were left with enough food to feed five thousand Reimers for one day or a couple dozen Reimers for two years.
“It’s a miracle,” said Mrs. Reimer. “It happens at every Reimer gathering!”

Mennonite Rapper Corny Reimer Officially Endorses Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON, DC
Eager to have as much credibility in the rap community as he can, US President Donald Trump has sought out the endorsements of many high profile rap artists, such as Kanye West, and, ummm, now Menno hip hop legend Corny Reimer.
“Nah, Mister Trump invited me and my fru to da White House and gave us all red hats and sausage and said I should tell some rhymes,” said Corny Reimer. “So, dan, I thought, well okay dan, and I so I said some of my rhymes yet.”
With his wife Anita beat boxing along at his side, Corny spit some mad rhymes about milking cows, threshing wheat and being baptized upon confession of your faith.
“Now that I’ve got Kanye and Corny on my side I can’t lose,” said Trump. “This endorsement is a real boost. Just tremendous.”
Trump was so impressed with the young Anabaptist music star that he plans to make Corny Reimer the Minister of Arts and Culture.
“Either that or the Ambassador to Belize,” said Trump. “He can have his pick.”
Corny Reimer has already been given a spot on Kanye West’s new tour, and the two are working on a new mash-up of West’s ‘The College Dropout’ album entitled ‘The Sunday School Dropout.’",NaN,"October 13, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tractor-e1539473134278.jpg?resize=630%2C354,Fake

Local Grocery Store Opens New ‘Mennonite Aisle’,"LYNDHURST, VA
Desperate to capitalize on the growing Mennonite market, the local Thrift-and-Save Grocery Barn has decided to open up an aisle dedicated to things that Mennonites tend to purchase such as sausage, German Bibles, hymn books, and fake wine.
“Finally a one-stop aisle dedicated to us Mennonites,” said Johan Showalter of the small Mennonite town of Lyndhurst. “It’s never been more convenient to buy hymn books and sausages in the same place!”
Local Mennonites are excited about not having to go all the way across the store to get their supplies.
“It’s about time someone put the German Bibles next to the near beer,” said Showalter. “They go together like two peas in a pod.”
The aisle also features jars of blackstrap molasses and hardcover copies of Martyrs Mirror.
“Plus they named it Aisle 606,” said Showalter. “With a name like that, I’ll have no trouble remembering where to go!”
The aisle attracted considerable attention from the 65+ crowd, but all the young Mennos were still crowding the Pepsi and Doritos aisle like usual.

Mennonite Hockey Fans Yell ‘True North’ During Hymn Sing,"WINNIPEG, MB
As the Winnipeg Jets played their home opener last night, Mennonite hockey fans across the province are excited for the upcoming season. Some were so excited that they spontaneously yelled “True North” in the middle of a hymn sing at church.
“First they yelled it during the second verse of ‘Count Your Many Blessings’ and that was bad enough, but then a whole bunch of young people in men’s section ripped their shirts off and yelled “Truth North” during 606!” recounted Mrs. Wiebe. “It was downright shameful….but, anyway, Go Jets Go!”
After a disappointing exit in the Western Conference finals last year, fans are hoping the Jets can go all the way this year.
“Yelling “True North” during the anthem ain’t enough,” said Peter Wall. “I figure if we yell it during every song we ever sing, it’ll increase our chances of a cup this year.”
Pastor Jim was not particularly impressed with the ruckus, but decided it was best just to go with the flow.
“It’s not the worst thing that’s been yelled from the pews during one of my services,” said Jim. “Usually someone’s accusing me of heresy or something.”
In other news, the Sunday School children are being encouraged to see who can memorize the names and numbers of the entire Jets roster and earn their way to Bible camp next summer.

Shocking Details Revealed in Margins of Mennonite Woman’s Cookbook,"BOW ISLAND, AB
Mrs. Kehler had the great misfortune of leaving her Mennonite Treasury Cookbook sitting out on the counter when she lay down for a nice afternoon nap this past Sunday. Soon photos of her cookbook and the juicy details in the margins, were floating around Facebook.
“Nah, so she doesn’t think too highly of the Mrs. Brandt’s summa borscht on page 18, eh?” said Mrs. Klassen.” That figures. Mrs. Kehler never had the stamina to make a good summa borscht.”
There was also considerable discussion on Facebook about the various plumi moos recipes on page 21.
“Wow, so Mrs. Brandt seems to have tried them all. It seems her Abe prefers the Olfert recipe,” said Mrs. Klassen. “Well, my Abe likes the Warkentin version better!”
Mrs. Kehler woke up an hour later and found all her precious margin notes splashed all over Facebook. It was the greatest scandal the small Mennonite town of Bow Island, Alberta had ever seen.
“And Instagram, too, yet! Oba nay!” said Mrs. Kehler. “Well, I’ve learned my lesson. You never leave your cookbook lying around. It’s like leaving open your diary.”

Mennonite Woman Confuses Genealogy Website for Dating App,"NEW BOTHWELL, MB
Aghast at the prices of more famous ancestry websites, local woman Amy Penner decided to subscribe to Grandma’s Window, a much more affordable website dedicated exclusively to Russian Mennonite genealogy. The problem was, however, that as soon as Amy subscribed, she soon became more interested in discovering who was single than who her ancestors were.
“Oh, look, Adam Penner is just a year older than me and he just lives over there in Blumenhoff,” said Penner. “Oh, and check out Derrick Penner’s profile! 25 years old, a Steinbach Bible College graduate, and owns five-hundred acres near Grunthal!”
Penner spent hours scouring the website and compiling a list of cousins she could date.
“I have more cousins than I even realized,” said Penner. “And many of them are single!”
With the decline in family gatherings as of late, Penner claims the genealogy website is one of the few places left for a young woman like her to find an eligible bachelor.
“Colin Penner, 1989-present, seems like a catch,” says Penner. “Best of all, he’s my second cousin!”

"Henderson, Nebraska Officially Declared “The Middle of Nowhere”","HENDERSON, NE
After exploring small isolated towns across the globe, the United Nations has officially declared a small Mennonite town in eastern Nebraska as “the Middle of Nowhere.” Henderson, Nebraska, population 991, beat out Dalmeny, Saskatchewan and Shipyard, Belize for the prestigious title. More than a few darps in Manitoba were also in the running.
“We’re absolutely thrilled to get this kind of recognition,” said honourary town mayor Petey Friesen via telegraph. “Last year we got our first colour TV and now this! Really exciting!”
The citizens of Henderson plan to celebrate being the middle of nowhere by all going to the middle of somewhere together.
“Oba, if the buggies can make it all the way to Kearney or Central City, I’ll be very impressed,” said Friesen, “though a stop in McCool Junction will be good enough, I suppose. At least it’s somewhere and not nowhere.”
Residents of Dalmeny and Shipyard were understandably disappointed in the results.
“All my years I’ve been slaving away here in the canola fields of Dalmeny completely unaware of the outside world,” said one Dalmeny farmer. “To think it was all for nothing!”
Mennonites in Shipyard plan to “try a lot harder” over the next year in hopes that they can take the crown from Henderson.
“We’re planning to up and move the whole community a bit further away from the capital city,” said Mr. Jansen. “500 miles should do it.”
For now Henderson is basking in its moment of glory, although they will have to celebrate alone, however, as everyone felt Henderson was “just too far out” of their way.

Mennonite Man Tinkers with Grandma Penner’s Recipes,"HOCHFELD, MB
For the past three years, local bachelor Darryl Penner, 41, has been attempting to improve his grandmother’s beloved Mennonite recipes and, just this past weekend, he finally decided to reveal his improved versions to the world.
“I’ve got a new and improved schmaunt fat, waffle sauce and green bean soup,” said Penner. “Just wait until you try them. You’ll never eat your grandma’s cooking again!”
Penner admits his main strategy is to just double the amount of sugar and/or vinegar, “depending on the recipe,” but claims his new recipes are quite the innovation.
“You’d be amazed how much better the waffle sauce is with a bit more vanilla and a lot more sugar!” said Penner. “This stuff makes children’s breakfast cereal seem bland.”
So far the public have not been impressed with his altered versions.
“It’s heretical. It’s blasphemy,” said Mrs. Wiebe. “There are only two rules for Mennonites: shoot over your enemy’s head and never mess with Grandma Penner!”
Darryl is hoping his new recipes will attract a woman his age, but so far, for poor lonely Darryl, they haven’t been all that impressed either.

Mennonite Child’s Macaroni Art Purchased by the Louvre,"PARIS, FRANCE
For the first time in its long history, the world’s most prestigious art museum will include Mennonite macaroni art as part of its collection. Starting this fall little Jessica Berg’s ‘Self-portrait in Macaroni and Rice’ will be displayed alongside such masterworks as the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo.
“We’re very excited to make this acquisition of macaroni art,” said Louvre curator Marie Dubois. “Berg is a master of negative space and texture. She uses Elmer’s glue to create a profound commentary on contemporary life!”
Pastor Dan Wiebe of South Blumenort Gospel Mennonite Bible Fellowship says this purchase was a long time coming.
“Mennonites have a long tradition of making art with macaroni and it’s nice to see this tradition finally getting some international recognition,” said Pastor Dan. “This is exactly the reason why we set aside between $40 and $60 every year to provide the Sunday School kids with macaroni and non-toxic white glue. I’m glad to see that investment is finally paying off!”
Young Jessica was excited to hear her art had received such attention overseas and says she already has a few ideas for future projects.
“Our teacher, Ms. Klassen, said next week we’re cutting out pieces of old jeans and t-shirts to decorate a Raggedy Anne picture,” said Jessica, who wasn’t sure what the Bible lesson was. “She’s even letting us use the grownup markers!”

Coming this October to a Mennonite Church Near You: Pumpkin Spice Baptisms!,"FRESNO, CA
Desperate to capture the lucrative 25-40 market, the First Mennonite Brethren Church of Fresno has decided that all baptisms during the month of October will be conducted with Mrs. Jansen’s famous pumpkin spice mixture.
“This’ll really draw the crowds,” said Pastor Johan. “People go nuts for pumpkin spice this time of year.”
The baptismal tank will be filled with 70/30 split of pumpkin spice to regular water and baptismal candidates will be allowed five minutes to drink as much as they please of the lukewarm holiday treat.
“There have always been a few attendees that were a little wishy-washy when it came to taking the step of baptism,” said the pastor. “I’m hoping pumpkin spice will convince them to take the plunge.”
Whatever water that is leftover after young Billy, Sarah, Thomas, and Ashley have been dunked, will be served at faspa to an eager audience of Mennonites.

NAFTA is  No More: Leaders Sign Historic MCUSA Trade Agreement,"WASHINGTON, DC
The leaders of USA, Mexico, and Canada have renegotiated NAFTA this week and given the accord a new name, the Mexico-Canada-United-States-Agreement or MCUSA for short. The new name created some confusion as the abbreviation is also used by Mennonite Church USA.
“I mean we’re more about fair trade than free trade,” said a Mennonite Church spokesperson. “We also like to make decisions during arduous committee meetings rather than personal attacks via Twitter, but to each his own.”
Mennonites across North America were initially very excited that they’d finally be able to trade pie recipes freely with one another, but their excitement soon waned when they found out it was just another NAFTA deal.
“You’d think with a name like that there’d be a least something in it for us Mennonites,” said Mrs. Buchholder. “I really don’t think Trump’s as good a negotiator as he thinks he is.”
The new NAFTA accord has been criticized by Canadian dairy farmers who feel they’re going to suffer under the new deal.

Paul McCartney Shows Up at Mennonite Wedding,"BLUMENHOF, MB
The Wiebe and Dueck families of Blumenhof were excited, and a little baffled, after Sir Paul McCartney cycled onto the property this weekend.
“There we were chowing down on Mrs. Wiebe’s dills to celebrate our wedding, when one of the Beatles showed up,” said new bride Mrs. Dueck. “We would have invited him to stay for faspa, but we didn’t have much in the way of vegetarian options.”
McCartney, who was in town for a concert at the arena, decided he’d spend Saturday cycling around Mennonite country.
“I heard most of these folks come from Back in the USSR, so I had to check it out,” said McCartney. “All I could think of was, ‘Oba, look at all the lonely people. Where do they all come from?'”
McCartney offered to play a few tunes, but the Mennonites turned down the offer, fearing that he might not know the words to “Church in the Wildwood.”

"Mennonite Woman Calls Wrong Number, Doesn’t Notice for More than Forty Minutes","MEADOW LAKE, SK
Earlier this week, Mrs. Susie Berg, 71, attempted to call her friend Mrs. Helen Reimer to catch up on all the latest gossip. She dialed the number and instantly launched into the rather one-sided conversation.
“Helen, have you heard the latest?” said Mrs. Berg to the woman on the other end of the line. “Do you know about Mrs. Klassen’s quilt? Well, Mrs. Wiebe says that Mrs. Klassen’s quilt are greatly declining in quality and the elders are have even asked Mrs. Peters to take over the kindergarten Sunday School class next year.

Breaking News! No Abes Running for Steinbach City Council this Term!,"STEINBACH, MB
It’s the most shocking revelation of the 2018 campaign season: for the first time in Steinbach history, the list of city council candidates is completely Abe-less. Instead the list of candidates includes an Alan, Michael, Jac, Susan, Damian, Mitesh, Jake, Bill, Cyndy and Adam.
“This is outrageous,” said head of the local Abe-ist society Mr. Unrau. “I’ve been voting for Abes since the 60s and now there isn’t a single one to represent the needs and values of Steinbach area Abes!”
Things didn’t get any better in the mayoral race, however, as there wasn’t an Abe to be found on that list either.
“Who’s running for mayor? John, Paul, and Earl? Sounds like three-quarters of the Beatles to me,” said Unrau. “Come on now! If they aren’t going to give us an Abe, they should at least have a couple Barkmans on the list.”
Unrau says he really doesn’t know who he’ll vote for this year, but plans to bring along a bunch of Abes and sit in the front row at the candidate’s forum next week.
“For decades I’ve just been scanning the list and putting my X next to any Abe I see,” said Unrau. “I guess for the first time in my life I’ll have to really pay attention to their platforms and policies and stuff and vote based on that.”

Local man Peter Sawatzky, 72, is being hailed as a hero in Winkler this week after successfully driving all the way to the Costco on McGillvray with his right turn signal on.

A commemorative cairn featuring Sawatzky’s achievement has already been unveiled just in front of Southland Mall. Sawatzky hopes his remarkable turn signal stamina will set an example for others.
“Whether young or old, everyone is Winkler is capable of driving around oblivious to the fact their turn signal is still on,” said Sawatzky. “Believe me, if I can do it, then so can you!”
New Winkler drivers will be trained in the art of leaving your turn signal on at Driver’s Ed class this fall.

Tim Allen to Star in New Show ‘Last Mennonite Standing’,"HOLLYWOOD, CA
After the on-again off-again relationship with broadcaster ABC, Tim Allen, born Tim Dick, has decided to take his talents elsewhere with a new sitcom called “Last Mennonite Standing.” In the new show Allen plays a conservative Mennonite man named Johan Barkman who runs a chicken eviscerating plant and tries to cope with his liberal children.
“Some say I’m just playing myself again,” said Allen, “but that’s not true. This time I’m doing a killer Low German accent!”
Allen, known for his working class characters throughout his career, is excited to add yet another one to his list.
“It was only a matter of time before I played a Menno. Tool man, sporting goods salesman, Mennonite. I think it works,” said Allen. “I even cast one of my own cousins to play my wife Maria!”
Each episode of the new show involves conflict between the Johan Barkman character and his progressive children who push him to try new things like potato-and-cheddar perogies or chorizo.

Pastor’s Son to Take Over the Family Business,"HOUSTON, TX
After announcing senior pastor Jim’s retirement from full-time ministry this past week, the Big Tex Gospel Church and Smokehouse in Houston has already chosen a successor to lead the church into the future.
“After carefully examining all the resumes and interviewing all the candidates, we felt the Lord leading us to choose Jim’s son Tim,” said Big Tex pastoral search committee chair Andrew. “We really put a lot of thought and prayer into this and for whatever reason Tim just came out on top.”
Tim is considered by many to be a more youthful version of Jim, offering the congregation at Big Tex a fresh perspective on things.
“Jim was much more likely to preach from 1 Chronicles, whereas Tim is more of 2 Chronicles kind of guy,” said Andrew. “Plus, only Tim knows the family BBQ sauce recipe.”
The search committee defended their choice of Tim, despite some questions that the selection process may not have been fair.
“Oh, there will always be doubters out there who say we should have cast our nets further ashore or whatever, but I assure you we tossed them out there and this is what the Lord dragged back in for us,” said Andrew, always a fan of the awkward metaphor. “And even though Tim never got an education or had any experience in church ministry before, we’re confident he was far better qualified then all the seminary-educated people who applied.”
The church had also briefly looked at Jim’s eldest daughter Rachel’s resume, but quickly decided she “just wasn’t right for the job.”",NaN,"September 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pastor-e1519592686837.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Portage and Main to be Accessed Exclusively by Blizzards and Ice Storms,"WINNIPEG, MB
The votes are in and Winnipeg has decided overwhelmingly to restrict access to its most famous intersection to anything other than fierce winds, massive blizzards, devastating ice storms and maybe a tornado or two.
“It’s simply impractical to open it up again to anything else,” said Mr. Penner, “including cars.”
Winnipeggers believe there is something mystical about Portage and Main, which means it can only be accessed by inclement weather patterns.
“First we got rid of the street cars. Then we got rid of the pedestrians. It only make sense that we get rid of all the motorized vehicles and return the corner to elements,” said Penner. “I’m really looking forward to seeing this place in January!”
Penner says there may be a few exceptions for stalled cars and trucks needs a boost, but if your motor’s running you won’t be allowed on Portage and Main.
“Those passageways they’ve got down below are plenty big enough for a Kia or Honda Civic,” said Mr. Penner. “Ultimately we’d like to see a downtown completely free of people altogether.”
Pro-blizzard activists were excited about the results, saying they hope their vision of a pedestrian-free Winnipeg will spread throughout the city.

Mennonite Village Gets Downgraded to Darp Status,"PLAUTFELD, MB
After losing it’s only remaining residents under the age of the sixty, the tiny Mennonite village of Plautfeld has officially been downgraded to darp. According to Manitoba government classifications the term “darp” is reserved for the smallest possible inhabited places just before ceasing to exist completely.
“We’ve got more abandoned buildings here in Plautfeld then we’ve got people,” said Mr. Friesen, who is now the town mayor, trachtmoaka, fix-it-man, and resident missionary. “Once the Platts left for Landmark, the government said we could no longer call ourself a village. We’re just a darp now.”
The government ranks places based on population with the largest being Metropolitan Area. This is followed, in descending order, by city, town, village, hamlet, struck, and then finally darp. With the departure of the Pletts, Plautfield immediately descended to the smallest possible status.
“It’s not all bad,” said Mr. Friesen. “The pressure’s off. Now that we’re no longer a village and just a darp, people don’t expect us to clean the horse shit off the streets or restore the hydro service to the old Klassen barn.”
As a darp, Plautfeld residents will now be permitted to treat all visitors with the greatest level of suspicion.
“Villagers have to, you know, smile and be friendly and welcome guests,” said Mr. Friesen. “But darpers are allowed to stop random vehicles on the road, peer into the window and say, ‘Nah, oba, waut es mit die!'”
Plautfelders will also now be permitted to dry their crops on the road and leave their combines parked just outside the old ice rink.",NaN,"September 25, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/town.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
It’s Official: Steinbach Now Has More Churches than People,"STEINBACH, MB
While population figures have shown considerable growth in Steinbach over the past 5 years, locals were relieved to know that the city still has the highest church to people ratio in the country. With one church for every 3.2 people, Steinbach is definitely the most churched city in the country.
“I’m glad to see that even though our town is growing, the number of churches has also grown,” said local city councillor Dwight Braun. “We see them popping up everywhere these days. We’ve almost got more churches than we have Tim Hortons locations.”
More churches means more options for church-shoppers. In this regard, Steinbach has the greatest selection in Canada, though 80% of the churches are some variation of Mennonite.
“We’ve love to see the Anglican, Unitarian or Orthodox Church come to town,” said Braun. “Maybe even the Quakers. Give the Mennonites a run for their peace-loving money.”
In response to the new census, a interfaith church-planting committee has been formed with the hope of bringing the ratio close to 2:1 by the next census.
“I don’t care if it’s done through church planting or church splitting, but we’ve gotta get that number down,” said Braun. “I’ve heard Winkler is catching up.”

Missing Knipser Finally Found,"REINLAND, MB
The Bergmanns of Reinland had been unable to play a proper game of knipsbrat (or knipsdesh as they call it in their Jantsied dialect) since a gathering this summer, because they did not have a full complement of knipsers.
“We’ve been one short since the Bergmann tournament back in July,” said Mr. Bergmann. “We searched all over for it. Under the Chesterfield pillows, in the golden syrup cupboard, everywhere!”
They even waited a full twenty-four hours and checked the dog run in the backyard just in case Rufus had inadvertently swallowed it.
“Nope. It wasn’t there either,” said Bergmann. “That missing knipser was really keeping me up at night.”
Thankfully, however, the Bergmann knipsbrat/knipsdesh tournaments can finally resume in time for Thanksgiving after the missing knipser was located in the Tante Lina’s “intimates” drawer.
“We’re not even going to ask how it got in there,” said Mr. Bergmann. “Some things are better left a mystery.”

Christian Movie Shatters Box Office Record in Steinbach,"STEINBACH, MB
God’s Not Dead 5: He Still Isn’t Dead stars 47-year-old Kirk Cameron as a freshman college student who, with one impassioned speech, convinces his grumpy professor and his entire class that the world is “no older than six thousand years.” The film flopped everywhere else in the world, but raked in $300 million during a marathon of around-the-clock screenings in church basements across Steinbach this week.
“I guess Kirk Cameron just isn’t as bankable as he used to be,” said the film’s producer. “Thank goodness we’ve got Steinbach or we’d have lost a lot of money on this thing.”
Steinbachers lined the sidewalks, while the film was screened at every single church in town.
“We haven’t seen this kind of reaction since we showed A Man Called Norman back in ’88,” said one local pastor. “Oba, we nearly ran out of popcorn tonight.”
The success of the film has local pastors eager to bring in other Christian films such as the 1970s classics A Thief in the Night and The Cross and the Switchblade.
“We’re also going to play And When They Shall Ask in 3-D,” said Pastor Bob. “It’ll be a double-bill with Menno’s Reins!”

‘Eaton’s Emm Kjalla’ to Re-open Under Bell MTS Place,"WINNIPEG, MB
Mennonites across southern Manitoba were saddling up their horses in anticipation of the grand opening of the new bargain basement below the current hockey arena. The new ‘Eaton’s Emm Kjalla’ marks a triumphant return of cheap stuff to downtown Winnipeg.
“Oba, it’s been years since I shopped at Eaton’s in the basement,” said Mrs. Klippenstein. “I’m sure glad the Jats have decided to bring it back yet.”
The new Eaton’s basement store will feature slightly-used mattresses, mix-matched nylons, and Chesterfields with autumnal floral patterns.
“Nah, oba! It’ll be nice to finally pay a reasonable price for something at the MTS Centre,” said Klippenstein. “Now, if only they’ll lower the price on beer.”
The new Eaton’s Emm Kjalla is open exclusively to Mennonites as a Plautdietsch password will be required upon entry.
“Tell ’em Mrs. Klippenstein sent you,” said Mrs. Klippenstein. “And say it with the proper acksant. They’ll let you in.”

The Truth About Bert and Ernie Finally Revealed!,"SESAME STREET, KS
After decades of rumours, the truth about Sesame Street residents Bert and Ernie has finally been revealed! In an exclusive interview with the Daily Bonnet, Ernie admitted what we had all been suspecting for quite some time.
“We’re schekjbenjels,” said Ernie. “I hold ladders over at the Klippenstein farm, while Bert fetches things from the truck for Mr. Penner.”
Ernie also played the Mennonite game for a while, and it was discovered he’s a Friesen from Altona, while Bert is in the Loewen Book.
“We’ve known each other since our days on the Plett poultry farm. That was where I developed my affection my good pal the rubber ducky,” said Ernie. “He’s still the one.”
When asked whether he and Bert were more than just friends, Ernie did not hesitate to reply.
“Of course we are,” said Ernie. “We hand out bulletins together every third Sunday at church.”
In other news, sources say that Snuffleupagus will be bringing the message this Sunday and Oscar the Grouch has now been promoted to head elder.

Local Gamers Excited for Release of “Call of Duty: Morden Warfare”,"MORDEN, MB
Video game players across the Pembina Valley have lined up outside local Walmarts and Giant Tigers this week for the release of ‘Call of Duty: Morden Warfare.’
“Jauma, I can’t wait to try it yet,” said Herman Wiebe, 19, from his unkempt room in his parent’s basement. “I’m sure this Morden Warfare game will be the best one aver!”
The new game is set in Morden, Manitoba and requires players to fight their way down Stephen Street to meet hostile Winkler forces at the local Chicken Chef.
“Dat’s where the horseshoes competition takes place,” said Wiebe. “I haven’t got that far into the game yet. I’m still at the part where I have to rescue Mrs. Dueck from the local manor and take her out for a nice meal at the Kopper Kettle.”
Call of Duty: Morden Warfare tests the gamer’s stamina and hand-eye coordination while they’re expected to maneuver their character past the local bar without stopping in for a drink.

Anti-Fracking Protestors Shut Down Schmaunt Fat Production,"LA CRETE, AB
Dozens of angry protestors showed up to La Crete City Hall this past week to protest the fracking of schmaunt fat.
“Fracking is an unsafe method of schmaunt fat extraction,” said Billy Wiebe. “It causes earthquakes and allows schmaunt fat to seep into our drinking water.”
Schmaunt fat has traditionally been extracted using wells or open mining, but some schmaunt fat producers have resorted to fracking to access underground schmaunt fat reserves.
“We call on the Alberta government to immediately ban fracking of schmaunt fat,” said Wiebe. “Just say ‘No’.”
Proponents of fracking claim it’s perfectly safe and is the only way to get the much needed schmaunt fat.
“Besides who would really complain if you got a little schmaunt fat in your drinking water,” said businessman Arnie Fast.

Mennonite Church Choir Reveals New Third Jersey,"WINNIPEG, MB
The Osterwick Old Colony Choir and Farmer Sausage Co-operative has revealed a new alternate jersey for the 2018-2019 season. The new jersey, which contains purple flowers rather than the regular blue or yellow, will be worn on special occasions when the choir really feels like they need some extra support from the crowd. However, not everyone was happy with the new uniform.
“I hate it,” said Mennonite choir fan Peter Funk. “I think they’re just releasing this new flower pattern to make a few bucks.”
The choir usually alternates between the blue or yellow flower patterns depending on whether they’re singing in their home church in Osterwick or on the streets of the big city. To a lot of fans, the third jersey seemed a bit redundant.
“How many changes of clothes does one Mennonite really need?” said Funk. “Plus I think this new one is kind of ugly.”
Funk says he doesn’t like the change, but says it’s better than the alternate jersey released by that choir over in Chortitz a few years back.
“Ugh, cammo? Seriously!” said Funk. “Not only it is ugly, but it hardly seems appropriate for a Mennonite choir.”
Despite some objections, dozens of new Osterwick choir jerseys were seen blowing in the wind on Mrs. Martens clothesline this weekend.

A List of the Best Items Available at Mrs. Friesen’s Garage Sale This Weekend,"KRONSGART, MB
One of the perks of writing the Daily Bonnet is that you get early access to garage sales. So, I’ve been scouting out all the local garage sales and I’m here to provide you with the inside scoop on what to expect this week. The top of the heap is definitely Mrs. Friesen of Kronsgart. Here’s just a small taste of the amazing items up for grabs. Mrs. Friesen’s garage sale begins at 8:30 AM this Thursday. Act quickly because by Saturday, you can expect all this good stuff to be gone.
Homemade Dills – $6 a jar – Mrs. Friesen has just two jars left of her famous dills. This vintage pair has been in her cellar since ’83, so these are definitely the dilliest pickles in Kronsgart. Snatch them up while you can!

Henry’s bottle cap collection – $0.50 – Mr. Friesen has been collecting beer bottle caps since the late 1970s and Mrs. Friesen says it’s time to get “this rubbish out of the house.” She’s encouraged her husband to get into woodworking instead.

Cousin Peter’s stash of Christian Archie comics – $0.25 a piece –  Mrs. Friesen assures me she’s only selling Christian Archies, as she made sure to toss out Peter’s regular Archies a long time ago.

One gently used set of hair curlers – $2 – Mrs. Friesen claims she hasn’t used them since the late 1980s and they’re in “tip top shape!”

Uncle Darryl’s sketchy collection of VHS tapes – $0.50 each – This is a collection of films recorded late night on French CBC by Uncle Darryl when he was still living at home. Mrs. Friesen is not sure what’s on the tapes, but hopes they go to a good home.

Local Quilting Ladies Accidentally Attend Metallica Concert,"WINNIPEG, MB
The ladies from the Winkler EMMB Quilting Group were heading into the city on one of their monthly outings. They had intended to attend a panel discussion at the Millennium Library, when a mixup in the elevator led them to the arena with a bunch of slovenly metal fans.
“Oh, jauma, this is certainly not was I was expecting,” said veteren quilter Mrs. Brandt, 73. “Thousands of young men thrashing about in unwashed T-shirts and smelling worse than Uncle Henry after feeding the pigs.”
When the mix-up was discovered, Mrs. Brandt immediately demanded their quick departure, but the others were not convinced.
“We drove all this way from Vankla,” said Mrs. Friesen. “We might as well stick around for Kirk Hammett’s solo on ‘Ride the Lightning.'”
The other quilters agreed with Mrs. Friesen and soon found themselves in a sweaty mosh pit in the middle of the crowd.
“Oba, I’ve never seen Mrs. Wiebe crowd-surf like that before,” said Mrs. Friesen. “At church she’s a lot more reserved.”
After the concert, the quilters’ ears were ringing as they drove home to Winkler and vowed never to tell their husbands what they really did in the big city.

Custodian at Local Senior’s Home Can’t Get the Smell of Roll Kuchen Out of the Hallway,"STEINBACH, MB
The hallways at Menno Garden Manor still smell strongly of cooking oil after half a dozen women all decided to fry up some roll kuchen on the very same day. Mr. Pankratz, a retired shekjbenjel and resident fix-it-man, has been trying to remove the smell all week, but to no avail.
“I’ve gone door-to-door and pleaded with every Loewen or Dueck in the place to open up their windows and let things air out a little,” explained Pankratz. “But it still smells like roll kuchen!”
Pankratz says the whole thing started with Mrs. Wiebe who fried up a batch for the weekly Wiebe Family Roll Kuchen Frenzy, but eventually five other ladies decided to get in on the festivities.
“They were hauling out pots and dumping in oil like it was going out of style,” said Pankratz. “You should see all the watermelon rinds they’ve got stacked up in the elevator.”
Pankratz says he may have to resort to extreme measures.
“The only way I can think of to mask the smell would be to douse all the residents in Rogers Golden Syrup as they enter the building,” said Pankratz, who is already rigging up a contraption to do just that. “If this doesn’t work, I’m moving out!”

Doug Ford Vows to Downsize Mennonite Elder Boards,"TORONTO, ON
Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he plans in invoke the “notwithstanding clause” to defend his efforts to reduce the number of elders on local Mennonite church boards.
“The elder boards in the Kitchener-Waterloo have ballooned in recent years and it’s costing the people far too much in German sausages and baked goods,” says Ford. “As of today, every Mennonite church must be run by a committee of just two hog farmers and the church organist.”
Some have criticized the Premier for meddling where he doesn’t belong, but Ford says he’s just doing what the good people of Ontario elected him to do.
“These elder boards are bloated, inflated, monstrosities,” says Ford. “I don’t see why anyone should complain about this decision. Hey, at least I’m not selling hash.”
Ford says his decision is final and nothing will convince him otherwise, although he has still not responded to widespread pressure for him to also downsize his bloated and inflated head.

Winnipeg’s most famous former landfill, Garage Hill, will be returned to its former glory later this month after the landmark received a renewed surge in interest as of late.
“It’s time we make Garbage Hill great again!” shouted one protestor, sporting a MGHGA hat. “I remember the days when this hill was a glorious mound of trash and it’s time we returned it to that status once again!”
The hill was recently christened with a large Garbage Hill sign just like in Hollywood, but protestors are saying the sign is not enough.
“As everyone knows, the past was better in every way, so we need to starting dumping our trash there again and make Garbage Hill the highest peak in Manitoba,” said the man. “Move over Baldy Mountain! Garbage Hill is coming for you!”
There are also plans to turn Polo Park Mall back into a horse track and force the Jets to play out a newly restored Eaton’s building.

Local Man Forgets to Remove Nikes Before Burning Them,"HENDERSON, NB
Mr. Allan Janzen of Henderson is being treated for first degree burns this week after lighting his Nikes on fire while still wearing them. According to family members, Janzen was burning his shoes in protest to the Nike Colin Kaepernick ad.
“Jauma lied, fire is hot yet!” said Janzen, attempting to extricate himself from his Air Jordans. “Oba, look what I’ve done now!”
Janzen was quite upset at the Nike ad featuring controversial former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick who kneeled during the national anthem.
“As soon as I saw that ad, I knew I had to do something,” said Janzen, “and so I immediately went over to the bathroom to get the matchbook that my Tina always keeps in there. I’m not sure why it’s there, but anyway, I struck a match and then I thought, oh, Pieta, look what you’ve done!”

Manitoba Man Survives Three Days and Three Nights in the Belly of a Red River Catfish,"LOCKPORT, MB
Local man Jonah Neufeld, 35, of West Kildonan was out fishing at Lockport with his buddies Darrel Froese and Joel Peters this past weekend, when he was suddenly pulled into the Red River by a monstrous catfish.
“I couldn’t believe it,” said Froese, who witnessed the event. “That darn catfish swallowed him whole!”
Froese and Peters were certain their life-long friend and fishing partner was a goner.
“There was nothing we could do, so we just packed up our gear and headed home,” said Peters. “On the way home we played Rock Paper Scissors and I lost. That means I had to tell Jonah’s wife Bethany the bad news.”
Bethany was understandably distressed at the thought of her husband being swallowed by a channel catfish, but says it’s all part of the risk of having a catfishing husband.
“I knew this was a possibility when I married him,” said Bethany. “That’s why I never let the kids go along.”
Thankfully Mr. Neufeld was spat up onto the shore near Lake Winnipeg a few days later.
“Those catfish are a nasty bunch,” said Neufeld. “I think I’m going to stick to Walleye from now on. Plus, they taste a hell of a lot better.”

Penner Discovered in Reimer Book,"STEINBACH, MB
Shock waves are spreading throughout the Mennonite community of Steinbach this week as a Penner was discovered in the Reimer book. It’s not known how the Penner got into the Reimer family tree, but investigators are on the case.
“Oba! Never in all my wildest dreams – or should I say, nightmares – did I ever imagine I’d be related to one of them Penners!” exclaimed Mr. Reimer. “Next thing you know I’ll be related to a Friesen yet!”
The Reimer book has been scrutinized for its authenticity, and Mennonite scholars have concluded that, yes, a Penner married into the Reimer family during the 1870s.
“In those days there wasn’t much choice,” said Dr. Thiessen. “Either you marry a Penner or that’s the end of the family tree for you. Those were hard times, let me tell you.”
Dr. Thiessen said we shouldn’t judge people from another time and place for the decisions they had to make.
“You weren’t there, going through what they were going through,” said Dr. Thiessen, “so who are you to say what you might have done in that situation. Who knows, you might have been so desperate that you’d marry a Penner, too.”

New Improved Horse Gets Up to 60 Miles Per Carrot,"HESSTON, KS
The folks at Hershberger Horses and More have been working hard over the past few centuries to improve carrot-efficiency in local horses and the results have finally paid off. With regular maintenance, their new improved horse can now record up to sixty miles per carrot.
“All the other horses are doing like 20 to 30 MPC, but we’ve really blown them out of the water with this one and got 60 MPC,” explained Mr. Hershberger. “I really think this new carrot-efficient horse is a game-changer for the local Mennonite population.”
Mennonites in the area are always looking to reduce carrot usage, increase production and “go green” if they can.
“Just think of all the carrots we’re saving with these new horses,” says Hershberger. “Every mile we plow, we’re preventing an acre of rain forest from being bulldozed to build more carrot fields.”

Mrs. Friesen Confesses to Writing Anonymous Op-Ed,"WASHINGTON, DC
There has been much mystery and speculation surrounding the authorship of an anonymous editorial in the New York Times recently. The op-ed stated that someone was working “from the inside” to bring down the Trump administration. At it turns out the anonymous op-ed writer was none other than our very own Mrs. Friesen of Winkler!
“The authorship should have been obvious by the use of so many Plautdietsch phrases,” says CNN analyst Don Lemon. “I’m not sure how we missed ‘Nah, junges! Oba, Donald, nijch goot.”
Mrs. Friesen, 85, was hired by the Trump administration to make quilts and doilies for the West Wing, but now says she’s actually been covertly working to undermine his leadership.
“Covfefe? That was all my doing!” said Mrs. Friesen. “I’ve also been swapping out his dills with bread and butter pickles and replacing the sugar cubes with salt licks!”
It seems Mrs. Friesen’s tactics have been successful, as the administration has never before been in quite such a precarious position as it is now.
“Oh, and those quilts I’ve been making? They’re not half as warm as the ones I’ve been making for the grandkids!” says Mrs. Friesen. “That’ll show him!”
After news of the op-ed was released, Mrs. Friesen was immediately signed to a multi-million dollar advertising contract with Nike.",NaN,"September 6, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/grandma-e1536252782332.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Like and Share if You Think People Should Stop Indicating their Agreement by Liking and Sharing,"Friends, Mennonites, countrymen, lend me your ears!
For too long we’ve been told that the entirety of our self-expression is tied to our willingness to like and/or share stupid memes on Facebook. We are told that doing so will provide us with health, wealth and prosperity, if only we like and/or share some insipid post someone made on social media.
To pass up on the opportunity to share, will mean we just aren’t spiritual or politically-engaged or team-players. Failure to like/share is, according to social media logic, a failure of us as human beings.
Political and religious memes are created specifically to elicit strong feelings. They’re designed to get us to agree with them and algorithms assure that we will only see the posts that engage the strongest of emotions in each of us. In other words, we are being played.

Bible School Offering Money Back Guarantee if Not Engaged By the End of First Semester,"FOUR MOUNTAINS, AB
In an effort to boost enrolment, starting this fall, the Bible School of Southern Alberta is offering students a 100% money-back guarantee if they’re not engaged by the end of the first semester.
“We want everyone to know that BSSA is a place where you walk out of here with a diploma in your hand and a ring on your finger,” said school chancellor Wiebe. “This year, we’re pulling out all the stops to make sure no student leaves this campus unengaged.”
For years the campus was known for it’s gender-segregated blue and pink sidewalks, but these have been painted over to a neutral yellow.
“From now on you can walk to and from class with that Janzen boy or that Klassen girl – it’s up to you!” said Wiebe. “And we’ve got a prayer hotline 24/7 for people who need a little extra help in the romance department.”
Wiebe, however, admits there are a few students he’s a little worried about.
“I’m optimistic, but, still, there are a handful of students who are a little distracted from what should be their goal. I’ve noticed a few around here who seem to be focusing on growing in their faith and learning more about the Scriptures,” explained Wiebe. “There’s not much we can do about it, other than showcase what we have to offer and hope they’ll take the bait.”

Cairn to Honour Steinbach’s Founder St. Einbach,"STEINBACH, MB
A local history committee has decided it was about time there was some acknowledgement of Steinbach’s patron saint and founder St. Einbach. A large cairn depicting St. Einbach, riding a traditional Mennonite chariot, was revealed at a ceremony this morning.
“We are here today to honour our founder and leader St. Einbach,” said committee chair Wilbur Schellenberg. “The Einbach family established a homestead on this very place, right across from what is now Chicken Chef.”
Schellenberg says that the community was known as St. Einbach until the 1920s, when the elders wanted a name that would distance themselves from all the Catholic towns nearby.
“But make no mistake, this man was a true saint,” said Schellenberg. “He was the first to successfully turn cow’s milk into schmaunt fat and is also known for performing the miracle of the 15% tip at a Sal’s in Vanapag.”
The St. Einbach cairn is the first in a series of new initiatives to commemorate the local hero.
“A tire park in his honour is also in the works,” said Schellenberg. “When the kids slide down the zip line we want them to think about nothing but our dear leader St. Einbach.”

Ken Ham and Kent Hovind to Guest Star in Series Finale of ‘The Big Bang Theory’,"HOLLYWOOD, CA
Stars of the literal 6-day creationist world will square off against a bunch of fictional physicists in the series finale of hit sitcom ‘The Big Bang Theory’ later this year.
“We’re so excited to have Ken and Kent join us this season!” said ‘Big Bang Theory’ star Jim Parsons. “In our final episode, we plan to settle this whole big bang debate once and for all!”
Ken Ham and Kent Hovind have been known across the state of Tennessee and in small towns in other states as well, for their vigorous defence of their particular interpretation of Scripture and/or science. This is the first time either one of them will debate a fictional character…other than that one debate with Bill Nye the Science Guy.
“Real scientists always turn us down,” said Ham. “I’m glad to see Sheldon Cooper is not as afraid to debate as Richard Dawkins always seems to be!”
Ken and Kent plan to use their very best evidence, the ergonomic shape of a banana, to defeat the characters on ‘Big Bang Theory.’
The episode, which airs later this year, will be completely scripted, which Ken and Kent claim is yet even more evidence of intelligent design. Meanwhile the cast of ‘Big Bang Theory’ are claiming that the script just exploded into existence from nothing billions of years ago.

Report: Shallow Repetitive Worship Songs More Pleasing to the Lord than Hymns,"LANCASTER, PA
A report out of the University of Southern Lancaster suggests that really shallow, repetitive, self-indulgent ‘Praise and Worship’ songs are a full 20% more pleasing to the Lord than the boring old hymns.
“I’m pretty sure the Lord prefers my epic guitar solo to some crappy old hymn with meaningful words and stuff,” said local worship leader Austin Holmes. “Also, the more times a worship song uses the word ‘I’ the better.'”
The study asked members of contemporary evangelical churches to listen to both hymns and modern choruses and then rate their feeling of ‘total awesomeness’ on a scale of one to ten.
“I’ve never felt as close to my lord Hillsong as I did during last week’s service,” said one congregant. “I just don’t get the same feeling when singing some stupid old hymn.”
The study also showed that churches received 50% more money in the offering when they played emotional music while the plates were passed.
“Clearly the Lord enjoys solipsistic drivel to hymns,” said Holmes. “And I don’t blame him. The songs are totally rad!”

Mennonite Judges to Score Miss America Swimsuit Competition,"LAS VEGAS, NV
For the first time since the pagent began almost 100 years ago, Miss America’s swimsuit competition will be judged exclusively by a panel of Mennonite church deacons.
“Our criteria may be a little different from the regular judges,” said Mr. Wall of Kansas. “We’re not as concerned about thigh gap as the rest of them seemed to be.”
The Mennonite judges have asked to observe the women milking cows, making quilts, and sporting rubber boots.
“We’re not just interested in them parading back and forth in a bikini,” said Wall. “We want to know what these ladies are made of.”
The Mennonite judges have been brought in to improve the image of the Miss America competition, which has suffered over the past few years with numerous blunders.
“We’re looking for wholesome women with evidence of plow experience,” said Wall. “The bathing suits better be modest!”
Miss Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, and Kansas are rumoured to be the front-runners this year.

Local Man’s Hilarious Wikipedia Edit About Mennonites Goes Unnoticed for Six Years,"WATERLOO, ON
Back in the winter of 2012, then Conrad Grebel student, Jakob Klassen, 23, of Aylmer edited the Wikipedia page about Mennonites to include numerous hilarious but erroneous bits of information. Klassen was shocked to discover that at least one of his edits remained on the page a full six years later.
“In the very first paragraph of the page it said, ‘Rather than fight, the majority of these followers survived by fleeing to neighboring states where ruling families were tolerant of their belief in schmaunt fat,'” explained Klassen. “Originally it said, ‘their belief in believer’s baptism,’ but I spiced things up a little.”
Conrad Grebel history professor Dr. Amelia Friesen says she still sees this schmaunt fat reference in undergraduate papers to this day.
“I always tell them to cite primary sources, but they just don’t listen,” said Dr. Friesen. “And, see, this is what happens! You end up quoting some stupid schumant fat joke from half a decade ago.”
Other misleading information about Mennonites that has crept into undergrad essays includes the idea that MCC stood for “Mennonite Cow Caressers” and that the only difference between a Mennonite and a Hutterite is that Mennonites are too cheap to buy the uniform. Klassen, however, says he has no regrets.
“All these years later I still think it’s funny,” says Klassen, now a youth pastor at a local Pentecostal church. “You should see the edits I made about the Amish!”

Six Hospitalized After Jesus Takes the Wheel,"GOSHEN, IN
Four Yoders and two Millers were rushed to the hospital in Goshen this week after Mr. Yoder decided to relinquish his driving duties and let Jesus take over.
“I was heading down the 33 towards Elkhart, when I just decided to let Jesus take the wheel,” explained Yoder. “So I just put the cruise control on and scooched on over to the passenger seat.”
Having recently got a wheel alignment, Yoder said everything seemed to be going fine, until they had to make a sharp left turn on Lusher.
“The car just when straight on through and slammed into the Millers,” said Yoder. “Luckily there were only minor injuries, but this whole thing has really shaken us up. We’re all really starting to question the theological veracity of country lyrics.”
Yoder has been charged with Driving Under the Influence of Carrie Underwood and, if convicted, could face up to three years in prison listening to that song not stop. Thankfully for Yoder, his pastor has been a real support in his time of need.
“I’m warning everyone against taking Carrie Underwood too literally,” said Pastor Jim. “In terms of driving advice derived from Christian pop culture, it seems to me that ‘God is My Co-Pilot’ is a much safer option.”",NaN,"August 30, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ambulance-1-e1521175715156.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonite Church Uses Potato Sack Race to Determine New Pastor,"LINDEN, AB
Deviating from the common practice of determining all leadership positions by the drawing of straws, the folks at West Linden Mennonite have decided to pick a new head honcho using a potato sack race. In contention were seminary graduates Mr. Dueck and Mr. Froese, as well as little Timmy Wiebe, who’s now entering grade seven.
“It was really sad to see Mr. Dueck go down like that,” said church board member, Mr. Pankratz. “He’s the only ordained minister among the bunch. I guess they should spend less time studying Greek and more time on their sack racing skills.”
After fifty metres, it was a tight race between Mr. Froese and Timmy Wiebe, although a hip check by an onlooker sent Mr. Froese flying and gave Timmy Wiebe the victory.
“I’d like to thank my buddy Alex Penner for laying one on Mr. Froese like that,” said Timmy Wiebe. “From now on the kids are in charge of West Linden!”
Reverend Wiebe says there are going to be some big changes around the church, starting with a massive Fortnite tournament this Sunday morning.
“The sermons will also be a lot shorter,” said Reverend Wiebe. “And no more vegetables at faspa!”
Members of West Linden pastoral search committee, say they are satisfied with the results and may look into using potato sack races to determine other leadership positions in the church.
“I think we might make them arm wrestle for the Women’s Ministry chair and maybe a three-legged race to figure out who’ll be the new Sunday School superintendent,” said Mr. Pankratz. “It’ll save us a lot of hours in long boring committee meetings.”
The church is also planning to use potato sack races to determine a position on contentious doctrinal issues, saying it’s the only way to prevent another schism.

Alt-Right Group Protests Wildfire Smoke that’s “Illegally” Crossing into the US from Canada,"SPOKANE, WA
There was a massive demonstration in Spokane this week as between five and seven people showed up to protest the wildfire smoke that’s been illegally crossing the border in the last couple weeks.
“We’re here in solidarity with the good hard-working Americans who take their health seriously,” said Mr. Appleton, who finished off a carton of Camels during the interview. “Smoke is coming over illegally and it’s about time we put a stop to it! Build the wall! Build the wall!”
The group is demanding that any smoke that wishes to cross the border should stop and present ID at an official border crossing.
“We’ve got to know exactly what kind of smoke is crossing our border,” said Appleton. “We all know the type of smoke that comes from B.C. and it’s nothing we want in our wholesome country!”
The protest went on for a good fifteen minutes or so before the group, exhausted and tired, stopped to take a KFC break.
“This is our land and we should decide the smoke that comes in and out of the country,” Appleton said. “You don’t see me going to Canada and fouling up the air!”

Anabaptist Heroes to be Added to Mount Rushmore,"BLACK HILLS, SD
Four new faces are set to be blasted into the rock at Mount Rushmore this fall. After a long consultation process, a committee has selected the names of Menno Simons, Conrad Grebel, Jakob Amman and Jakob Hutter.
“There’s plenty of bare rock up there we haven’t already defaced,” said Mount Rushmore spokesperson Leon Butler. “We might as well add on some pictures of long dead Anabaptists that most people have never even heard of.”
Simons, Grebel, Amman, and Hutter will join the likes of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt at a cost of $30 million per head. There has also been some discussion of adding two others, but this would mean removing two Presidents.
“We can make some more room if we remove Washington and Jefferson,” explained Butler. “If it means getting Felix Manz up there, I’m all for it.”
Opportunistic locals have already begun selling miniature models of the new 8-headed Rushmore.
“They’re just $40, or $5 a head,” said Mr. Jansen. “For an extra five bucks I’ll even chisel your Aunt Bertha on there is you want.”

Residents Required to Display ‘Steinbach Driver’ Sign in Back Windshield,"STEINBACH, MB
Under a new local graduated licensing program, Steinbach drivers will now be required to display a sign in the back windshield of their vehicles as a warning to other drivers. Local officials say the program will improve safety and reduce instances of road rage.
“Why isn’t that vehicle establishing himself in the intersection? Why is that minivan clogging up all the traffic in the left lane? Why is that pickup truck driving 20 in a 50 zone?” said Steinbach safety officer Dale Wheeler. “This sign will help answer those questions and alleviate some frustrations when people see it and realize, ‘Oh, hey, it’s a Steinbach driver out there. Go easy on them.'”
Steinbachers will also be required to have a competent driver who knows what they’re doing in the front passenger seat at all times.
“Whenever Martha and Abe want to take the ’95 Oldsmobile out for a spin, one of them is going to have to sit in the back, while your designated non-Steinbach driver accompanies you in the passenger seat,” explained Wheeler. “Steinbach drivers will also not be allowed to have passengers in their vehicle after eight at night.”
Local officials are not really too worried about night driving, however, as most Steinbachers are in bed by just after seven.
“The new signs will be in the mail this week, so I expect to see them prominently displayed in Steinbach vehicles this fall,” said Wheeler. “By the end of the year, we’re hoping that the new program will improve the driving skills of Steinbachers to such a degree that they’re only as bad as Winkler drivers.”
So far, Winkler drivers are not being required to display the sign, because they’re easy to identify already.
“You can spot them a mile away,” said Wheeler. “You just look for grey-haired couples taking it slow in the Walmart parking lot.”
The ‘Steinbach Driver’ signs are already popping up on vehicles across the city, but are most noticeable just after church on Sunday afternoons.",NaN,"August 26, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steinbachdriver-1.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Morden Honours Local Star Loreena McKennitt with Totally Epic Corn Maze,"MORDEN, MB
The city of Morden, Manitoba will be honouring its most famous export, celtic music sensation Loreena McKennitt, in the best way they know how, by building a corn maze in her honour.
“Basically we’ve combined the two things Morden is most known for, Loreena McKennitt and corn,” said maze designer Pattie Fehr. “When viewed from space, the corn maze looks just like Loreena playing the accordion. I have to warn you, though, once you find your way into the hair section, you’re really in for some trouble.”
The Loreena McKennitt Corn Maze is already being called the most challenging corn maze ever built in Morden.
“You’ll be lucky if you’re out in less than six hours,” said Fehr. “By the time you’re finished, you’ll probably never want to hear ‘The Mummers’ Dance’ ever again.”
The maze, which covers more than fifty acres, also contains loudspeakers blasting McKennitt’s signature new age music at all the lost children.
“The good thing is that you can also grab an ear of corn if you get hungry after three or four hours,” said Fehr. “I’m really proud of our work on the corn maze this year.”
It is not known whether Loreena, herself, will show up to try her hand at the maze, though most Mordeners have their doubts.

Mennonite Couple Celebrates Anniversary By Ordering the Cheapest Thing on the Menu,"SASKATOON, SK
The Rempels from over in Herschel drove into the city this week to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary in style by ordering the very cheapest items on the menu at Tony Roma’s.
“Oba, I guess no onion loaf for me,” said Mrs. Rempel, aghast at the outrageous $13 price tag. “Hmmm, what can I order? Cajun seared mahi mahi? Nope. St. Louis Ribs? Nah, junges! Looks like it’s the house salad for me!”

Mennonite Politician Splits from Conservatives to Form the Tupperware Party,"OTTAWA, ON
It seems Maxine Bernier is not the only one leaving the Conservative Party to form one of his own. Mennonite MP Cassandra Petkau of the Neuhochenfeld Riding has become disgruntled and is seeking to form a new entity that she thinks will unite people with her values: The Tupperware Party.
“Oba, I’ve been to some of these so-called conservative parties and, let me tell you, there’s nothing conservative about them. It’s just talk, talk, talk. But where are the rolled up ham slices and jello salads?” explained Petkau. “If you want to host a conservative party, you need to have Tupperware!”
The Tupperware Party plans to run candidates in all 338 ridings, but are most hopeful in areas like Winkler, Leamington, and the Fraser Valley of British Columbia.
“I’ve been going door-to-door throughout southern Manitoba this week handing out my delicious puffed wheat cake and listening to the concerns of the people,” said Petkau. “I think there’s some real momentum building for the Tupperware Party.”
One early supporter is Mrs. Klassen of Kleefeld who said she’s been seeking an alternative to the mainstream parties for years.
“They just don’t speak for me and what I care about, but the Tupperware Party does,” said Mrs. Klassen. “I can’t understand why none of the others parties are offering a burping seal or a free orange peeler.”
In a recent Ipsos-Reid poll, The Tupperware Party is already leading the pack with a serious chance of forming a majority government in the next election.

Jets Ink Morrissey to Long Term Deal,"WINNIPEG, MB
After months of negotiation the Winnipeg Jets announced today that they have inked legendary British alternative rocker Morrissey to a five-year deal.
“We’re really glad to have Morrissey locked up for the next few years,” said Jets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff. “Morrissey has proven himself to be an elite defenseman. I also hear he’s got a great singing voice, too.”
According to sources, the Jets had been negotiating with the former Smiths frontman for more than four months before they discovered the mixup.
“At that point we were so far into the negotiations that we figured, ‘what the heck’ and signed the man,” said Cheveldayoff. “For a Brit, he sure knows a lot about hockey.”
Hockey pundits were initially baffled by the signing, but eventually many of them came on board.
“Hey, if we get to hear ‘There is a Light that Never Goes Out’ every day before the game, I’ll all for it,” said TSN analyst Bob McKenzie. “I’m hoping he does ‘Bigmouth Strikes Again’ during the second intermission.”
Josh Morrissey, in the meantime, remains unsigned, but rumours have it he’s thinking of getting back together with guitarist Johnny Marr.

Mennonite Heritage Village Offers Time Travel for a Lot Less than the Cost of a Delorean,"STEINBACH, MB
If a flux-capacitor-equipped Delorean is a little out of your price range, the folks at the Mennonite Heritage Village in Steinbach offer a chance to go back to the 1870s for just a modest admission fee.
“Great Scott! If I had known about this place in Steinbach, I wouldn’t have spent all those years on that infernal time machine,” said Doc Brown from his home in Hill Valley. “Oba, that machine has brought me nothing but trouble!”
Doc Brown, who has frintschoft in southern Manitoba, visited the Steinbach area with his young friend Marty McFly, where they were pulled over by local police attempting to get up to 88 mph just outside the museum grounds.
“As it turns out, you can time travel without having to go at such speeds,” said Marty McFly. “Who knew time travel could be so safe and convenient.”
So far the Steinbach museum offers the chance to time travel into the past, but Marty McFly is hoping they’ll also expand the technology by offering a glimpse into the distant future.
“I’d love to see Mennonites with flying buggies,” said McFly. “And I wonder if they’ll still be using the same schmaunt fat recipe in the year 2200.”

Local Man Drives 20 Miles Before Realizing McDonald’s Drive-Thru Didn’t Give Him Any Ketchup,"HIGHWAY 44, MB
Winnipeg man Richard Giesbrecht, 47, was well on his way to Whitemouth Lake this weekend before he realized that, once again, the McDonald’s drive-thru had failed to provide him with any ketchup.
“I was just going to pull over and have my fries,” said Giesbrecht, “but, son of a gun, they didn’t give me any ketchup! How the heck am I supposed to eat these things!”
Giesbrecht rummaged around the bag for a few minutes, even checking below the McNuggets and under the Big Mac, but to no avail.
“They always do this to me!” exclaimed Giesbrecht. “I mean, seriously, how hard it is to throw a few packets of ketchup in the bag? Diewel!”
Giesbrecht briefly considering returning to the restaurant to claim his ketchup, but decided against it since he was almost at the lake already.
“Instead, I just tossed the fries in the back seat and decided I’d fish for my meal,” said Giesbrecht. “I caught a few nice pickerel. The only problem is I forgot to bring the tartar sauce!”
A representative from McDonald’s has apologized for the mix-up and says customers should make sure to ask for ketchup.
“I mean how else are we supposed to know,” said the rep. “What are we psychic? Same things goes for napkins.”

Steinbach Finally Legalizes Sundae Shopping,"STEINBACH, MB
Things sure are changing in the growing city of Steinbach. After heated debate this week, Steinbach city council voted 4 to 3 in favour of legalizing sundae shopping.
“This is something that has come up for discussion quite a lot,” said councillor Thiessen, devouring a delicious hot fudge treat. “They have sundae shopping in Winnipeg. They have sundae shopping in Portage. It was only a matter of time before we had sundae shopping in Steinbach, too.”
The council was under increasing pressure from the local business community who felt they were losing out on potential sales as Steinbachers did their sundae shopping in the big city.
“It’s true. We often go to BDI or something and get our sundae shopping done there,” said Mrs. Toews, who supports the change. “It’ll be nice to keep my sundae shopping money in the community.”
Children across the region were especially excited about the new law and the chance to finally try sundae shopping for themselves.
“I can’t wait to try it,”  said little Bethany. “I’ve heard sundae shopping is delicious!”
It seems the Steinbach city council agrees. Sundae shopping will commence in Steinbach next weekend, although locals are being warned not to spoil their appetites for faspa. Many were disappointed, however, to discover the new law restricts sundae sales to six days a week.

Manitoba Man Arrested for Complaining About the Heat,"WINNIPEG, MB
Local man Herman Toews never thought his casual comment about the weather would land him in jail, but he found out on Wednesday that complaining about the heat in a city known for its frigid winters is an arrestable offence.
“All I did was turn to my buddy Mike and say, ‘Boy, it sure is hot out today,’ and the next thing you know I was in cuffs,” said Toews. “Manitobans sure are defensive about their three days of summer.”
As temperatures have reached well above 30 degrees Celsius in the last few weeks, Manitobans are being reminded that complaining about the scorching heat means jail time.
“We’ve got snow ten months a year and you’re whining about a little sun!” said a sweaty and sunburnt Constable Friesen. “Not on my watch you don’t! The only kind of complaining I tolerate is moaning about our long cold winters. Anything else is simply unacceptable!”
Locals have even set up a community watch group to wander the streets of Winnipeg and look for anyone who might not be relishing our record-breaking hot summer.
“You better look like you’re enjoying it or we’re calling the cops,” said one volunteer. “If I see you reaching for that sun hat, you can better believe you’re going to Headingly!”

Children Terrified as Puppets Launch into Fiery ‘Hell and Damnation’ Sermon,"WICHITA, KS
Children attending a Daily Vacation Bible School this summer at East Wichita Mennonite were left in complete shambles after a seemingly innocent puppet show took a turn for the dark side. Instead of providing the kids with humorous little stories about obeying your parents and making your bed in the morning, the puppets immediately launched into a fire and brimstone sermon that would put a Baptist preacher to shame.
“The puppets introduced themselves as ‘Chuckles and Chester’ and then suddenly they were conjuring up images of a fiery lake of burning sulphur,” said a local mom. “Chester, in particular, really got into it, screaming and wailing and even demonstrating for the kids how to gnash your teeth.”
Chuckles and Chester then lambasted the audience of tots as vile sinners, before parents in attendance began to pull their crying children from the building, while Chester shouted ‘heathen!’ and ‘hell fire!’ at them as they made their escape.
“That Chester needs to learn a thing or two about how to talk to children,” said Mrs. Janzen. “He could at least tell a joke or talk in a silly voice or something. Plus, I think his theology is way off, too.”
Chuckles and Chester are touring Mennonite church basements across the region this fall, culminating with a huge tent revival meeting in Omaha on October 15, after which time Chester is planning to run for the GOP in the midterms.

Mennonite Publisher Releases Extra-Wide Bibles to Keep the Boys and Girls Farther Apart,"GOSHEN, IN
The Mennonite Bible Society of Indiana is excited to announce brand new extra-thick Bibles intended to provide extra distance between the boys and girls at summer camp, Sunday School, and other church functions.
“The width of the Bible has always been our measuring tool,” said Mr. Yoder, “but we’ve been noticing a pattern of thinner and thinner Bibles out there. I don’t know what they’re leaving out, but it’s sure making things difficult to manage at our campfire singalongs.”
‘Yoder’s Extra-Wide,’ as the new Bibles are called, are a full ten inches thick and have been padded out with Mr. Yoder’s detailed commentary below each verse, not that he’s expecting anyone to actually read it.
“These Bibles are strictly for measurement purposes,” said Mr. Yoder. “In fact I recommend wedging two or three of them in between the kids if things really get out of hand.”
Yoder says the Bibles can also be used to make sure hemlines are an adequate distance below the knees.
“I’m confident these are the most versatile Bibles ever published,” said Yoder. “You don’t even have to crack them open and you’ll be radically transformed.”

Mennonite Preacher Encourages Young People to ‘Hover Hand’,"WINKLER, MB
Reverend Toews of Vankla is praising his young people for maintaining the Mennonite tradition of not making any physical contact with the opposite sex. Recently, the phenomenon of the ‘hover hand’ was brought to his attention, which he praised as “the most Biblical way to take a picture.”
“I’m so glad to see the hover hand return to our society,” said Toews. “Back in my day, whenever a young woman would ask to take a selfie with you, as a chaste young man, I automatically placed my hands near but not actually on, the young woman’s shoulder. Us Mennonites invented the hover hand.”
Toews says more young people should practice the hover hand, but he said there was more that could be done.
“We also need to bring back the side hug,” said Toews. “Oh, and the six inch rule!”
After Toews’ stirring sermon on hover handing, even the old people were seen hover handing in the church lobby the next Sunday.
“I’m even doing the hover hand with my own wife,” said Uncle George. “It gives a good example to the young unmarried couples.”
Uncle George’s wife Tina said she was grateful that George was practicing the hover hand in church but wishes he’d keep his hands to himself during Sunday afternoon meddachschlop as well.",NaN,"August 15, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_2315-e1534100558247.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Saudi Arabia to Remove All Statues of Justin Trudeau,"RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA
After an online Twitter war with the Canadian Prime Minister about human rights, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made the decision to “immediately remove any and all statues of Justin Trudeau within the Kingdom.”
“There’s that really big one just outside the Masmak Fortress. That’s gotta go! Besides it’s completely covered in pigeon shit. What an eyesore,” said a Saudi representative. “It’s also not uncommon for our citizens to keep tiny hand-carved busts of Justin Trudeau just above their beds. Those are going to be rounded up and destroyed as well.”
Saudi police are also going door-to-door and examining everyone’s phones to make sure they don’t have a selfie with Mr. Trudeau stored on there somewhere.
“We’re ceasing any and all relations with Canada,” said the press release. “Except for the weapons they sell us. We’ll keep those.”
A Saudi representative said what he’d miss most is all the delicious Canadian maple syrup, but said it was worth it to teach Canada a lesson about diplomacy.
“Let this be a warning to all the countries of the world: if you want to trade with Saudi Arabia, you have to turn a blind eye to our atrocious human rights record,” said the memo. “It shouldn’t be that hard. You’ve all been doing it for decades already.”

Study: ‘Not All Mennonites Are Dicks’,"KITCHENER, ON
A new study from the University of Waterloo-Kitchener-Cambridge has revealed that, contrary to popular opinion, “not all Mennonites are Dicks.”
“Far from it,” said study organizer Dr. Lehman. “In fact, if you include Swiss Mennonites, there are very few Mennonite Dicks. Oh, sure, in Steinbach there are lot of Dicks, but in Southern Ontario and Pennsylvania and places like that, it’s just not the case.”
According to Dr. Lehman’s research, less than 20% of Mennonites are Dicks and most of the Dicks are concentrated in southern Manitoba.
“You go to the Pembina Valley and all the signs are Dick this and Dick that, but expand your horizons a little and you’ll find some non-Dick Mennonites as well,” said Lehman. “I think it’s really important that the public knows there’s a lot more to Mennonites than just the Dicks. We can’t let the Dicks shape everyone’s impression of who and what a Mennonite is.”
In order to educate the public, Dr. Lehman has erected Dick billboards across the country. The signs show a smiling Mennonite man, thumb tucked behind his suspenders, with the message: “MENNONITES: WE’RE NOT ALL DICKS.”
“I know the Dicks aren’t going to like it,” said Lehman, “but I’m sure the Fasts, Funks, and Penners will. They’re tired of being associated with the Dicks.”
Juvenile delinquents in Morden were tempted to deface the billboards, but decided against it as they couldn’t figure out a way of making it more suggestive than it already was.",NaN,"August 13, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dicks-e1532642033720.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
"Three Hours Later, Mennonite Man Still Working on that Piece of Chokecherry Pie","ROSETOWN, MB
Late last night Mennonite man, Samuel Fehr, 35,  was spotted at a Rosetown picnic shelter working his way through a piece of Oma’s chokecherry pie. Authorities intevened when Fehr was still there after 1 AM.
“But I’m not finished my pie,” complained Fehr as he was scooted away by local police. “It’s not my fault I have to pick out all the pits.”
Fehr was excited when he saw Grandma had made a pie, but was crestfallen when he heard it was chokecherry.
“I knew it was going to be a long night,” explained Fehr. “The last time I had chokecherry pie it look more than two full days to finish.”
Fehr claims chokecherry pie is “absolutely delicious, but a real pain in the ass,” and likens it to the process of picking bones from Grandpa’s Fehr’s freshly-caught pickerel.
“There’s just no way around it,” says Fehr. “Once you start on a chokecherry pie, you’re in for the long haul.”
The current record holder is Peter Wiebe of Altona who finished a standard piece of chokecherry pie is five hours and twenty-one minutes, a record that has stood since 1981.

Mennonite Man Beached on the Shores of Lake Winnipeg,"LAKE WINNIPEG, MB
A 43-year-old man from over by Reinland somewheres was found beached on the shores of Lake Winnipeg this weekend. Thankfully locals were able to keep him hydrated with Rogers Golden Syrup while rescuers rushed to the scene.
“We were just taking a walk on the beach, when I saw this creature lying there and I thought, ‘hey, that looks an awful lot like Corny Pankratz from Jantsied!” said Mr. Klassen, who, together with his lovely wife Martha, discovered Pankratz yesterday afternoon. “I don’t know how long he was lying there, but we immediately called the trachtmoaka. This man needed help!”
In fact, it look more a dozen amateur Mennonite chiropractors more than five hours to fully revive Mr. Pankratz and send him on his way back to Reinland.
“They were knacking and knipsing and kneedeling him for a long time yet,” said Mr. Klassen. “Finally he started to sputter a little and dan he really ferschlucked once and dan I knew he was going to be okay!”
The incident at Lake Winnipeg is not the first time a Mennonite man has been beached this summer. In fact, old Mr. Dietrich Toews was beached at the pits near Grunthal earlier in the summer.
“Formavorscht and swimming do not mix,” explained Mr. Klassen. “If you’re going to sit in your gonch with your belly hanging out make sure to do it in the privacy of your own front yard yet!

Mennonite Folklorama Pavilion the Only One Without Booze or Dancing,"WINNIPEG, MB
Folklorama, Winnipeg’s annual celebration of the city’s cultural diversity, is known for bringing the sights, tastes, and sounds of the world to the good people of Manitoba. The infamous Mennonite Pavilion, however, has developed a reputation for being a little on the dull side.
“Please come visit us at the Mennonite Pavilion. We guarantee you there will be no booze, no dancing, and no sitting within proximity of the opposite sex,” said Pavilion organizer Mr. Falk. “But if you want to eat rolled up ham slices and participate in a good responsive reading, then the Mennonite Pavilion is the place for you.”
The Pavilion is being held in a dark damp corner of the EMB church basement. Winnipeggers have been lining up all week.
“I’m impressed with the crowds,” said Mr. Falk. “Last night we had eight people: three elderly Friesens and a few of their grandkids who they tricked into coming along. And that was just the 7 o’clock show!”
Falk says the 9 o’clock performance was even more crowded, though they had to shut everything down by 9:05 because it was “more than past a decent bedtime yet.”
“Sure some of the other pavilions offer beer and you can watch a rousing dance performance,” said Mr. Falk. “But this is the only pavilion at Folklorama that invites guests to listen to an hour long sermon on chastity by Reverend Loewen!”

Elderly Mennonite Woman Picks Off Johnny Manziel Four Times in CFL Debut,"MONTREAL, QC
The Hamilton Tigercats were so confident in their ability to stop controversial former college star Johnny Manziel this week that they decided to bring in an elderly Mennonite woman on defence. And, boy, did their confidence pay off! Mrs. Froese, resident of Happy Meadows Retirement Home in Kitchener, managed to pick off QB Johnny Manziel four times in the first half alone.
“I have never seen a performance like that,” said one CFL commentator. “I mean Johnny Football just couldn’t get anything past that Mrs. Froese!”
Mrs. Froese, who turns 90 this week, said she was the Kitchener Bible School crokinole champion back in 1947 so she knows a thing or two about athleticism.
“I’m also unbeatable at Skipbo,” said Froese. “It’s no wonder I was able to handle the wobbly erratic passes of Johnny Manziel.”
Manziel was removed from the game early in the fourth quarter, but Mrs. Froese hopes he gets another chance to play.
“If I got to play Johnny Manziel every week, I’m sure I’d set a single-season record for interceptions,” said Mrs. Froese. “I might even switch the D-line so I can record a few sacks!”

Hipsters Flock to Rural Manitoba to Take Selfies with Knackzoat,"ALTONA, MB
After being warned to stay away from the sunflower plants, thousands of Winnipeg hipsters have descended upon corner stores and gas stations across southern Manitoba to have their pictures taken next to bags of knackzoat.
“The pile of shells in Mr. Penner’s backyard has also received quite the attention,” said local Spitz aficionado Kjnels Pankratz. “Every day the mountain grows and the visitors keep coming!”
Of particular interest to the Winnipeggers are the All Dressed and Salted variety of knackzoat, although, for some reason, residents of St. Boniface and St. Vital prefer to have their selfies taken with dill-flavoured knackzoat.
“They’re also enamoured with Mr. Penner’s ability to knack a mouthful of zoat without ever using his fingers,” said Pankratz. “That man’s amazing. His tongue usage is remarkable!”
Although many of these photographs ends up on sites like Facebook and Twitter, a growing number are appearing on a new social media app called Spitzagram.
“It’s basically just photos of old Mennonite men knacking zoat and drinking Papsi,” said Pankratz. “It’s amazing what these city people are interested in.”

"Pope Francis Bans Death Penalty; “Except, of course, for manspreaders,” he says","VATICAN CITY
Pope Francis modified centuries of church teaching this week by calling for the near complete abolishment of the death penalty, except for “particularly heinous crimes such as manspreading and those freakin’ annoying guys who take up both armrests on an airplane or in a movie theatre.”
“The Lord taught us to be peaceful and forgive those who wronged us,” said the Pontiff, “but He couldn’t possibly have meant to give a free pass to those morons on the city bus who jam their sharp and sweaty knees into the neighbouring seats. That’s inexcusable!”
Manspreading has become an epidemic in recent years, with one individual in Milan charged with more than a two hundreds counts of manspreading before being arrested this summer.
“He’s the worst serial manspreader this country has ever seen,” said Federico Rossellini, head of Milan police. “I’m hoping the Pope’s words will encourage more men to keep their legs closed and be more aware of the personal space of others.”

Selfie-Taking City Woman Eaten By Giant Mutant Venus Sunflower Plant,"ALTONA, MB
This summer thousands of city people have been flocking to the countryside to trample on farmer’s fields and take their stupid selfies with sunflower plants. Now it seems, the plants are beginning to fight back. Just outside Altona this week, a woman from River Heights ventured a little too far off the highway and was eaten whole by a giant mutant sunflower plant.
“We’re warning tourists from the city to be careful,” said local sunflower farmer Jakob Wiebe. “It seems a few of our plants have mated with Venus flytraps…and they’re very hungry for selfie-taking hipsters!”
Wiebe says he mourns the loss of the young woman, but says she should have taken a few precautions.
“You can’t just come to rural Manitoba with your New Balance sneakers and vintage SLR camera and expect nothing to happen,” said Wiebe. “Sunflowers are a sensitive plant, and they don’t take kindly to having unflattering photographs of them posted on Instagram. They need their privacy.”
The mutant sunflower plants have been popping up in fields across Canada and there is some evidence that they may spread to other crops as well.
“So far the flax and corn fields are not nearly so aggressive,” said Wiebe, “but I think city people should just play it safe and stick to photographing their meals and thigh gaps like they used to.”",NaN,"August 6, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sunflower-e1533512943306.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake

Millions of Homeless Canadian Refugees Flock to US Border After Heatwave Melts Igloos,"TORONTO, ON
After temperatures soared to five or ten degrees above freezing this August, igloos have melted across Canada, leaving desperate parka-clad Canadians with no choice but to descend on the United States in large packs. Millions of Canadian illegals have already snuck over the border and immediately began to put a drain on generous American social programs.
“They’re showing up in Minneapolis and Seattle and Cleveland and demanding we supply them with ketchup chips and cheese curds,” said one patriotic American. “And the worse thing is, they don’t even come over with their own guns!”
Anti-Canadian sentiment is growing in the United States, with the biggest fear being that American culture will be “watered down with namby-pamby Canadianisms.”
“You’ll see, soon they’re gonna start making us eat our fries with gravy and play three-down football. Not on my watch,” said a gun-wielding American at the Canada-US border. “I’ve even heard some of them are tunnelling all the way from Iceland! This has got to stop!”
Since the surge in illegal Canadians has come about very suddenly, the US government was unable to build the wall along the northern border.
“The heat wave was particularly bad this year. Canadians lost half their igloos and a sizeable chunk of their ice-fishing shacks,” said a government spokesperson. “Well, I hate to say it, but it looks like we’ll finally have to do something about global warming.”
While the surge in Canadians is a problem for the US, there have also been reports that a few Canadians have bypassed the US completely, and tunnelled their way into Mexico, where they have popped up near Puerto Vallarta somewhere. Reports also suggest that the Premier of Manitoba has tunnelled his way all the way to Costa Rica.",NaN,"August 4, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/igloo-e1533151690474.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Senator Joseph McCarthy Purchases Majority Share in CNN,"ATLANTA, GA
More than sixty years after leading the nation in mass anti-Russian hysteria, Senator Joseph McCarthy, long thought to be deceased, is back and heading up CNN.
“I wasn’t dead, I was just in hiding all these years,” said McCarthy from his Atlanta mansion. “I figured now was the time to come out and see how many secret Russians I could nail. Ever eaten a bowl of borscht? We’re coming for you!”
McCarthy plans to round up as many closet and/or secret Russians as he can find and punish them by making them appear on a CNN panel.
“Twenty minutes of Establishment Democrats yelling at you at the top of their lungs is more punishment than most people can handle,” said McCarthy. “Quite frankly I can hardly sit through more than thirty seconds of it.”
McCarthy says he was attracted to CNN because of their reputation for top notch journalism.
“I was especially impressed with their 24 hours nonstop coverage of important issues like Facebook memes,” said McCarthy. “The memes are coming! The memes are coming! Look out!”
The aging senator says he plans to call President Trump to testify in his new McCarthy trials, but Trump still insists he has no ties to Russia. When asked whether he was planning to meet with Joseph McCarthy, Trump simply replied “nyet.”

“The EMB associate pastor arrives!”

“A dream come true! A selfie with the Chicken Chef mascot!”

Next was a long line of guys name Jake Friesen riding tractors. I think there were close to twenty Jake Friesens in attendance, not to mention more than a dozen Pete Friesens.

“Forget handing out candy, the Penners are handing out everything you need for that perfect summa borscht.”

Mennonite Family Still Waiting in Line at Penner Foods Parcel Pick-up,"STEINBACH, MB
Almost thirty years after the store shut down, the Schellenberg family of Steinbach is still waiting on parcel #87 at the parcel pickup line at Penner Foods.
“Martha’s birthed three children in this parcel pickup line,” said Mr. Schellenberg. “Heck, we even had our first grandchild just last month.”
The Schellenbergs are still waiting for a parcel containing three bags of La Cocina chips, 300 grams of bologna and two rings of Bergman’s farmer sausage.
“Oba, that sausage is worth the wait,” said Mr. Schellenberg. “The last time I tried it back in 1987, it was quite tasty!”
According to sources the long wait is due to an error when young Timmy Friesen accidentally loaded the Schellenberg’s parcel into the Bueckert’s station wagon.
“I tried to tell the Schellenberg’s that, but they insisted on staying in line and waiting for their formavorscht,” said Timmy Friesen, now a Steinbach city councillor. “I really just wish the Bueckert’s would come back with that parcel and set the record straight.”
The Bueckerts, however, moved to Abbotsford in the mid-90s and haven’t been seen since…nor has their formavorscht.

After years of pestering from his wife Frida, local man Ben Wiebe of North Newton finally broke down and shaved his face this afternoon. The lawn, however, was left at a record height of two feet three inches.
“I finally broke down and shaved,” said Wiebe. “My wife was starting to withhold intimacy with me and my boss was leaving not-so-subtle hints that we about ready to do the same.”

“My boss didn’t really seem to care about my lawn, and my wife was split 50/50 on it,” said Wiebe. “So it was obvious that shaving was a priority.”
Wiebe’s lawn, which has been left unmowed for almost a month, has become a favourite spot for crows, rabbits, robins, and Canada geese.

“This 3-D printer is a miracle worker. You just type in a few numbers and out comes the zwieback!” said Klassen. “Sure, the schmuant fat tastes a little off, but it’s worth it for the independence it brings.”
After his divorce, Klassen said he planned to live in a basement suite in Clearbrook for the rest of his life, surrounded by his collection of Sears catalogues from the 1980s and Star Wars figurines that were still in their original packaging. He also plans to be surrounded by his own filth and loneliness.
“The 3-D printer has eliminated any need I ever had for female companionship,” said Klassen. “Quite frankly, I don’t think I’ll ever need to leave the house or put on a pair of pants anymore.”
The 3-D printer has been banned by many Mennonite churches who claim it can be used for a weapon to break up families.
“If they can 3-D print farmer sausage, soon all the Mr. Klassens and Mr. Pletts will be leaving their marriages and living in basement suites alone,” said Reverend Doug. “I mean, women will be leaving their husbands, too. With this machine, any Mennonite man can easily be replaced by just 3-D printing a big lazy wad of plastic and propping in on the couch.”
Reverend Doug preached an hour-long sermon warning against the new technology.
“The only thing holding our marriages together is the lack of 3-D printing,” said Reverend Doug. “We must not allow this new apparatus to destroy our way of life.”
The peculiar-coloured and odd-tasting faspa this Sunday led to rumours that it, too, had been 3-D printed, although others suggested it had just been Mrs. Dueck’s turn to be in charge and her faspa all “tastes a little suspect.”

‘Bigfoot’ Revealed to be a ‘Mr. Friesen’ from Altona,"ALTONA, MB
The mystery of Bigfoot has finally been solved! After careful analysis of the footage, scientists at Pembina Valley University, have concluded that the big hairy beast seen traipsing through the back-40 last year is “very likely just some Mr. Friesen from Altona.”
“The evidence is overwhelming,” said Dr. Toews. “I mean, all you have to do is turn up the volume and you’ll hear the creature speak in fluent Plautdietsch.”
While scientists don’t yet know precisely which Mr. Friesen from Altona it is, they are certain, by the volume of hair and vacant stare that “it must be a Friesen.”
“Some people are saying he looks a lot like one of the Kornelsens from Jantsied, but his accent is definitely a West Reserve accent!” said Dr. Toews. “Plus, I think he was the backup goalie for the Altona squad at the last EM Cup!”
Researchers are hoping to catch a glimpse of Mr. Friesen late this night. Friesen is known to wander down 2nd Street every night just after eleven. He is often seen without his shirt off, yelling Plautdietsch profanity into neighbourhood yards.
“If you spot Mr. Friesen, please give him his space,” said Dr. Toews. “Bigfoots prefer to avoid human contact…unless you’re bringing them watermelon.”
The local EMB church plans to put on a display of Bigfoot artifacts this summer, including a size 13 Nike footprint, a pile of knackzoat shells, and petrified Bigfoot dung found on Main Street.",NaN,"July 30, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bigfoot-e1532974462997.jpg?resize=395%2C222,Fake
How to Measure Your BMI (Body Mennonite Index),"The body mass index is used to measure a person’s relative health based on their weight and height. Unfortunately, the traditional BMI does not work for Mennonites. Instead, Mennonite doctors recommend that you use the Body Mennonite Index. Here’s how it works!
The length (in inches) of formavorscht you consume in a week
multiplied by:
your height (including black hat or bonnet) in inches
divided by:
the number of hours you spend cleaning the pig sty and/or kissing your cousin Bertha behind the barn (both are equally rigorous)

Discovery Channel’s Documentary on ‘Pacifist Sharks’ is ‘Most Boring’ Program Ever Aired During Shark Week,"MIAMI, FL
The Discovery Channel’s annual ‘Shark Week’ usually features numerous fascinating documentaries about the underwater killing machines, full of exciting decapitations and mutilations that keep audiences on the edge of their seats. This year, however, they decided to “shake things up a little bit,” by airing a two-hour long program on those rare sharks who have decided it’s “against their religion to kill.”
“Believe it or not, there are a small percentage of sharks who are Conscientious Objectors,” said Dr. Friesen. “They survive mostly by keeping a low profile, having large families, and nibbling on plankton.”
Scientists have been studying the peculiar behaviour of the pacifist sharks for quite some time. It’s believed they first started their non-violent ways sometime during the radical shark reformation of the 16th century.
“It’s a miracle they’ve survived as long as they have,” said Friesen. “Occasionally the younger sharks leave for the city and start killing seals and otters and all that. It really grieves the older, more traditional, pacifist sharks to see it….but what can you do?”
The episode on pacifist sharks, which consisted mostly of footage of them attending church and swimming around not doing much, was the lowest rated program during Shark Week.
“I sympathize with these sharks. They have a good point to make. But people want to be entertained,” said Dr. Friesen. “And I’m sorry to say, but pacifist sharks are about as interesting to watch as that goldfish in your tank at home.”
The Discovery Channel has promised more blood and guts next year, and vows never to air footage of pacifist sharks again.",NaN,"July 28, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shark-e1532813451247.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Blood Moon ‘A Sign From God’ that the Reign of the Fundamentalist Mennonite Elders Has Come to an End,"BERGTHAL, MB
Conservative Mennonites across North America are interpreting tonight’s blood moon as a ‘clear sign from God’ that they no longer have to follow the ‘bullshit rules’ of the elders and can now live life as they please.
“Finally! I’ve been waiting all my life for something like this,” said Peter Wiebe, drinking his first martini at the ripe old age of 73. “The elders can’t do anything to me now!”
The blood moon is being used to justify all sorts of more progressive interpretations of scripture, including the “radical” idea that women should have equal status in the church and all facets of Mennonite life.
“Blood moon or not, Mrs. Friesen is preaching this Sunday!” said one congregant, seen for the first time without her bonnet. “Oh, and I’m sitting where I darn well please, too.”
The blood moon also signals the end of the horse-and-buggy, mandatory evening services, and overly literal interpretations of the first two chapter of Genesis.
“Quite frankly, the blood moon is just an excuse,” said Wiebe. “We’ve been waiting for our chance to shake things up for quite the while now. Here’s our chance.”
Meanwhile, all the legalistic elders are proclaiming that the blood moon actually means a return to the old ways…but no one cares what they have to say anymore.",NaN,"July 27, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/moon-e1532724370297.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
"Mennonite Dog Breeder Creates New Breed, the ‘Low German Shepherd’","WINKLER, MB
Expert dog breeder, Mr. Peter Fehr, 59, of Winkler, has worked for more than three decades to create a new dog breed: the Low German Shepherd. Thanks to a lot of blood, sweat and tears, as well as the prayers of the entire Fehr clan, his hard work has finally paid off!
“Oba, well, I tried feeding his mother roll kuchen and platz, but all it did was make her fat yet,” said Fehr. “I found out the hard way dat the only ting what works is to take the mother to evening service for a year or so. Dan the puppies come out just right!”
The new puppies, who bark in fluent Plautdietsch, are the first of their kind, but Fehr promises they will not be the last.
“Jauma lied! There are peoples in Vankla who want a good Low German Shepherd yet,” said Fehr. “I can’t keep up with the demand.”
Instead of responding to usual commands like “stay,” “sit,” and “roll over,” the Low German Shepherd will only obey orders such as “bliewe,” “sette,” and “waut de schissjat!”
“My little hunt Pieta is very spashal to me,” said Fehr. “Nowadays Mr. Friesen and Corner Kornelsen and even the Petkau sisters have been coming to me and wanting to breed mit Pieta, but I just say no. Pieta, the Low German Shepherd, is not just breeding with anyone who shows a little interest yet!”
All the regular High German Shepherds were very sad to hear the news and held a meeting in the Lutheran church to decide what to do.
“That Plautdietsch dog is putting us regular German Shepherds out of work,” said Heinz, a well-loved puppy in the area. “I think it’s time we moved to the city!”
In other news, the Rottweilers and Dachshunds have petitioned the Winkler mayor to ban all attempts at breeding anymore Low German-speaking canines.

Mennonite Pastor Launches String of F-Bombs in Last Sermon Before Retirement,"REIMERSFELD, SK
Local Mennonite pastor, Reverend Schmidt, whose recent lotto-649 win has afforded him an early retirement, unleashed a string of f-bombs in his final sermon as head of East Reimersfeld Mennonite.
“He sure let us have it!” said one parishioner. “I can’t say we didn’t deserve it. I mean I’ve been quite the jackass this year with my meddling in the women’s ministry and all that. I just wish he had chosen a different set of vocabulary.”
The f-bomb attack was the largest use of violence by a Mennonite pastor since Reverend Heinrich Baerg joined the Selbstschutz back in the old country.
“Oba, I wanted to walk out after about forty minutes, but I’ve been taught all my life that a sermon lasts one hour and fifteen minutes and that it’s rude to leave early,” said Mrs. Loewen. “I really wish he hadn’t dropped so many f-bombs, but I guess it’s what we get for reducing his salary every year for the past decade.”
Schmidt has defended his actions saying that it’s everyone’s dream to quit their job like this.
“I’m sure everyone in my congregation wishes they could just go up to Abe at the concrete factory or Jim at the chicken barn and say ‘take this job and shove it,'” explained Schmidt. “Well, I finally got my chance.”

Fraser Valley Mennonites Put the ‘Before Christ’ in BC,"YARROW, BC
A new study out of the University of the Fraser Valley indicates that early Mennonite settlers may have been under the mistaken impression that ‘BC’ stood for ‘Before Christ’ when they decided to settle in the region.
“We’ve recently uncovered Plautdietsch documents that discuss the initial relocation of Mennonites from the Canadian prairies to BC,” explained professor Patricia Loewen. “They seemed to be under the impression everything in British Colombia was like something from the Stone Age. And that’s precisely what attracted them to the region.”
The attraction of moving to some place where everyone lived like it was thousands of years ago was found to be a significant draw to conservative Mennonites of the 1930s, who, to this day, still emulate their caveman ancestors.
“They were done with AD and everything that came with it,” said Loewen. “To them, Manitoba of the 1930s was just far too modern and worldly. BC was a much better option.”
In the years since, many Fraser Valley Mennonites have retained their original BC ways such as living in caves, eating raw meat, picking berries, and fishing for salmon.
“Mr. Friesen just came up with this new thing he called ‘the wheel,'” said local Mennonite Pete Wiebe. “But, oba nay, that doesn’t seem right to me. I thought we were living in BC here. If he wants to use a wheel he can move to Steinbach or something.”

Mennonite Woman’s Thumbs Got a Great Workout at the Gym Today,"STEINBACH, MB
Local woman Erin Friesen, 34, gave her thumbs quite the workout at the gym today. Friesen estimates she sent more than a hundred texts today and burned between 3 and 4 calories.
“Dang it feels good to get a good workout in,” said Friesen. “Usually I’m exhausted after twenty minutes, but today I could have worked out all day!”
Friesen made sure to spend the entire time sitting at the chest-fly machine without actually using it.
“It’s the best place to sit and text at the gym,” said Friesen. “Yesterday I sat and checked my emails on the leg press machine, but it just wasn’t the same.”
Friesen considers herself a “real gym rat” and claims to have some of the fittest thumbs in town.
“I see people in here all the time grunting and sweating and where are the results?” pondered Friesen. “Ain’t nobody got thumbs like these things!”

"Unsure if New Church Friend’s a Teetotaler, Mennonite Woman Invites Her for ‘Coffee’","STEINBACH, MB
Miss Liz Bergen, 29, had initially thought of asking her new friend Ashley from church to meet her at Sawney Bean’s pub for a pint of Guinness, but decided to play it safe this time and invite her to go for coffee instead.
“It’s always a risk when you meet someone at church,” said Liz. “Are they or aren’t they? It’s sometimes hard to tell.”
Liz and Ashley met in the lobby at church and immediately hit it off as they’re both fans of the TV show The Bachelor.
“I mean that’s a pretty good sign isn’t it?” said Liz. “But, you can never be too sure. I didn’t want to offend her.”
Liz said she’s been burned before when offering alcohol too soon and didn’t want to make that mistake twice.
“I had a really bad experience at a church small group wind-up party one time,” said Liz. “I hauled out the Smirnoff Ice bottles and everyone acted all shocked and offended and just drank tap water and diet President’s Choice cola.

Mennonites Compete to See Who Can Cook the Blandest Least Spicy Chili,"LEAMINGTON, ON
Mennonites across southern Ontario have gathered in Leamington this week for the annual MB-GC Chili Cook-Off. Returning to the competition is last year’s champion Mrs. Lehman of St. Jacob’s whose extra-bland zero-pepper chili delighted the judges.
“She’s a miracle worker with a bottle of ketchup and a can of tomatoes,” said head judge Mr. Fehr. “I mean, when you can make a chili as unspicy as Mrs. Lehman’s, it’s really difficult for the others to compete. How can you make it any blander?”
Mennonites have a notoriously low tolerance for spicy food, and the judges are always looking for a nice simple chili that consists entirely of unseasoned ground beef and a few kidney beans.
“Spicy food unnecessarily riles up the senses and gets people thinking unwholesome thoughts,” said Mr. Fehr. “It’s the same reason we ply our children with dry puffed wheat every morning.”
Mrs. Lehman is facing fierce competition this year from the Wiebe family of Mississauga who have been working on their recipe all year.
“I think we’ve got it down to the place where even Oma can tolerate it…although she did request to add a little sour cream to the last batch,” said Wiebe. “But after a few tweaks, we guarantee no one’s breaking out into a sweat with our Wiebe’s Secret Extra Mild Chili!”
The winner will be declared on Sunday after a sleep-inducing sermon by Pastor Dave.

Evolutionist Proves Mennonites are Descended from Abes,"DRUMHELLER, AB
Scientists at the Friesen Academy of Science, Platz, and Aniseed (FASPA) have uncovered conclusive evidence that proves the evolution of Mennonites from our ancestors the Abes.
“Sometime millions of years ago in the old country, the first Abe stood upright,” said Dr. Friesen. “If you examine the fossil evidence, it’s pretty clear that all Mennonites come from a common ancestor Abe.”
Dr. Friesen has recently completed his magnum opus, a 2000 page book entitled “The Descent of Mennonites,” which documents his findings about ancient Mennonite frintschoft in minute detail.
“We’ve got averybody in here. All the Friesens and Reimers and Platts, too. And all of them go back to the Abes,” said Friesen. “You can even see how the brains get smaller and smaller as you go back to the Abes.”
Despite his meticulous research, some members of the Mennonite community are not accepting Friesen’s theory as fact.
“Oba, that man has all these fossils, but I don’t know how he can tell if it’s an Abe or a Peter or a Jakob yet,” said Mr. Loewen. “I mean for all I know that fossil could be from Mrs. Annie Pankratz. Who knows for sure!”
Friesen says he has carbon dated all his fossils at least back to days of the East and West Reserve.

Hypnotist Claims to Remove Mennonite Schmaunt Fat Cravings,"WINNIPEG, MB
Mennonites flocked to the Days Inn in North Kildonan this week in hopes of eliminating their schmaunt fat cravings by a very unique method: hypnosis. Renowned American Mennonite hypnotist Nobrane has been charging $89.99 to remove unwanted cravings in suckers for years.
“It worked wonders,” said Peter Fehr of Winkler. “First they give you a gift certificate for the local Mennonite buffet. It’s all you can eat, so naturally I stuffed myself. Then Nobrane gets you to close your eyes and count to three and my schmaunt fat cravings are gone!”
There has been an increased demand for the service, since Pastor Jim’s latest sermon series on gluttony.
“Oba, I realized that all the things I considered pleasurable were actually a sin,” said Fehr. “Coffee, chatting in the church lobby, even schmaunt fat!”
Fehr also asked Nobrane to help him remove his desire to glance longingly at the women’s section in church.
“This hypnosis has really worked for me!” exclaimed Fehr. “I haven’t gone this long without schmaunt fat or staring at Martha Petkau in my entire life!”
Fehr reportedly went ten minutes before the cravings returned with a vengeance and he had to be re-hypnotised for another 90 bucks.

Hutterite Woman Rollerblades Her Way Into Mennonite Man’s Heart,"FRIENDLY ROAD COLONY, AB
Miss Rebecca Kleinsasser of Friendly Road Colony caught the attention of bachelor Peter Wiebe at the Dairy Queen in Taber this week. Wiebe was particularly enamoured by Kleinsasser’s pink rollerblades and ability to maneuver her way around the restaurant without dripping any of her chocolate chip cookie dough Blizzard on her dress.
“Oba, that’s the woman for me,” said Peter. “I knew it the moment I saw those pink rollerblades!”
There was some communication difficultly at first as Kleinsasser’s Hutterisch and Wiebe’s Plautdietsch are slightly different dialects. However, they were able to chat briefly in English and share a dilly bar before Rebecca’s older brother Jakob intervened.
“That man is not a Hutterite. I doubt he even knows how to rollerblade!” explained Jakob. “He’s got to make a lot of changes before he courts my sister! For starters, he can get himself a decent pair of suspenders…and stop shaving!”
Peter quickly explained that his hairless face had nothing to do with shaving and was just how it was in his family.
“Plus, I’m still a young man. I’ve got time for the beard to grow,” said Wiebe. “I don’t see why us Mennonites and Hutterites can’t come together.”
The courtship between a Hutterite and Mennonite is considered the most controversial relationship in southern Alberta since Widow Hofer married a man from the Dariusleut. A film entitled “Wherefore Art Thou, Peter Wiebe” is already in production.

Steinbach’s world famous water tower is getting a bit of an upgrade this fall with the addition of a 20 square foot glass bottom viewing area. The attraction, which is budgeted at just over $50 million, is generating a lot of excitement around town.
“I just can’t believe I’ll be able to go a few metres into the air and look out over the Friesen’s yard,” said Mr. Loewen. “Oba, this is going to be great.”
The cost of admission is $30 which is in line with other attractions of the type, such as the CN Tower in Toronto and the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur.
“I heard they’re even installing an elevator that takes you all the way up to the top floor in just under a minute,” said Mr. Loewen. “Either that or you can take the stairs and be there in about thirty seconds.”
The Steinbach Water Tower will also include an outdoor feature, where visitors will be strapped to the side of the tower with some old rope from Mr. Giesbrecht’s farmstead.
“It’ll be very exhilarating for thrill-seeking Steinbachers,” said Mr. Loewen. “I’ve seen the plans and they are amazing. I just hope they’ll do something just as exciting with the Steinbach windmill.”

Pastor Insists on Preaching Exclusively from The Authorized Kevin James Version Bible,"SASKATOON, SK
Pastor Ron of South Mennonite has been preaching the Word for close to two decades and despite pressure from some of the younger people to “get with the times” he has been adamant in his refusal to use anything but The Authorized Kevin James Version.
“Some people are using NIV and the Message and all that stuff,” said Pastor Ron, “but none of those were sent down from above like the KJV. I mean there are whole sections of the KJV that the NIV and others are missing.”
When asked to clarify, Pastor Ron pointed out an entire chapter of 2 Kings where the prophet Elijah is taken up into Heaven in a Segway and a few verses in the Gospel of Matthew where Jesus clears the money-changers out of a suburban shopping mall.
“The Kevin James Version was meticulously translated from the original Greek and Hebrew back around the time the first Paul Blart: Mall Cop movie came out,” explains Pastor Ron, “and ever since then it has held a sacred place in the hearts of many believers.”
Pastor Ron condemns those who use other versions of the Bible because, as he puts it, “they’re just not taking the Scriptures seriously enough.”
“I know there are some who find the language dated and difficult. A lot has changed since 2009,” said Pastor Ron. “But just because something is difficult doesn’t mean we should take the easy way out and switch to the New Kevin James Version or something.”

Recent Overdoses in Altona May Be Linked to Star Anise,"ALTONA, MB
Three Mennonite men have been released from Altona Hospital this past week following consumption of Aunt Bertha’s chicken noodle soup which police say may have been laced with excessive amounts of star anise.
“This star anise epidemic is no longer confined to East Hasting Street in Vancouver,” said Officer Froese. “We’re seeing more and more star anise pop up even in tightly-knit Mennonite communities like Altona.”
Police warn Mennonite grannies that there’s only so much anise that a person can take and caution home cooks to use restraint.
“We all like a bit of star anise in our chicken soup,” said Froese. “But we have to be careful. That stuff can be deadly if you overdo it.”
Experts say that it takes years for a Mennonite woman to learn how to use star anise.

Cold Reception in Church Lobby Sparks New Ice Age,"OMAHA, NE
The entire state of Nebraska slipped into a new ice age last Sunday after members of Omaha Community Mennonite did their usual thing of talking with their friends and half-heartedly welcoming newcomers. The particularly frosty reception triggered an entirely new climate that scientists predict could last up to 10,000 years.
“Wow, those Mennonites can be cold,” said climate scientist Dr. Agnes Smythe. “They just stick to themselves drinking coffee and complaining about the sermon. They’ll hardly even make eye contact with visitors.”
The ice age was thought to have started after the Jansen family from Kansas showed up for the first time last Sunday morning.
“They stood there for a full fifteen minutes before an usher reluctantly offered them a bulletin,” said Dr. Smythe. “Old Mr. Rempel may have glanced at them from the corner of his eye, but that’s about all they got.”
The Jansens stayed throughout the service and even stood around in the lobby afterwards, but still not a single member bothered to greet them.
“It’s really too bad they got such a cold reception and now we have to deal with this darn ice age for the next few millennia,” said Dr. Smythe. “I sure hope this ice age doesn’t spread to other states.”

Dozens of Mennonites Hired to ‘Drain the Swamp’ in Washington,"WASHINGTON, DC
After more than a year in office with little success working the rough soil of Washington, President Trump is now seeking new innovative measures to drain the swamp and has hired more than 100 experienced Mennonite farmers to do the job.
“They drained swamps from the Vistula Delta to the East Reserve and everywhere in between,” said Trump. “If they can’t drain the swamp in Washington, no one can.”
Mennonite crews were already active this morning building dykes and channelling water on the streets of Washington, DC.
“We’re going to make this city irrigable again,” said Mennonite farmer Richard Dyck. “You’ll see, before long they’ll be growing alfalfa as high as the Lincoln Memorial!”

Peter Dueck says sitting in his front lawn wearing gitch is more entertaining than what passes for television these days and hopes that others will join him.
“Ach, it’s too hot to wear slacks,” said Dueck. “Besides, I get a nice tan while watching the neighbours take out the garbage and cook their wieners.”
Although there have been some efforts to put an end to Dueck’s disturbing behaviour, local authorities say he hasn’t broken any laws.
“The right to knack zoat in your gitch is written right into the Schanzenbergenfeld town charter,” said Constable Penner. “I really wish he wouldn’t do it, but there’s nothing we can do but close our eyes.”
Dueck, on the other hand, is always keeping his eyes wide open in case anything interesting happens on his block, so he can report it to Mrs. Klassen over on Friesen Street who sits in her front lawn all day wearing nothing but a slip and brown nylons.",NaN,"July 14, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/man-1-e1527653250710.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Pair of Reimers Go Door-to-Door in Salt Lake City,"SALT LAKE CITY, UT
A couple of Reimers from Friesenschanzenfeld have decided to leave the farm behind and go door-to-door in Salt Lake City this summer.
“We’re hoping to recruit as many Mormons as possible,” said Reimer. “If not, then we’re at least hoping to wake them up real early on Saturday morning like they always do to me back home in Friesenschanzenfeld.”
Reimer said he got the idea after being rudely interrupted one Sunday during his afternoon meddachschlop.
“They ring the doorbell at 2:15 while Martha and I are having our weekly meddachschlop,” explained Reimer. “Let me tell you. It was not appreciated! I decided right then and there that I was going to do unto others as they’ve done unto me!”
On the Reimers very first outing they were met at the front door by a pair of Pentecostals, Evangelicals, Presbyterians, Baptists, and Lutherans, all of whom seem to have the same idea.
“Oba, now we’re all standing at the door and that poor Mormon family is going to have to choose,” said Reimer. “I made a pretty good case for switching to the Mennonite faith, but they’ve got to make their own decision.”
In the end the Mormon family decided to stay with their own religion, especially since all the other groups didn’t offer any fancy new holy books.",NaN,"July 13, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/couple-e1528935433922.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Local Man Lives Unnoticed in Megachurch Restroom for 10 Years,"WINNIPEG, MB
Custodial staff at Winnipeg megachurch, Waters of Blessing, were shocked to find a man in a state of undress curled up in the corner of the men’s room on Tuesday night.
“I found it strange that the same stall was always occupied,” said Peter Wheeler, head custodian at the church. “But what can I do? I like to give people their space when they’re on the can.”
Tommy Peters, who is now claiming squatters rights, says he first entered Waters of Blessing during a worship night back in 2007 and decided he would make the third stall in the downstairs men’s room his new home.
“Whenever someone would knock I would just say, ‘there’s someone in here,’ and they would apologize and run away,” said Peters. “Before the church, I used to live in the Legislative Building downtown. It works there, too.”
Peters says he sometimes peaks his head outside during the Sunday morning services, but for the most part is a homebody.
“They’ve got pretty good wi-fi here,” said Peters. “It’s not a very welcoming or observant church, but that’s probably because they’re distracted by the strobe lights.”
Peters plans to fight for his right to stay at Waters of Blessings in court.
“If I don’t win my case,” said Peters, “I’m going to try sneaking into the pastor’s office during a baptismal service. I hear he’s got a really nice restroom.”

Winnipeg Woman Spontaneously Combusts After Venturing Outside the Perimeter,"WINNIPEG, MB
Every Winnipegger’s biggest fear came true last night as one brave soul ventured outside the Perimeter and did not return. Set to become the first Winnipegger ever to leave the city limits to visit a friend, Ms. Peters, 21, of North Kildonan, vanished into a puff of smoke just a little before Deacon’s Corner.
“Oh, Diana, why, why!” said her distraught mother. “I told her never to drive to Steinbach. This is what happens! This is exactly what I warned her about!”
For centuries, scientists had debated the validity of claims of spontaneous combustion, but this time there is no debate.
“If you ever wanted proof of spontaneous combustion, look no further,” said Dr. Smithers. “We can now pinpoint the precise cause – and that is: visiting a friend in the country.”
Since the tragedy, huge signs have gone up on the edge of the city saying, “enter at your own risk,” though paranoid rural Manitobans have suggested the message should be placed on both sides of the sign.

Winkler Realtor Invites Nosy Mennonites to Wander Around the Friesen’s House,"WINKLER, MB
Dozens of Mennonite couples showed up at the Friesen home this past Sunday between 2:00 and 4:00 pm even though they had absolutely no intention of buying the place.
“We were just there to snoop around and check it out,” said Mrs. Fehr. “I mean those Friesens are pretty stingy on the invites.”
Winklerites were very impressed with the Friesen’s cleanliness, choice of floral wall paper, and generous use of crocheted Bible verse wall hangings.
“As soon as I saw that ‘As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord,’ hanging in the entrance, I knew these were good people,” said Mrs. Fehr. “Equally impressive was the painting of the old man praying.”
Mrs. Fehr said she shows up at Open Houses every weekend, even though she’s perfectly content living in her 55 plus condominium.
“When the realtor asks me if I have any questions, I just tell them I’m browsing,” said Mrs. Fehr. “I don’t want to lead anyone on, but sometimes my curiosity gets the better of me.”
The local used car dealer has also complained about the number of Winklerites taking a “test drive” that lasts all afternoon.

Mennonite Man Strip Searched at Airport; Security Shocked at What they Found!,"VANCOUVER, BC
Mr. Klassen of Yarrow, BC was selected for random screening at the Vancouver Airport this past week. Mr. Klassen had been heading to visit frintschoft in Kansas, when he was pulled aside for extra security.
“Normally the strip search is my favourite part of the job, but when I saw Mr. Abe Klassen saunter up, I was immediately taken aback,” said airport security worker Michael Doyle. “That was one man I certainly did not want to make drop his drawers…but it’s part of my job.”
After a pat down, full body scan and cavity search, airport security discovered a wide range of concealed items on Mr. Klassen’s person.
“That man has nooks and crannies like you wouldn’t believe,” said Doyle. “In one large crevice in his lower back I discovered a yerba mate gourd, an unopened can of Rogers Golden syrup, and some suspicious-looking herbs in a plastic bag that Mr. Klassen claimed were essential for making something called ‘zumma borscht.'”
Klassen said he enjoyed the strip search well enough, but has some advice for the Vancouver Airport security.
“Whenever my Annie is giving me a sponge bath, I yust say, ‘go for it, Anna, oba yet!'” explained Klassen. “I think these Englishers are a little too delicate.”
Klassen said they didn’t find half the stuff he had hidden, but won’t disclose what the items are or where he had them hidden.
“My cousins in Kansas didn’t seem to mind,” said Klassen. “What they don’t know won’t hurt them.”

Revolutionary New Mennonite Church Adds an Extra Two Ounces to Baptismal Water,"WINKLER, MB
A new Mennonite church — in reality a breakaway from the old one — plans to revolutionize the way Mennonites do baptism by pouring an extra two ounces of water during the baptism.
“Our pastor is a young man, fresh out of Bible School, with a lot of innovative ideas,” said elder Henry. “For all my years the volume of water was determined by the size of the mason jars, but now we’ve got newer bigger mason jars! We’re gonna put all the other Mennonite churches in town out of business with these things.”
Meanwhile the old, more conservative churches, are sticking to the traditional volume of water.
“The amount of water to be used in a baptism is very specifically outlined in the Scriptures… somewhere…” explained Pastor Thomas. “You can’t mess with tradition like that. What if the baptism doesn’t count?”
The older Mennonite churches are also warning the new church about “over-baptism.”
“If you use too much water, it might negate the original baptism,” said Pastor Thomas. “You certainly wouldn’t want to get to the Pearly Gates and find out you can’t get in on account of having used a bit too much water.”
Elder Henry, on the other hand, from the new Mennonite church says he doesn’t want to risk not getting in on account of having used too little.",NaN,"July 9, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/water-e1512856963935.jpg?resize=636%2C358,Fake
Dozens Injured in Annual Pilgrimage to Mennonite Landing Spot,"NIVERVILLE, MB
More than thirty Mennonite pilgrims were injured this past week as they gathered for the annual pilgrimage to the spot on the Red River where their ancestors first landed in the 1870s. The spot, near modern day Niverville, is known as ‘Mennonite Landing’ and is treasured as much for its prime fishing as it is for its historic importance to Russian Mennonite refugees.
“We had pilgrims, preachers, historians and fishermen,” explained horrified witness Agnes Plett. “It was a huddled mass of Mennonites all crammed in among the trees clamouring for a spot near the commemorative cairn.”
Some Mennonites believe that if they touch the commemorative cairn it can bring healing and prosperity.
“The problem is there’s only so much cairn to go around,” said Plett. “I really wish people would distribute their visits more evenly throughout the year.”
Despite the injuries, which sent dozens of Mennonites to the hospital, many pilgrims still believe in the power of the cairn.
“I was trampled trying to touch the sacred cairn, but thanks to the cairn’s healing power I am alive today,” said survivor Art Neufeld of New Bothwell.
Local fisherman also believe that touching the cairn brings good luck and extra-large catfish.",NaN,"July 9, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_1728-e1504743964600.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Visitor to Winkler Gets Severe Case of Mennozuma’s Revenge,"WINKLER, MB
Failing to heed the warnings not to drink the water, Mr. Peters of Steinbach was left with a severe case of what he described as “stomach problems” after a recent visit to Winkler.
“I knew I should have had that Dukoral,” said Mr. Peters. “When you visit a foreign country like Yantsied, you can never be too careful. Us Ditsieders are just not used to their water.”
Travellers who fail to take precautions are often beset with illness when crossing the Red River to the other Mennonite colonies. In fact, Mennozuma’s Revenge also affects visitors to Steinbach from foreign lands such as Altona or Rosenort.
“I always warn travellers to make sure they’re up-to-date with their vaccinations,” said Dr. Neufeld. “Yantsieders have different germs that can really do a number on Ditsieders if you’re not careful.”
Mr. Peters eventually recovered from his illness, but not until he had plenty of bedrest and drank two full bottles of Pepto-Bismol.

Grand Beach Declared ‘Urine Free Zone’,"GRAND BEACH, MB
Urinating at Manitoba’s most popular Lake Winnipeg beach this summer will result in stiff penalties thanks to a new law. Grand Beach is now officially ‘Urine Free,’ although smoking and drinking is still permitted.
“We thought it was time to clean up Grand Beach,” said Manitoba Beach Administrator Dale Daleson. “Too many families with urinating babies and European men in speedos. Something had to be done.”
As of July 1, the entirety of the 24,000 square kilometre surface area of Lake Winnipeg will be doused with a secret dye that turns bright blue when it comes into contact with urine.
“It will be very embarrassing for a lot of swimmers…not to mention a few fish,” said Daleson. “But that’s just the price you pay if you urinate in Lake Winnipeg!”
Environmentalists have praised the new law, saying that now all they have to do is convince Manitoba’s largest corporations to stop dumping their garbage in the lake.

Conservative and Liberal Mennonite Debate Church Music,"Let’s face it. Religious and political discourse is in serious decline these days. People prefer sound bites and memes to intelligent well-argued dialogue. In an effort to elevate the conversation, the Daily Bonnet has arranged this debate between a liberal and conservative Mennonite on the topic of church music. To represent the liberal position, we have Bethany Friesen of Peace Mennonite Church in Winnipeg. On the conservative side, we have Peter Wall of the Reinland Old Colony Church. Thanks for joining us!
The Daily Bonnet: Thanks Bethany and Peter for coming. Today we’re going to discuss church music. So, Peter, start us off. What do you think a worship service look like?
Peter: Oba, well, I think it should be just like in the old days before our churches were corrupted by all this modern thinking. Why change it if it ain’t broke?
Bethany: Hmmm….you’re entitled to your opinion, of course, Peter, but I really think churches should adapt with the times and not be stuck in the past.
The Daily Bonnet: Well, it seems like you’re pretty far apart on this issue.
Peter: Oba yo, but what do you expect? I’m a Bible believing Christian, not some liberal Mennonite from the city!
Bethany: Yeah, you can’t expect a sophisticated university-educated woman like myself to have anything in common with a rube like him. No offence, Peter.
Peter: None taken. I’m proud to be a rube.
The Daily Bonnet: So what, specifically, do you think a worship service should consist of?
Peter: Oba, that’s easy. A brief sermon. An offering. A few hymns. As they say, if it was good enough for the Mennonites in Molotschna, it’s good enough for me.
Bethany: Wait a minute, Peter. You’re into hymns?
Peter: Of course. Always have been.
Bethany: Hymns are the hottest thing right now.
Peter: Really? Will wonders never cease?!
Bethany: They just don’t write songs like they used to. Nothing beats 606 and 4-part harmony.
Peter: You’re right there, Bethany. Ach, too many churches with drums and electric guitar these days. That’s just too weltjlich!
Bethany: What you’re saying really resonates with me…
Peter: I don’t know what that means. Sounds like hippie talk to me.
Bethany: It means I agree with you. Church should not be for entertainment.
Peter: Agreed. What are your thoughts on responsive readings?
Bethany: Love them! I’m totally down with a good responsive reading every now and then. They’re all the rage these days.
Peter: Are they? Well, we’ve been doing them out in Reinland forever.
Bethany: Are you sure you’re conservative? Your church sounds pretty hip.
Peter: You like hymns and responsive readings. Are you sure you’re a liberal?
Bethany: Yeah, hymns are great! So much better than the modern repetitive worship songs created by large multinational corporations.
Peter: Yeah, those modern songs have no place in church. Nothing but hymns for me!
Bethany: Totally! Nothing but hymns.
Peter: Great! See you Sunday?
Bethany: I’ll be there.
Peter: You’ll have to sit in the women’s section.
Bethany: Oh, $&@!

‘Citizen Krahn’ Voted ‘Greatest Movie of All Time’,"LA CRETE, AB
Movie experts in the small northern Alberta town of La Crete have overwhelmingly voted Orson Wiebe’s 1941 classic ‘Citizen Krahn’ as the ‘Greatest Film of All Time.’ The film tells the tale of Charles Foster Krahn, a lowly Mennonite chicken catcher, who strikes it rich in the hog farming business and eventually runs for Premier of Alberta.
“It’s a tale that a lot of La Crete people can relate to,” said Mr. Peters, who teaches film history at the local community centre/roll kuchen factory. “It’s a fictional film, but rumour has it it’s based on the life of renowned Mennonite billionaire William Randolph Hiebert!”
When the film was first released in 1941, Hiebert vehemently opposed the film, even offering the producers seventeen buckets of freshly picked blueberries if they’d destroy the negatives.
“Director Orson Wiebe refused the offer,” explains Peters, “and praise the Lord he did, because we’ve been left with this marvelous gift of a film. It’s the first ever film to use ‘Dietschlaund’ as a swear word.”
A special screening of ‘Citizen Krahn’ will be held at the local Co-op cardlock this Friday.
“I hope everyone appreciates the story and the marvelous cinematography by none other than our own Mrs. Froese!” said Peters. “It’s really innovative stuff. She was the first Mennonite woman permitted by the elders to hold a camera in her hands.”

Singing hymns through the night, but our church was still there.

Naive Young Man Still Clinging to Hope of Meeting Eligible Young Woman in Church,"ALTONA, MB
Local bachelor Timothy Wiebe, 23, of Altona is sticking to his guns and showing up to church every Sunday hoping and praying that a young woman his age will miraculously appear. Wiebe has been an active member of West Altona EMB since he was a child, but is starting to lose his patience.
“Don’t get me wrong, I love seniors,” said Wiebe. “But just once I’d love to see a hipster girl in skinny jeans sit across the aisle from me and pass the offering plate.”
Wiebe is West Altona’s token young person, and the seniors are desperate to keep him around.
“I keep telling him, ‘Oh, don’t you worry, Timothy. Someday your princess will come. Just wait and see what the Lord has in store for you!” said Mrs. Klassen. “I’m not really so optimistic, but I want to keep him attending our church. He’s the only one who knows how to operate the overhead projector.”
Occasionally Mrs. Klassen will invite her grand-daughter Bethany to church, just to give young Timothy some hope.

Local Man Dies of Boredom Watching Soccer,"KITCHENER, ON
Local man Mr. Gingrich, 73, of Kitchener passed away peacefully in his sleep yesterday. He was discovered by his daughter Samantha, who found him on the couch with a World Cup match still playing on the television set.
“I really wish he made better choices in life. I guess for some reason he decided he’d try watching soccer,” said Ms. Gingrich. “He’s used to hockey and Canadian football, so I can see why he never woke up. It’s too bad, really.”
The match was tied 0-0 when Samantha walked in the door to find her father.
“There ought to be one of those content warnings before the match begins,” said Ms. Gingrich. “It can be really shocking, all that passing and passing and nothing ever happening. It’s hard on the old ticker.”

Canada Day Ruined as Stoned Singer Totally Butchers ‘Oh Canada’,"OTTAWA, ON
Thousands gathered in Ottawa today to celebrate the nation’s birthday. However, more than a few people, including one of the anthem singers, were in the city to celebrate a little more than just yet another Canada Day.
“Quite frankly, it was more like Woodstock than Canada Day,” said one observer who asked to be called Moonfish. “Everyone was strung out and the anthem singer stopped right in the middle of ‘O Canada’ with an uncontrollable fit of the giggles. Oh, well, I guess that’s just the way it is from now on.”
In addition to the giggling fit, the stoned version of ‘O Canada’ also included snippets of Jefferson Airplane lyrics and a guitar solo by some guy trying to be Hendrix.
“I’ve never heard anyone weave ‘one pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small’ into the anthem before,” said Moonfish. “I think it works!”

Mennonite Man Fakes Injury to Avoid Church this Morning,"MENNO COLONY, PARAGUAY
Guillermo Toews, 26, of Menno Colony went down with an injury early this morning, but slo-motion replay shows he’s “clearly just faking it to avoid going to church.”
“We’ve seen this kind of thing before. They ‘twist an ankle’ feeding the cows, or ‘pull a muscle’ sweeping out the hog sty,” said Bishop Friesen. “It’s a good thing we have instant replay or these young Mennonite men would be getting away with everything!”
Guillermo Toews is pleading his innocence, though his friends say he’s been ‘watching an awful lot of soccer lately.’
“He’s been getting ideas from the World Cup,” said Johan Penner. “All you’ve got to do is writhe around on the grass and you can skip the rest of the match. It works the same with church.”
Guillermo Toews received a Yellow Card from the elder board for “unMennolike conduct,” which means he can’t sit with the rest of the congregation during faspa this afternoon.
“It’s a harsh punishment. I hate to see my friend being banished to the children’s table,” said Penner. “He was so close to getting together with Maria Kornelson, but after this incident, his chances are very slim.”
In addition to being in a drafty corner of the church basement, the children’s and unbaptized sinner’s table features a limited number of pickles and just one yerba mate gourd to be shared with everyone.

School’s Out! Back-to-School Shopping Begins!,"CALGARY, AB
Just seconds after Calgary students were released for summer vacation, advertisers began pestering their parents to begin their back-to-school shopping.
“Pencils, binders, backpacks, and all the latest fashions. We’ve got it all,” said one local store. “You don’t want to miss out on all our amazing back-to-school specials on right now!”
The back-to-school shopping season is beginning earlier and earlier every year and that is creating some distress for area students.
“Ugh, they don’t even let us enjoy July without thinking about school,” said little Timmy. “Mom’s already dragging me to Walmart three days next week!”
Next year, local retailers are hoping to start the back-to-school season sometime in late April.
“We’d start even sooner if we could, but we don’t want to compete with Christmas,” said a local store manager. “As far as I’m concerned it’s always back-to-school!”

Canadian Country Singer Successfully Fakes Southern Accent for Over a Decade,"TABER, AB
Country music superstar Belinda Ray Wheeler, stage name of Taber woman Amanda Peters, has been drawing huge crowds at barn dances and small town fairs for over a decade with her own unique brand of country pop music. Wheeler can boot-scoot like nobody’s business, but the real attraction is her incredible ability to mimic a southern American accent.
“She fakes that accent like no one else,” said megafan Mrs. Friesen. “She even says ‘ya’ll’ once in a while, which really makes the whole experience extra special and authentic.”
Wheeler’s most well-known song was her 2010 hit, “Dirty Pickup Trucks,” which she belts out with the best fake southern drawl this side of the 49th parallel.
“For years I thought she was from Tennessee,” said Mrs. Friesen. “As it turns out she’s from just outside Lethbridge, but whatever. As long as she pretends to be something she isn’t, that’s all that matters as far as I’m concerned.”

Military Called In to Prevent Mennonite Woman from Getting Behind the Pulpit,"ASHLAND, PA
The National Guard were rushed into a small Pennsylvania church this past Sunday after a Mennonite woman attempted to get behind the pulpit and elucidate the audience on the Book of 2 Peter. Not knowing what to do, the elders scrambled to call in the authorities.
“We don’t really have a contingency plan for this sort of thing,” said Elder Miller. “It’s never happened before and it never occurred to us that it would. For centuries, our philosophy has been that it’s much better to hear a sermon from a vastly undereducated human being with a pair of XY chromosomes than an intelligent, well-informed, and eloquent human being with two X chromosomes!”
Mrs. Horst was ten minutes into her sermon before the military arrived and shut things down.
“Quite frankly, we’re not really sure why we’re here,” said Lt. Dawson. “But when a Mennonite elder calls us, we just show up, no questions asked.”
Mrs. Horst was detained on charges of disrupting the peaceful ignorance of the elders and an obscure law called “making a man look like a fool.” She was released three days later and spoke to reporters.
“I encourage other Mennonite women to do this. Just go on up there,” said Miller. “The great thing is, as pacifists, there’s really not much the elders can do. They can’t physically get in your way. They have to let you talk.”
A source in the U.S. military, who did not want to be named, told us they would no longer intervene in such cases and thus Mennonite women, “have absolutely nothing to lose and might as well smash the patriarchy.”

A List of Better Secular Alternatives to Wholesome Christian Rock Bands,"Growing up as a Mennonite kid, and one who attended a private Christian school in the 1990s, I’ve had more than my fair share of inferior Christian rock thrust upon me against my will. Back in the olden days when people still bought CDs (instead of the more modern and hip technology of vinyl records), Christian bands were often marketed as wholesome equivalents to popular secular artists. And back in those days, we all deluded ourselves into thinking this largely lousy music was actually good quality. I’ve decided to revisit this idea and offer musical recommendations.

We Need Your Help to Solve This Mennonite Mystery at the Museum (This is real),"Just yesterday, Brenda Suderman, renowned Winnipeg writer and quilt expert, was in Halifax, Nova Scotia at the Canadian Museum of Immigration. Well, one exhibit asked visitors to reflect on their own family history and immigration story. The board asked the question: “What are some of the customs and traditions that you take part in?”
Brenda quickly added her two cents: “Knipsbrat and knackzoat” she wrote and added it to the wall. Then, lo and behold, she noticed the paper right below her’s. “Faspa and spaziering.” (Light lunch and chatting). Ha. Ha! For real!

So, here’s where we need your help. These notes are not signed, and I assume the museum takes them down every day or so. So, let’s see if we can use the power of the Internet to figure out who wrote that second message.
Know any Russian Mennonites (those who might be familiar with faspa and spaziering) who’ve been in Halifax lately, specifically at the Canadian Museum of Immigration? Maybe it’s you! I’m confident we can solve this mystery!
Also, a couple photos of Mennonites at this museum.
Thanks, Brenda!

"Now that Grandma’s Passed, the Hieberts Can Finally Stop Having So Many Family Gatherings","LINDEN, AB
Although nothing has been officially decided, it’s quite clear from the sense of relief that has swept over the Hiebert clan, that we won’t be having another Hiebert gathering anytime soon. Now that Grandma’s gone the Hieberts feel there isn’t really any reason to get together anymore.
“We were only having gatherings because she liked to see us all together as a family,” said Carol Hiebert, 42. “If one good thing has come out of Mom’s passing, it’s that I won’t have to see my obnoxious cousin Jake and his family nearly so often.”
While Mom was still alive, the Hieberts were compelled to gather for Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, as well as a few collective birthday parties scattered throughout the year and a torturous weekend at the lake every summer.
“I’m sure glad that’s all over with now,” said Carol. “I could never be myself around those people. I was forcing myself to smile just to make Grandma happy. I always had to put on my Hiebert face.”
While a few Hieberts are still clinging to the possibility of at least having a Christmas gathering sometime in early December or late January, so far no one has committed to coming.
“I ain’t guaranteeing anything. We’ll see how it goes,” said Carol. “But I think I’m probably in Cancun or something that weekend.”
Now that Grandma’s gone, many of the Hieberts have also been relieved from the heavy burden of having to show up to church once in a while.",NaN,"June 26, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/grandma-e1519706195707.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Area Man’s Fingers Permanently Stained By Ketchup Chips,"MISSISSAUGA, ON
Local man Peter Lehman, 39, of Mississauga has been left permanently disfigured this week after eating ketchup chips. According to Lehman, after an hourlong session during which time he ate two bags of ketchup chips and watched three episodes of Last Man Standing, his fingertips were left with dark red stains which no amount of soap and water could remove.
“Soap, detergent, vigorous scrubbing – nothing worked!” exclaimed Lehman. “I had my hands under the taps for an hour shouting ‘Out, out, damned spot,’ but nothing worked!”
While recovering at an area hospital, Lehman is petitioning the Canadian government to require warning labels on bags of ketchup chips.
“Something has got to be done about this! You can lick your fingers, but that only embeds the ketchup stain even more,” said Lehman. “I mean, it’s embarassing. I’ve been leaving little red marks over everything. You don’t want to see my keyboard.”
So far, Health Canada officials have not responded to Lehman’s request, though Lehman is considering getting lawyers involved.
“Look at my fingers! Just look at them!” said Lehman. “What woman will want to date me with fingers like this!”
After fives days with ketchup stained fingers, Lehman is slowly getting used to his new life, and has promised to stick to Cheetos from now on.",NaN,"June 25, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/chips-e1529036156816.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
"Pastor’s Wife Wears ‘I Really Don’t Care, Do You?’ Jacket to Church","AKRON, PA
Mrs. Melanie Troyer, 43, wife of Reverend Dilbert Troyer, showed up to church this morning sporting a “I Really Don’t Care, Do You?” jacket that she purchased online at Zara. The Troyers were quick to say it meant “absolutely nothing,” though that didn’t stop the local media from suggesting otherwise.
“I know Mrs. Troyer and she doesn’t just toss on any old thing without it meaning something,” said local Mennonite news anchor Peter Stoltzfus. “I think she’s sending a message to the Mennonite church.”
While some are suggesting it’s all just a coincidence, it should be noted that Reverend Troyer’s message this morning was on wives submitting to their husbands, in which, like usual, he conveniently left out all those verses about husbands laying down their lives for their wives.
“Quite frankly, I think she should wear that jacket more often,” said church member Mrs. Kauffmann. “I’m thinking of getting one myself!”
The church quilting club is also planning on sewing a huge “I Really Don’t Care, Do You?” quilt and displaying it prominently in the church foyer.
“Our message is this: get rid of all your stupid legalistic rules and made-up traditions or you’ll see a lot more quilts and jackets like this,” said Mrs. Kauffmann. “I really don’t care what the elders have to say, do you?”",NaN,"June 24, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-24-at-3.29.11-PM-e1529872315139.png?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonite Woman Catfishes Dozens of Men With Notes in Church Mailboxes,"ST. JACOB’S, ON
Catfishing, an online scam using false identities to win people’s trust for financial gain, has become a huge problem in recent years, with people across the globe falling prey. So far Mennonite communities have been safe from the scam, since they all ban the Internet. That is, until now. Just last week St Jacob’s police arrested Mrs. Martha Horst on suspicion of catfishing more than a dozen men by leaving sweet little notes in their church mailboxes.
“I got this note from a mysterious ‘Mrs. Wenger,'” said Mr. Gingrich. “Well, I don’t know any Mrs. Wengers. I know a Weaver and a Weber and a few Witmers, but absolutely no Wengers. Anyway, she said she had seen me in the lobby and was dying to meet me. I was intrigued. As it turns out, all she wanted was my Social Insurance Number and my debit card.”
Mr. Gingrich is just one of dozens of men who’ve been duped by Mrs. Horst’s notes.
“One day there was a letter in the mailbox from a young woman in her 60s – or so she said,” explained Mr. Bender. “She asked if we could be pen pals and I said, sure, why not. It lasted for months. Whenever I’d ask her to meet me at Mary’s Zwieback Schack, she’d always come up with some excuse. I began to get suspicious…”
The catfishing scam went on for a full year before St. Jacob’s police finally caught their suspect.
“She messed up when she used the name Helen Reimer,” said the Officer. “There ain’t no Russian Mennonites around these parts. When you catfish in St. Jacob’s, you better catfish Swiss style!”

New Bombers Quarterback Inspired By Patrik Laine’s Mennonite Beard,"WINNIPEG, MB
Rookie Winnipeg Blue Bombers quarterback Chris Streveler filled in for an injured Matt Nichols on Friday night and led the team to a 56-10 rout over the Montreal Alouettes. As notable as his fantastic play at pivot, was Streveler’s facial hair, which bore an eery resemblance to another young Winnipeg phenom.
“I spent a lot of time with the Hutterites in South Dakota,” said Streveler. “So that was one inspiration. The other was Patrik Laine. If it worked for him, I figured it might work for me.”
Mennonite-inspired facial hair seems to be taking Manitoba by storm as of late, and commentators are speculating whether it might be more than just a silly superstition.
“They always said of Michael Jordan that it must be the shoes,” said TSN analyst Milt Stegall. “Well, I’m beginning to think it must be the straggly Mennonite beard. There’s simply no other explanation.”
Other rookies across the CFL are desperately growing out their beards, but it’s unlikely they’ll have a full and thick authentic Mennonite beard until late in the season.
“Streveler’s a smart guy. He planned ahead and grew his beard out long ago,” said Stegall. “Heck, if I had known about this beard thing I might have won a Grey Cup myself.”
Streveler expressed some misgivings about playing for a team called the “Bombers” but, before signing, the team assured him that it was “just a name” and that pacifist Anabaptists were more than welcome on the team.",NaN,"June 23, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_0597-e1529787637250.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Quiz: Is it a sin or is it NOT a sin?,"Let’s face it, a lot of the stuff the elders claimed was sinful was just made up at a board meeting back in the 1960s sometime. Still, if you’ve been raised in a strict Mennonite environment, it’s not always easy to tell what is an actual commandment of God and what’s just something made up by the elders. So, let’s see how well you do.
I know this is a contentious term, but for the purposes of this quiz, we’re defining “sin” as something expressly forbidden in the Bible. So, yeah, you’re trying to answer which of these things are actually forbidden in the Bible, and which are just B.S. from the elder board.

Plastic Straw Ban Leaves Pacifist Mennonites Completely Defenceless,"BERNE, IN
In recent weeks, cities across the country have banned plastic straws because of their environmental impact. While many are supportive of the idea, there has been some resistance, particularly from the nation’s 500,000 Mennonites, who see the ban on plastic straws as an infringement on their Second Amendment rights.
“We’re pacifists, so we don’t have many means to defend ourselves like the rest of society,” said Elder Funk of Berne, Indiana. “We can’t use guns or knives or other weapons. But every Mennonite home is well equipped with plastic straws and spitballs. It’s all we have!”
Funk has already taken his case to the Indiana state Supreme Court in Indianapolis, where a ruling on the matter is expected later this week.
“Plastic straws are all we have to defend our homes and our families,” said Funk. “We started using them sometime in the 1950s after a local church committee scoured the Bible and couldn’t find a single admonition not to use them.”
Funk says that young Mennonite boys practice hurling spitballs starting at about age 12.
“We even have a class on it in our private schools,” said Funk. “Well, technically it’s Math class, but you know how things go.”
Not only is the plastic straw and spitball every Mennonite’s most sacred weapon, but it’s also used in Anabaptist courting rituals as well.
“There’s a six in ten chance that the Yoder girl you struck in the back of the neck with a spitball in eighth grade will one day be your wife,” explained Funk. “I’m not sure how our Mennonite communities would function without these plastic straws.”
Funk is confident the court will see things his way, but the Mennonites of Indiana have already been pursuing other options just in case. Alternative options include paper straws or reusable straws made of steel, and early testing at Sunday School this weekend suggests they just might do the trick.

Government Needs Your Help in Tracking Down Family of Asylum Seekers Who Crossed the Border Late Last Night,"NATIONAL BORDER REGION
The federal government is seeking the public’s help in tracking down a family of undocumented migrants who are believed to have crossed the border into the country in the middle of the night. Authorities describe the suspects as “a working class family of three,” and, “foreign in appearance.”
“We believe they crossed through a remote part of the desert,” said one government official. “We’re asking the public to keep an eye out for them, so that these criminals can be brought to justice.”
While some people might think that a young blue collar couple and their baby are more-or-less harmless, the government is urging locals to keep their distance and call the police as soon as you see them.
“These foreigners need to brought to trial and returned to their home country,” said the government spokesperson. “I understand they may be facing some trouble in their own country – death, starvation, religious persecution – but we have rules and procedures that must be followed. You can’t just have people crossing any time they please.”
Authorities are confident the family will be caught. When caught the parents will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The infant son’s fate is yet to be determined.
“The public is really scared of these people, and rightfully so. They’re a threat to our national security and need to be sent back home immediately.”

Mennonites Caught Smuggling Dirty Rubber Boots Across the Border,"WINDSOR, ON
A Canadian Mennonite family has been detained at the Windsor-Detroit border this afternoon after the Canadian border officer spotted Mr. Friesen’s dirty rubber boots and suspected their might be a problem.
“How long have you had those manure-caked rubber boots?” said the officer. “Oh, and those suspenders looks awfully suspicious, too.”
In recent days, Canadians have been accused of smuggling footwear back into the country using a wide variety of sneaky tactics.
“The dirtier they are, the more I get suspicious,” said the officer. “These Canadian Mennonites will do anything to get their hands on a pair of cheap American shit kickers.”
Mr. Friesen insisted he’d always had those boots, though the officer decided to take him in for questioning anyway.
“They tested them like crazy yet,” said Mr. Friesen. “I told them I also had a pair of tighty-whities they might want to have a look at, but they didn’t seem that interested in them.”
Since they had no conclusive evidence, Mr. Friesen was let go with a warning, though just moments later an entire minivan full of Driedgers from Leamington were arrested and fined for wearing Crocs that looked suspiciously new.

"24 Hours Later, Dad is Still Going Back for “Just One More Plate”","STEINBACH, MB
Sunday, June 17 was the 2018 Manitoba Marathon, an event where Mennonite dads compete to see who can make the most return visits to refill their plates with vereniki and schmaunt fat at the Mennonite Heritage Village buffet. 2018’s winner was Mr. Billy Funk, 58, who was still at it Monday morning.
“They tried to turn the lights off and tell me it was time to leave, but I just kept on going,” said Mr. Funk. “Jauma, these people make some good vereniki!”
Funk made more than eighty return visits to the buffet table and was still going strong when museum employees showed up to work this morning.
“He’s got remarkable stamina, let me tell you,” said museum director Barney Dueck. “He’s really making sure he gets his money’s worth.”

The MB church in the tiny Mennonite village of Kleinschantz has been awarded their very own Chicken Chef franchise, which will begin operation in the church basement this fall.
“Oba, our vary own Shackan Shaf yat!” said a visibly excited Pastor Dave. “Finally we won’t have to rely solely on Mr. Platt’s sporadic tithing to keep the lights on.”

“With golfball-ball sized hail like that, how else can I protect my investment but by making sure my ’98 Caravan is out there in the weather?” said Mr. Schmidt. “You don’t get many opportunities like this!”

As an extra precaution, Schmidt, himself, stood naked in the storm hoping to be struck by lightning.

2018 FIFA Mennonite World Cup Rankings,"MOSCOW, RUSSIA
FIFA has announced its final rankings just before the 2018 Mennonite World Cup in Russia. Some of these rankings have us a little baffled. Let’s have a look.
1) Russia  – Some have been shocked to find Russia number one on the list, especially since there are very few Mennonites left in the country. Pundits have suggested that perhaps the voting was influenced by pro-Russian memes on Facebook. I guess we’ll never know.
2) Belize – Mr. Friesen of Shipyard Colony will have to sit out the first game of the tournament due to a red card he received for improperly milking a neighbour’s cow last week. The Belize team is strong, but without Mr. Friesen they are not number one.
3) Brazil – The Curitiba Kleine Gemeinde Men’s church league team dominated play over rival MB and General Conference teams to earn their way into the FIFA Mennonite World Cup. Rumour has it the MB and GCers had a few two many caipirinhas at the time of the match.
4) Ethiopia – This is the first year Team Ethiopia has made it to the FIFA Mennonite finals. With a 6 to nil victory over the United States in the hymn singing competition, Team Ethiopia is one of this year’s top contenders.
5) Mexico – Strong contenders from Chihuahua dominated last year’s knackzoat competition, but have been known for their soccer abilities as well. Opponents will have to avoid Mrs. Penner’s hot sauce if they want to stand a chance.
6) India – The Mennonite team from India got a confidence boost in 2017 after dominating the Mennonite cricket competition last year, during which time they spent teaching all the other Mennonites the rules of the game. They look to parlay this confidence into a FIFA victory this June.
7) Germany – The only High German-speaking team will have to brush up on their Plautdietsch if they wish to stand a chance, especially since all the officials are coming from Yantsied.
8) Paraguay – The Paraguay Mennonite Men’s team is used to playing in the hot Chaco sun, so with a more temperate Russian summer climate, the team may see an increase in goal production. Not much we can do about their dairy production, though, as Russia refuses to let the cows into the country.
9) The Netherlands – The Dutch team has done well in the regular Englisher World Cup, but will need to lay off the pot if they want to come out victorious in the Mennonite competition. Team Canada faces the same obstacle.
10) Bolivia – Team Bolivia defeated Team Uruguay to qualify for the FIFA Mennonite World Cup this year. Team Uruguay is still rather upset about it and refuses to sing 4-part harmony with any Bolivians until the matter is settled.
11) Switzerland- Much like their cheese, there are plenty of holes in the Swiss defence. However, they stand a chance if they can convince Stephane Chapuisat to come out of retirement and be re-baptized.
12) United States of America – Team USA is made up mostly of liberal Mennonites from around near Goshen somewhere. The horse-and-buggy Mennonites from Pennsylvania are known for their ball-kicking abilities, but refused to play when they found out the games would be televised.
13 – 199) All the other countries….Every other country in the world, even ones without any Mennonites like, say, Tuvalu and Iceland, rank somewhere between number 13 and the lowly Canadians.
200) Canada – The presence of a few Mexican Mennonite boys from Taber was not enough to dig Team Canada’s Mennonite soccer team from the very bottom of the world rankings. However, the Canadians dominate Mennonite floor hockey tournaments.

Impromptu Worship Service Breaks Out in Hobby Lobby,"GRAND FORKS, ND
More than three hundred shoppers spontaneously broke out into song last Saturday at the Hobby Lobby in Grand Forks.
“I was just minding my own business looking at the wide array of delightful card stock in the paper crafts section,” explained Ellen Froese of Winnipeg, “when all of a sudden ‘Reckless Love’ came on in the background and I just had to sing out!”
At first, Froese hummed faintly under her breath, but when she noticed the woman next to her was also singing, she got the courage to sing a little louder.
“Soon they were praising the Lord in the yarn and needle art section,” recalled Froese. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”
The service was capped off by a particularly moving sermon by Pastor Jim of North Kildonan, who just happened to be browsing the home decor aisle.
“I’ve always got sermon notes and a PowerPoint ready to go,” said Pastor Jim. “You just never know when a bunch of strangers at Hobby Lobby want 40 minutes of insight into the first three chapters of Romans.”
The manager at the Grand Forks Hobby Lobby, however, said this phenomenon was not all that unusual.
“This happens every time the Mennonites come down here for a shopping trip,” said Hobby Lobby manager Thomas. “I mean, this is nothing – you should see what happens at Chick-fil-A.”

Local Man Unfollows Satire Site After One Too Many Trump Posts,"VANCOUVER, BC
Local man Paul Johnson, 22, announced his unfollowing of a popular satire site after being deeply and personally offended by a satirical article about the current President of the United States Donald Trump.
“As soon as I saw that post about Donald Trump I sent a private message informing the site that I was no longer following it. That’ll teach them for going after the leader of the free world,” said a still angry Johnson. “I’m not easily angered, but even the slightest criticism of Donald Trump really gets my goat.”
Johnson has been a huge fan of Donald Trump since his inauguration and therefore cannot tolerate any criticism of The Donald whatsoever.
“It’s blasphemy! If you insult Trump, you’re violating my religious freedom or something like that,” said Johnson on a recent blog post. “Not only am I offended at previous posts poking fun at Trump, but I’m just as offended at this article you are reading right now!”
Johnson then spent the rest of the evening commenting on how easily liberals are “triggered.”",NaN,"June 12, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anger-e1520052583466.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Trump Demands Russian Mennonites Be Included in G7,"LA MALBAIE, QC
As the nation’s largest economies met in Quebec this week to discuss ways to further their stranglehold on the globe, there was one group that was notably absent: The Russian Mennonites. According to U.S. President Donald Trump, “it’s a complete waste of time to have these meetings without the Russian Mennonites.”
“Added altogether they’re the world’s fifth largest economy,” said Trump, who did not cite his sources. “Their farms, church pew factories and credit unions are remarkable, just remarkable!”
Trump also cited the Russian Mennonites swamp-draining ability as quite the asset.
“I mean that’s why I was sent to Washington in the first place, wasn’t it? To drain the swamp?” said Trump. “I think these Russian Mennonites would do wonders in these meetings. Plus, they could provide faspa.”
There was also some talk of inviting the Swiss Mennonites to join, but no one was confident they would understand the language.

Trudeau Won’t Play Nice; Trump Needs Diaper Change,"LA MALBAIE, QC
Child care workers hired for the G7 summit in Quebec this week took on more work than they had bargained for as a fight broke out between a couple infants in the sand box on Sunday afternoon.
“I’m not sure what went on, but you know how children are. Trudeau wasn’t playing nice and Trump started crying,” explained Mrs. Dubois. “Needless to say, after that we had more than a few nappies to change.”
Dubois says the sand needed to be replaced completely and the entire area was roped off until it could be properly sanitized.
“From now on, we’re not inviting babies to the G7,” said Dubois. “I think Angela Merkel and Shinzo Abe can come and sit here, but these North Americans are evidently not mature enough to play with the others!”
Little Trump was reportedly so upset at the situation, that he got his good friend Larry to make mean comments about Trudeau’s eternal destiny. (Theologians later responded by saying “there is absolutely no reason to believe that an individual’s, especially an infant’s, position on trade issues will determine their entry into Heaven and/or Hell.”)

New Horse-and-Buggy Dealership Opens in ‘Automobile City’,"STEINBACH, MB
There was a time when Steinbach was so conservative that springs in the carriage seat were considered worldly and the railway was moved 8 miles out of town so the sinners couldn’t get too close. So, it comes as a shock for some people to find out that Steinbach is actually the automobile capital of Manitoba. Today, however, Steinbach returns to the traditions of the past with the opening of the first horse-and-buggy dealership on Main Street since old Mr. Loewen’s shop closed in 1993.
“We really need to shake this ‘Automobile City’ image,” said new buggy dealer Mr. Plett. “We’re really disrupting the market with our amazing new horses and/or buggies.”
Plett and Sons Buggies and Horses celebrated its grand opening on Saturday, while many local Mennonite families traded in their minivans for buggies.
“I’m glad the churches are on board with this,” said Plett. “I saw a real boom in sales after the most influential pastor in town preached a 5-part sermon series against combustable engines.”
Plett is hoping the local auto dealers will follow suit and join him in selling horses and buggies.
“Some could just sell horses, others could just sell buggies, it wouldn’t matter,” said Plett. “As long as they aren’t selling Broncos and Mustangs we should be fine.”
The cruisers on Main Street have already made the switch, much to the relief of anyone trying to take a nice peaceful walk through the heart of Steinbach.

Mennonite Woman Permanently Stuck in Downward Dog,"ABBOTSFORD, BC
Local woman and novice yoga practitioner Sarah Martens, 31, was unable to get herself out of the downward dog position at class last week. After an hour of trying to maneuver herself into a normal position, Martens gave up and decided to just live the rest of her life in downward dog.
“Ugh, I know they always say don’t eat platz before doing yoga,” said Martens. “I guess I should have taken those warnings more seriously.”
Martens’ new life in downward dog has caused her some difficulty in operating a motor vehicle, but she says it’s actually been a benefit for leading worship on Sundays.
“I’ve never heard such wonderful 4-part harmony,” said Martens. “I was able to reach notes I didn’t know were possible. Plus, everyone’s much more attentive than they were before.”
Martens also teaches Sunday School and says, despite some mild teasing at first, the kids were perfect angels.
“They all understand my condition,” said Martens. “Mennonite children are remarkable well-behaved.”
The children were especially excited to cover her in blankets and use Miss Martens as a tent. While she has been able to stay on as a Sunday School teacher, it’s not yet known if she’ll be able to continue as ladies faspa co-ordinator.

"Mennonite Woman Watches ‘Black Panther’, Can’t Figure Out Which One Is Peter Sellers","LANCASTER, PA
Local woman Dorothy Yoder, 68, was very excited to sit down with her husband Earl this past Friday and watch ‘Black Panther’ on DVD, but says, although she thoroughly enjoyed the film, she was left a little confused.
“I used to watch these movies all the time in the 70s,” said Mrs. Yoder. “I’m really glad they’re making them again, but I still wonder, though, ‘which one is Peter Sellers?'”
Yoder says that other than the absence of Mr. Sellers, however, the film is more or less just as she expected.
“I knew they were going to change a few things, like how they’re not looking for diamonds, but instead something called ‘vibranium,'” observed Yoder. “I think the film was great, but a few scenes with Inspector Clouseau would have made it a true masterpiece!”
Yoder was also disappointed that the new film completely left out the classic theme song by Henry Mancini.
“I just love that song,” says Mrs. Yoder. “I used to hum it loudly all the time in church until the pastor told me to keep quiet while he was praying.”

Manitoba Man Takes His Mexican Cousin to ‘Authentic Hole-in-the-Wall’,"WINKLER, MB
Unlike their counterparts in the United States and Canada, the Mennonites of Mexico don’t get what the big deal is about fast food Americanized tacos. Waldemar Krahn, for example, came up to Manitoba to visit relatives over the holidays, and was taken by enthusiastic Canadian cousins to “this great authentic Mexican hole-in-the wall I know about.”
“They said I was going to love it. That it would be just like being back home,” recalled Krahn. “I must say I was a little disappointed, though. Cheddar cheese? Hard shells? Oh, come on yet!”
While North American Mennonites love to wolf down a basket of Mexi-fries and a Doctor Pepper, their relatives in Mexico gasp in horror at the sight of such feeble imitations of Mexican food.
“You call this hot sauce?” said Krahn. “In the Bustillos Valley, this wouldn’t even qualify as mild.”
Krahn noted that back home good Mexican food is cooked in the open air on a plow disc, not in a strip mall beside a dollar store.
“Since this so-called Mexican food isn’t cutting it, I guess I’ll just go with some KFC,” said Krahn…who soon regretted that decision as well.",NaN,"June 8, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tacotime-e1512857069123.jpg?resize=500%2C281,Fake
Vegas Knights to Fold and Be Replaced With Massive ‘Game of Thrones’ Show,"LAS VEGAS, NV
After just one year in Sin City, the Vegas Knights have decided to hang up their skates and focus on something they’re good at: Game of Thrones themed pre-game shows.
“I just found that hockey wasn’t cutting it for me. All that ice, all that skating, all that passing. Oh, and that little puck that you can hardly see,” said Vegas owner Bill Fogey III. “I’m much more interested in staging elaborate shows with smoke machines and strobe lights and a guy dressed in armour who comes out and chops people’s heads off. So much better than hockey!”
The Vegas Knights arena will be retrofit over the summer to accommodate more than three hundred horse stalls and a $200 million laser light show.
“We’ve got George R.R. Martin signed on as General Manager next year,” said Fogey III. “I don’t want to give out any spoilers, but it’s going to be a show like nothing you’ve ever seen before.”
The current Vegas Knights players will be given the option of returning to their original teams, or being hired on as Dead Body #42 for the new show.
“I sure hope the Penguins will take me back,” said Marc-Andre Fleury, “because I just don’t know how long I can lie on the ground with fake blood on my chest and pretend to be dead.”
All three actual hockey fans in Las Vegas were very disappointed with the decision.

"Mennonite Author Writes Autobiography, Calls it a “Novel”","HOCHFELD, MB
Legendary Mennonite author Jakob Dyck, 74, has made a career out of writing thinly veiled autobiographies and his latest novel Ice Cream Pails Full of Pain is no exception.
“They say you should write about what you know,” said Dyck. “Well, I know old Mr. Reimer from down the street and nosy Mrs. Plett at church and that simple Mr. Klassen from out by Plum Coulee. The novel practically writes itself.”
Dyck’s reputation for “writing about what he knows” has caused considerable anxiety for residents in his home town of Hochfeld.
“People get nervous around me. They’re always wondering if something they do or say might appear in one of my novels,” said Dyck. “Well, they have good reason to feel this way. Where do you think I get all my ideas?”
Dyck’s most famous literary creation is a wise-cracking Mennonite boy name Johan Dueck, who lives in the small farming town of Reinfeld, where he milks cows and lusts after Maria Petkau. Dyck admits there are some parallels to his own life.
“What can I say? I led a pretty exciting life as a young lad. Might as well write about it,” said Dyck. “Plus, I come from the long-standing Mennonite literary tradition. It’s well known that every single Mennonite novel ever written is just autobiography with changed names.”

Local Church Adds Cake-Baking to List of Holy Sacraments,"DENVER, CO
A small church just outside of Denver, Colorado has voted overwhelmingly to add cake-baking to its list of holy sacraments. Starting this July, church members will be required to participate in baptism, communion, foot-washing, and the baking of small cakes with pink frosting.
“There is nothing more sacred to our faith in 21st century America than the baking of cakes,” said Reverend Miller. “How else could we possibly bare witness to the love and grace of our Lord without these precious precious cakes?”
The church, which never had a high regard for seminary-educated pastors to begin with, is now requiring future pastors to be educated exclusively in cake-baking.
“We’ve also got a cake discipleship program for new believers,” said Miller. “Oh, and no more Wednesday evening prayer meetings. From now on it’s all cake-baking, all the time!”
In a solemn service this Sunday, baptized members in good standing will be baking a giant Black Forest gateau, while the Sunday School kids will be making a delicious Bienenstich.
“Everyone is welcome to attend,” said Miller, “but please be respectful of our deep and serious religious practice.”

Local Baker Has Long List of People He Refuses to Bake Cakes For,"FRESNO, CA
Thousands of people have flocked to local baker Jakob Stauffer’s bakery in Fresno and gazed into the window at his delectable creations. Although many have seen his cakes, not a single person has been granted the privilege of trying a piece, as Stauffer has strict eligibility requirements that, so far, no one has been able to pass.
“According to the Supreme Court, I’m fully in my rights to put customers through a rigorous set of tests to determine their worthiness for cake and/or pie-purchasing,” explained Stauffer. “If I let you eat my cake it’s like I’m actively condoning anything you’ve ever done in your entire life. That’s why I play it safe and go by the clear biblical teaching: ‘None is righteous. No not one.”
Stauffer says he’s had a lot of interest in his cakes but has yet to find anyone righteous enough to purchase one. He then provided a long list of people he refuses to bake cakes for, which includes:
Stauffer says the list is not complete and reserves the right to deny cake to anyone.
“For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God,” he says, followed quickly by a loud and forceful, “no cake for you!”

"Mennonite Man Keeps Fork, Dessert Doesn’t Come","GOESSEL, KS
Local man Peter Wiebe was left sitting there with a fork in his hand for a full hour before he realized dessert simply wasn’t on its way.
“I even licked it off so the schmaunt fat and sausage residue wouldn’t taint the platz,” said Wiebe. “But, alas, there was no platz. I feel like a fool.”
Wiebe had learned through years of experience to keep his fork after Sunday dinner because dessert always followed, but apparently Mrs. Wiebe felt Peter needed to cut back a little.
“He can sit there with a fork in his hand for as long as he wants, it won’t change the fact he needs to lose forty pounds,” said Mrs. Wiebe. “Oh, and licking it doesn’t help. He still isn’t getting any dessert.”
Wiebe tried everything to make the dessert appear – squeezing the fork, grasping it with two hands, waving it around like a magic wand – but no matter what he did, the dessert never arrived.
“This is the most disappointing fork-keeping experience I’ve ever had,” said Wiebe. “To be honest, I’m a little traumatized. I’ve lost all faith in fork-keeping.”
Wiebe also learned the hard way that cleaning off your plate does not guarantee the arrival of seconds.

One-‘N’-Bergmans to Battle Two-‘N’-Bergmanns This Sunday Afternoon at Altona Park,"ALTONA, MB
Bergman(n)s across Southern Manitoba will duke it out this Sunday at Altona Memorial Park. The competition, which consists mostly of feats of strength and Plautdietsch spelling, will decide once and for all how the name is to be spelled.
“It’s time we showed those Two-N-Bergmans a thing or two about redundant letters!” said Peter Bergman of Gnadenfeld. “The Devil’s got a hold of those people, taking a perfectly good name like Bergman and adding an extra N.”

Mennonites Excited for Latest Instalment in the ‘Harder Boys’ Series,"BLUE CREEK COLONY, BELIZE
Mennonites are lining up outside bookstores throughout Belize in anticipation of the new Harder Boys adventure. The books, now numbering several hundred, features wholesome brothers Johnny and Abram Harder who solve mysteries in the various Mennonite colonies of Central America.
“Oba, yo, those Harder Boys get into quite the situations yet,” said series author Franklin W. Doerksen. “We’ve got ‘The Secret of Mrs. Loewen’s Duak’, ‘The Secret of the Plett Barn’, ‘The Secret of Mr. Reimer’s Suspenders’, and ‘The Secret of the Missing Hymnals.'”
In each book the Harder Boys, who reside in one of the nation’s more conservative colonies, manage to solve mysteries without the use of any modern technology whatsoever.
“You’d be amazed what you can do with a good horse, a sharpened pencil, and a little ingenuity,” said Doerksen. “The Harder Boys are truly an inspirational pair!”
Doerksen claims that even after writing more than 200 novels, he never has any trouble coming up with new ideas for Harder Boys books.
“In one of my upcoming books, Johnny is looking all over for his parents after church. He’s quite distraught and recruits Abram to help him solve the mystery. Eventually they discover the door to their parent’s bedroom is locked. How will they get the door open?” said Doerksen. “Well, I’ll let you read it for yourself. That one’s called ‘The Secret of the Sunday Afternoon Meddachschlop.'”
The publisher, based in Blue Creek Colony, is also considering a series about a crime-solving Mennonite girl in a flower dress named Nancy Dueck.

Canadian Government Spends $4.5 Billion on Old Useless Crap From Mrs. Penner’s Garage Sale,"OTTAWA, ON
The Canadian government announced Tuesday that it would be spending more than four billion dollars of taxpayer money on purchasing “whatever useless crap those Mennonites have for sale at their garage sales this weekend.” Of particular interest was all the junk Mrs. Penner’s been trying to get rid of since the 1960s.
“I know it’s a whole lot of garbage that Mrs. Penner’s abandoned, but that doesn’t mean it’s not of grave economic importance to the stability of our country,” said Mr. Morneau. “We can’t just let all her chipped teacups, Fortrel pants, and old Eatons catalogues be purchased by just anyone.”
The government will be sending out representatives to Mennonite towns across the country this week, with a focus on snatching up the useless crap that no one else seems to be buying.
“We’ve got to keep these garage sales going,” said Mr. Morneau. “We can’t count on the private sector to prop up these Mennonite ladies. Sometimes the government needs to step up and take some initiative…. Oh, look, used margarine containers!”
After hearing the government announcement, millions of Canadian Mennonites scrambled to get all their old worn out Chesterfields onto their front lawns ready for sale.

Jordan Peterson Refuses to Use God’s Preferred Pronouns,"TORONTO, ON
Controversial University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson has been become infamous in his efforts to battle so-called “political correctness,” and has resolutely refused to use the preferred pronouns of many individuals, including, apparently, God.
“I’m sick and tired of God’s refusal to state a gender,” said Peterson. “All this ‘thee, thy, thou’ nonsense in the King James Bible is absolutely ridiculous. It’s unnatural.”
Peterson, a clinical psychologist by training, dogmatically believes in binary gender, including for the Christian deity.
“Either God’s a man or a woman. There’s no other way to look at it,” said Peterson. “I don’t need the PC police to tell me ‘Oh, God’s neither male nor female!’ Come on! Make a decision for once!”
Peterson says he will never give in to the Creator of the Universe’s decision to remain gender neutral and will spend the rest of his life trying to assign God a gender.
“Everyone must fit into my tiny little box,” said Peterson, “and God is no exception.”
After the news became public, Peterson received debate invitations from every theologian alive.

While differences of opinion have continued to plague relations between the Unraus and Schellenbergs, there is hope that intervention by the United States could help smooth things over.
“In the past we’ve seen nothing but good things when the Americans get involved,” said Fast. “President Reagan helped tear down the College Avenue wall, while President Nixon smoothed over tensions between the North Kleefelders and hostile forces in New Bothwell.”

Mennonites Shun Patrik Laine For Shaving Off His Beard,"TAMPERE, FINLAND
After a playoff run that ended in disaster against the Vegas Knights, Winnipeg Jets superstar Patrik Laine has left the Mennonite faith and decided to shave off his beard and toss his suspenders in the trash. As a result, Mennonite elders have voted overwhelmingly to shun the young Finnish athlete.
“Obviously this Mennonite beard thing doesn’t work,” said a frustrated Laine. “I was told growing out my beard would provide me with some mystical Mennonite hockey powers, but it sure didn’t work against Vegas.”
Mennonites have long-believed that beards give them strength, like Samson, but local theologians are now seriously questioning this doctrine.
“I don’t know what went wrong. He had the beard. They should have won the cup,” said Reverend Neufeld. “It worked for Jonathan Toews on numerous occasions.”
Mennonites across Manitoba are now forbidden from eating at the same table as Patrik Laine. They are also forbidden from attending Jets games on a Sunday or allowing one of their daughters to marry him.

Quilt Cartel Jacks Up Prices at Mennonite Relief Sale,"NEW HAMBURG, ON
According to sources, a group of Mennonite ladies from southern Ontario have banded together to control the supply of quilts into the region. The cartel, known as the Ontario Producers of Elaborate Quilts (OPEQ), has been accused of setting the price of quilts artificially high.
“They’re pretty shifty, those quilting ladies,” said Bloomberg Business news commentator Maria Wall. “They’ve got all these quilts and they’re just sitting on them and driving up the price.”
As a result of OPEQ’s activities, the price of quilts at the MCC Relief Sale soared to records highs.
“I’ve never seen prices like this before,” said Wall. “I mean, the prices are so high, I’ve switched from premium unleaded quilts to just regular.”
The OPEQ producers also control the price of doilies, afghans and knitted hangers.
“It’s unfortunate, but what else can we do?” wondered Wall. “If you want a quilt, you’ve got to cough up the dough.”
Later in the day, Wall retracted all her comments and said she was “completely embarrassed” with herself, when she found out all the money went to a good cause.

Mennonite Man Caught “Enjoying Hot Wings” at Hooters,"MISHAWAKA, IN
Local man Andreas Miller, 51, was spotted on social media in the background of a photo taken at the local Hooters restaurant. The photo was immediately brought to the attention of the pastor, who demanded an explanation.
“Just because I’m on the elder board, doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy the hospitality and cuisine at Hooters,” said Miller in his defence. “There’s nothing in the Bible that forbids the consumption of chicken wings.”
Miller claimed that Hooters was a family restaurant and just because it’s mostly full of pervy middle-aged men doesn’t mean his presence there should be viewed with suspicion.
“Sometimes I go there after work to catch up on my devotions and have a few hot wings,” said Miller. “In all the Scriptures, Old and New, there’s not one single mention of Hooters. Not even once!”
Miller’s wife Beatrice said she had suspected Andreas was sneaking a few chicken wings on the side.
“He hasn’t been asking for seconds lately,” said Mrs. Miller. “And he’s really skimping on dessert.”
Still, Mr. Miller insisted his Hooters visits are on the up-and-up and, after an impassioned speech, managed to convince the elder board to hold their meetings at Hooters from now on.

Heintje to Perform at Faspa this Sunday,"ALTONA, MB
After repeated requests from his Mennonite fans in southern Manitoba, Dutch recording star Heintje is set to perform at faspa this Sunday. Mrs. Bueckert, chairperson of the Altona Heintje Appreciation Society, was especially excited about the news.
“I’ve been listening to Heintje since the 60s,” said Mrs. Bueckert. “When everyone else was into the Stones and the Beatles, us Mennonites were all about Heintje! He was such a good role model for our young people. If only my daughter Carol had married someone more like him instead of that Anglican fellow from the city.”
While Mrs. Bueckert’s fantasies of having Heintje as a son-in-law never came to fruition, she is certain that all will be well when she finally sees him perform live in concert.
“Heintje never ages. In my mind he’s perpetually 12 years old,” said Mrs. Bueckert. “At the faspa, I plan to just close my eyes, pop a few sugar cubes into my mouth, and imagine the innocent young lad I remember all those years ago singing ‘Mama.'”
After the announcement was made, the Altona MCC Thrift Store, which normally has a huge selection of Heintje LPs, quickly sold out of every album they had in stock.
“All we have left is a few Nana Mouskari records,” said the store manager. “Oh, and, of course, our world-renowned collection of Englebert Humperdinck.”
Mrs. Bueckert agreed to this interview provided we linked to her favourite Heintje song, “Oma so lieb.”

ABC Launches New Sitcom ‘Morden Family’,"MORDEN, MB
Television executives at ABC just announced a new cutting edge sitcom entitled ‘Morden Family,’ which explores the lives of several Mennonite families in Morden, Manitoba learning their place in an ever changing world.
“The plot revolves around a grumpy old church elder named Jay Plett and his vivacious Mexican Mennonite wife Gertie,” explained the show’s creator Lloyd Friesen. “It’s an ensemble cast showing the full range of diversity in our region from EMCers and MBers to Sommerfelders and Reinlanders and even some GCs.”
Friesen says he intends for ‘Morden Family’ to really tackle the compelling issues of the day such as Sunday shopping, who grows the best corn and/or apples and which of the more than two dozen local Chicken Chef restaurants is the best.
“In the first episode the Plett family argues about whether to go to Schanzenfeld or Friedenruh for the holidays,” said Friesen. “It gets pretty heated, but I’m glad we’re able to show such a range of perspectives on the issue.”
This is the first time a major US television network has featured Mennonites in such a prominent position, although some have said the Beverly Hillbillies and Dukes of Hazard were “inspired” by southern Manitoba Mennonite life.",NaN,"May 22, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mordenfamily-e1527007911123.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Entire Mennonite Town Becomes One Giant Escape Room,"NEUSCHANZENSCHULTZ, MB
The small Mennonite village of Neuschanzenschultz, Manitoba has inadvertently become the world’s largest escape room after years of ostracizing and shunning any resident who steps out of line or thinks for themselves.
“They make it very difficult to ever leave,” said one local, who wished to remain anonymous. “You do your own thing or break their rules, and they’ll cut you off, never speak to you again. With those kind of consequences, most people just suck it up and go along with whatever the elders say.”
Even trips to the city for supplies are strictly controlled and closely monitored by church authorities. The town is so hard to escape, that thrill seekers from across North America have been flocking to the community just to get their chance to escape it.
“I’ve heard this is one really rough escape room,” said eager escape room addict Dylan Penner from the city. “As soon as we heard about this place, my CMU friends and I decided to hop into the Saab and head on down to southern Manitoba. We hope to try our hands at escaping Neuschanzenschultz later this week!”
The only person to successfully escape Neuschanzenschultz was Dietrich Wiebe back in 1923, who left his relatives behind and fled to Paraguay.
“In all these years, we’ve only had one escapee,” said Elder Schultz. “Young Dietrich may have escaped, but not without consequences, let me tell you!”
Fortunately for the eager CMU students, Neuschanzenschultz is just as hard to join as it to escape. Their application to enter the town was immediately rejected as soon as the elders took one look at their “totally inappropriate” jean shorts.",NaN,"May 22, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/church-1-e1526870750215.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Manitoba Hockey Fan Emerges from House for the First Time in Many Months,"NIVERVILLE, MB
Local hockey fan Peter Klassen, 48, left his house for very first time in months, after the Winnipeg Jets lost to the Vegas Golden Nights on Sunday afternoon.
“Ach, the light, the bright bright light!” exclaimed a bewildered Klassen, who has not been exposed to sunlight since mid-November. “Somebody help me. Help me please!”
Klassen was rushed to the local hospital where we was treated for rickets and injected with fifteen vials of vitamin D.
“It seems Mr. Klassen has been surviving on pop tarts and living in squalor for months,” said Dr. Marshall. “This is what happens when your team goes so deep into the playoffs. We haven’t seen this before in Manitoba, but other cities are quite adept at handling this kind of condition.”
Klassen went into shock at the sight of green grass and warm weather and was immediately taken into intensive care.
“We’re hopeful he can be rehabilitated,” said the doctor, “but he may require extensive physiotherapy and will probably have to wear dark sunglasses for quite a while.”
Dr. Marshall was also worried about Klassen’s personal hygiene after observing that the patient had been wearing the same pair of Jets-branded underwear since sometime in January.",NaN,"May 21, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hockeyfan-e1526857037965.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Bettman Throws Massive Street Party to Celebrate Last Canadian Team Being Eliminated from Playoffs,"NEW YORK, NY
There was champagne flowing at NHL headquarters in New York City today, as long time NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman spared no expense in celebrating the fact that, once again, only American teams remain in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
“That was a little close for comfort, but we made it!” said Bettman, popping the cork on a bottle of vintage Dom Perignon. “Normally we don’t even like to have Canadian teams in the conference finals.”
Thousands of old men in suits who hate money but love money, were seen storming the streets surrounding NHL headquarters to celebrate the victory.
“It’s a great feeling…” said Bettman, narrowing dodging a bucket of Gatorade being dumped on him by his underlings. “After my first year as NHL commissioner back in 1993, not a single Canadian team has won the Stanley Cup since, and I intend to keep it that way!”

Mennonite Man Checks His Privilege Only to Have It Lost By American Airlines,"HARRISONBURG, VA
After attending a public lecture on intersectionality and white privilege at Eastern Mennonite University this past week, local man Peter Schrock decided to put what he learned in action and check his privilege on the flight back to Elkhart. Unfortunately for Schrock, the airline mistakenly sent his privilege, along with three T-shirts and a change of underwear, to somewhere in South America.
“This is the last time I check my privilege with American Airlines. They always get it wrong!” said Schrock. “I’m sure glad I’ve got an extra supply of privilege at home or I’d really be in a bind.”
Schrock says he wasn’t aware of all the benefits he received from being a straight, white, Christian male before, but really wishes he hadn’t thrown such valuable privilege in with a week’s worth of dirty laundry.
“Ugh. Not only did they lose my checked privilege, but I also had a $50 gift certificate for the Olive Garden in there,” said Schrock. “I demand to be compensated for my loss!”
Schrock is an elder on the local church board, but plans to step down and let a woman take his place until American Airlines returns his privilege to him. He also says he’ll never check his privilege again and plans to fly carry-on from now on.

Scrabble Tiles Found in Mennonite Woman’s Crown Royal Bag,"STEINBACH, MB
Mrs. Friesen nearly faced the firing squad at the elder board meeting this past week after it was reported she had been seen earlier in the week with a Crown Royal bag. The bag was immediately seized by the Steinbach Vice Squad and brought as evidence in her hearing with the church board.
“Nah, taunte! She just waltzed into the women’s ministry meeting with that Crown Royal bag!” said a noticeably distraught Mr. Wiens. “We’ve excommunicated more than our share of backslidden Mennonites for carrying that devilish purple bag with the convenient drawstrings!”
The Crown Royal bag was marked as Exhibit A in Mrs. Friesen’s trial and went under the close examination of the elder board.
“Oba, I didn’t even want to open it,” said Mr. Wiens. “But I finally mustered my courage and rutched my hand inside there…and what did I find? Scrabble tiles yet!”
The Scrabble tiles did not fully satisfy the elder board, however, as they still wanted to know how Mrs. Friesen obtained the Crown Royal bag in the first place.
“The MCC store of course,” explained Mrs. Friesen. “To be honest, I had no idea what ‘Crown Royal’ is. I still don’t.”
Mrs. Friesen also explained that she and other women at West Steinbach Mennonite use Crown Royal bags for Rummikub and dominos tiles as well.

Mennonite Woman Begins Each Morning with Devotions and the Daily Bonnet,"MORDEN, MB
Church-going local woman Brenda Claasen begins each morning with the reading of a Psalm and a Daily Bonnet article or two.
“It’s become part of my morning routine. I brew myself a cup of fair trade coffee from Ten Thousand Villages, read Romans 1, and then cleanse my palate with a couple Daily Bonnet articles,” said Claasen. “They’re not always funny, but they remind me of my childhood.”
Claasen is planning to petition her local Mennonite church to absolve her sins and obligation to teach Sunday School if she promises to keep up this ritual.
“By now it’s a sacrament: foot-washing, Welch’s, and a few minutes reading Mennonite satire,” said Claasen. “It makes up for the fact I don’t spell my surname correctly.”
Claasen plans to continue this ritual until the day the Lord blesses her with a husband.
“I’ve been reading Daniel and the Daily Bonnet for months now,” said Claasen. “If I don’t snag myself a Peter Friesen, I’ll be very disappointed.”
There were no Peter Friesens in church that Sunday.

Unmarried Couple Caught Holding Hymnal Together,"FRESNO, CA
An unmarried couple at South Fresno Mennonite are facing intense scrutiny after they were caught grasping opposite corners of the same hymnal during a rousing rendition of ‘Blessed Assurance’ this past Sunday. The church takes such matters of fornication very seriously and has called upon the couple to explain themselves.
“Hymnals before marriage is a very serious offence,” said Elder Johan. “It’s bad enough that we let them sit near each other, but now they’re even singing from the same hymn book? Disgusting!”
One of the accused, Miss Helena Fehr, 20, said she never intended to grasp hold of Peter Funk’s hymnal, but when he saw her looking around for a book, he offered to share his.
“I don’t know what came over me. I just reached out and grabbed the edge of his hymnal,” said Fehr. “He didn’t seem to mind. He didn’t pull away or anything, so we just sang like that with our hands on the same hymnal until the end of all five verses.”
After hearing her teary confession, the elder board has decided to absolve Peter Funk of any responsibility for the matter.
“She seduced him,” said Elder Plett. “This is exactly the reason men and women aren’t supposed to sit near each other in church. Next thing you know he’ll be sampling her extra garlic dills!”
If convicted the couple could face up to ten years cleaning up after Young People’s on Fridays.

Carrie Underwood Spotted Busking for Spare Change Outside Winnipeg Jets Arena,"WINNIPEG, MB
Barefoot Nashville Predators  Vegas Knights fan Carrie Underwood was spotted busking for spare change outside the Winnipeg Jets street party on Saturday. After a devastating loss by her husband’s team, the grumpy country singer decided she’d head to Winnipeg to see if she could earn a little spending money.
“By game time, I had two loonies and three toonies!” said an ecstatic Underwood. “These Winnipegians are sure generous!”
Underwood played all her hits including “Before He Cheats” and “I Told You So” for the crowd of a dozen or so people who happened to notice her.
“It’s nice to see Ms. Underwood getting back to her roots,” said Jets fan Dorothy Loewen. “I threw in a couple quarters and a dime to help her out.”
Underwood had considered holding a concert in the arena itself, but for some reason it was already booked.
“There must be some kind of event happening in there,” said Underwood. “Oh, well, it’s nice that I can still sing a few tunes.”
After performing a few songs on her own, Underwood called up her husband Mike Fischer to accompany her on the bongo drums. The duo plan to tour North America this Spring…and for the rest of their lives.

‘State of Emergency’ Declared at Steinbach Garage Sale Riot,"STEINBACH, MB
Prime Minister Trudeau has followed in his father’s footsteps and invoked the War Measures Act to deal with the increasing hostility during garage sales in the small Mennonite town of Steinbach, Manitoba. In recent weekends, more than three hundred bargain-hunting Mennonites have been hospitalized at local garage sales.
“We’re worried these garage sale tensions are going to escalate and spread to other communities like Chortitz, Blumenort, and even Hochstadt,” said Trudeau. “That is why we’re putting the entire weight of the Canadian military to deal with the situation in Steinbach.”
Intelligence experts suggest that a Mrs. Reimer of Brandt Street was the first to draw blood in a skirmish with a Mrs. Friesen of Loewen Boulevard over the right to purchase a stained Chesterfield.
“After that the situation escalated quickly,” said Trudeau. “Things are especially heated on Thursdays after women’s Bible study.”
Mrs. Reimer is already organizing her ladies into a militia group known as the Front de Liberation de Steinbach, dedicated to liberating local garage sales from Friesen control.
“She gets there first thing in the morning and buys all the good stuff,” said Mrs. Reimer. “Sometimes she even gets there before they open and pleads with them to let her have early access. It’s unfair!”
Locals are unanimous in their praise for Prime Minister Trudeau and his handling of the situation.
“I will always remember the May Crisis of 2018,” said local woman Mrs. Peters. “I will be eternally grateful that we had the sort of proactive leadership that saw what was going on in Steinbach and reacting swiftly.”
This is only the second time the Canadian military has entered the city of Steinbach. The last time being in June of 1972 when a riot broke out after Miss Amanda Kornelsen wore a tank top to church.

After the Winnipeg Jets advanced to the Conference finals for the first time in history, not a single person in the entire province of Manitoba showed up to work this morning.

Mennonite Man Charged With Adding an ‘S’ to the End of Every Word,"STEINBACH, MB
Longtime Steinbach resident Peter Fehr, 76, has been arrested and charged with excessive ‘S’ usage after undercover police overhead him referring to the neighbouring town of Ste-Anne, Manitoba as ‘Ste-Annes’ on numerous occasions.

World’s Largest Snake Den Discovered in Manitoba Legislature,"WINNIPEG, MB
Manitoba Conservation officers were called to the Legislative Buildings in Winnipeg this week after a den of more than 10,000 garter snakes were discovered to have taken over the entire upper floor. The snakes are believed to have migrated from Manitoba’s famous Narcisse snake pits to occupy a habitat more suitable for their species.
“It makes a lot of sense,” said snake expert Belinda Peters. “These snakes will always find their way to a suitable environment for their type. I’m surprised no one noticed them before. It happens every year.”
Thousands of tourists who flock to Manitoba every year to see the world’s largest mass orgy of mating garter snakes will now be able to witness the snakes in action at a more convenient central Winnipeg location.
“It’s really a wonder of the world,” said Peters. “I know that other provincial and national capitals claim to have snake pits of their own, but we’ve got the world’s largest. Look it up. We’re in the Guinness Book of Records.”
Peters says that although some may find the snakes off-putting, she reminds the public that garter snakes are mostly harmless.
“They may be slithery and disgusting writhing altogether in an netted mass,” said Peters, “but the worst you’ll get it is a harmless little bite on your finger.”
Peters warns the public to keep their distance and not to touch or pick up the snakes, though she says not to worry if you do get bit, as the Manitoba garter snake is not poisonous.

The Best Mennonite Pop Culture References,"When it comes to pop culture references, it seems our cousins the Amish get all the attention. Englishers probably consider them more “exotic,” and therefore more cinematic or something. Yes, there are plenty of books written by Mennonites about Mennonites, but when it comes to pop culture references from the outside, they are few and far between. Besides the CBC show Pure, we don’t appear much in music, television, and feature films. Still, we did manage to find a handful of Menno pop culture references. Here they are. (These are real).
The Simpsons

In this 2003 episode of the Simpsons, the family calls on the Amish to help them build a treehouse. Marge is impressed with their work and comments, “The Amish are so industrious. Not like those shiftless Mennonites,” who are shown playing craps. It’s no surprise to find a Mennonite reference in the Simpons, as show founder Matt Groening is of Russian Mennonite descent, his father Homer Groening, being a Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonite from Saskatchewan.
Joan Baez

Released in 1997, the song “Lily” by 1960s folk legend and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Joan Baez mentions Mennonites. Referring to a childhood friend named Lily, she says, “Mennonite children like wild Indians in a one room school house.” Lily also “lived in a farmhouse at the edge of town,” and “at sixteen, ran away, married, her first chance to escape.”
John K. Samson

Canadian indie rock icon John K. Samson (formerly of the Weakerthans and Propaghandi) wrote about the longitudinal centre of Canada, now prominently marked on Highway 1 east of Winnipeg, near the town of Landmark. He remarks of this place, “past the Mint where a circle of provincial flags and flagging in the front yard,” that the “roar of rumble strips the Mennonite meter of the flood forecast.”
The 49th Parallel

Not quite Mennonite, but our friends the Hutterites get a few scenes in this classic British film by Michael Powell. Starring Laurence Olivier and Leslie Howard, The 49th Parallel was up for Best Picture at the Oscars that year. Meant to scare the Americans into joining the war effort, the film tells the story of Nazi spies who invade Canada via the Hudson Bay near Churchill, Manitoba. They then make their way on foot to Winnipeg and eventually to the West Coast. Just outside Winnipeg, however, they stumble upon a Hutterite colony and attempt to get the German-speaking Anabaptists to join them. The Hutterites emphatically turn down the offer. According to GAMEO, “filming of the outdoor scenes of the Hutterian Brethren was quite authentic for they were filmed at the Iberville Schmeideleut Hutterite Colony at Elie, Manitoba. Initially the Hutterians were happy to assist with the filming until one day (actress) Elisabeth Bergner was spotted by a Hutterian woman smoking and painting her nails. Incensed, the Hutterian woman knocked the cigarette from Bergner’s mouth with a slap in the face. Filming was halted until (director) Michael Powell pleaded with the community to let them continue. Bergner was eventually replaced by the much younger Glynis Johns.” You can watch the 49th Parallel in its entirety on Youtube.
“Weird” Al Yankovic

In 1996, famed comedy musician, “Weird” Al Yankovic, released a parody of Coolio’s “Gangsta’s Paradise.”  The song primarily focuses on the Amish, although in one line Yankovic says, “we’re all crazy Mennonites living in an Amish paradise.” While it’s not entirely accurate to equate the two groups, it is true that the Amish were founded as a result of a schism between Jakob Amman and the Swiss Brethren (later to be known as Swiss Mennonites).
Oscar Wilde

In his most famous play “The Importance of Being Earnest,” Irish writer and humourist Oscar Wilde writes about Anabaptists. In Act 3, Chausible says to Jack, “I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing. They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.”
Modern Family

Perhaps the funniest one-liner on this list is in a 2014 episode of the popular sitcom Modern Family. (Sorry, no clip). Mitch and Cam are at the wedding planners preparing for their wedding. When Mitch questions the high cost, the planner says it does not include “alcohol, cake, or music.” Mitch quickly retorts: “What’s that — the Mennonite package?”

Steinbach Residents Excited for Opening of New Petting Zoo on Main Street,"STEINBACH, MB
Families throughout Southeast Manitoba are waking up early this morning, trying to be first in line outside the new Giant Tiger on Main Street.
“I got all the kids ready to go at 5 AM. We want to be the first to pet that giant tiger,” said local mom Andrea Warkentine. “I don’t know what other animals they’ve got in there, but I’ve heard they’re going to be really big.”
Steinbach’s Giant Tiger is being hailed as the most family-friendly attraction in town, though the Mennonite Heritage Village begs to differ.
“They may have one abnormally large cat, but, how long before your kids get bored of the thing?” said MHV spokesperson Barney Dueck, “I mean it’s just one giant tiger and we’ve all seen tigers before. Besides, just think of the lineups.”
With the new petting zoo opening this week, Steinbach residents were also excited about the other family-friendly attraction across the street.
“I’ve always wondered what’s in that SCU building,” said Warkentine. “The tigers they’ve got in there must be enormous !”
The Warkentines were apparently very disappointed with their petting zoo experience, saying that the only animals they found at Giant Tiger were some rambunctious Penner children.",NaN,"May 6, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/gianttiger-e1525367320295.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake

Penner Family Celebrates Cousin Peter’s Graduation from the Kid’s Table,"KLEEFELD, MB
The Penner family of Kleefeld are proud to announce that Cousin Peter, who had, for many decades, been considered too immature to sit with the adults has been graduated to the adult table for the next gathering. Cousin Peter, who is now well into his 40s, is excited to finally eat with the uncles and big kids.
“Over the years I’ve seen many of my cousins graduate to the adult table, but for some reason Grandma Penner always puts me at the kid’s table…until now!” said an ecstatic Cousin Peter. “I guess I’ve finally learned to chew with my mouth closed and eat all my veggies.”
Cousin Peter had been sitting at the kid’s table all through the 80s and 90s, and recently was sitting with his cousins once removed and even some cousins twice removed.
“I know it was a little hard for him to slide his knees under there yet,” said Grandma Penner, 96, “but, you should have seen his table manners! It was embarrassing. Sometimes he’d even open his eyes while praying!”
Cousin Peter is also very excited that his 70-year-old mother Mrs. Ruth Penner, will no longer be cutting up his food into little bite-size pieces and expecting him to drink from a sippy cup.
“I’m finally going to experience everything the adult table has to offer,” said Cousin Peter. “I hope that some day I’ll even be asked to bless the hands that have prepared it.”
Unfortunately for Cousin Peter, after spilling the Kool-Aid and refusing to take the end piece from the loaf, he was quickly relegated to the kid’s table once again and replaced with young Sarah, aged 9, who all the adults felt with more responsible, polite, and a better conversationalist.

Trump Pays Hush Money to Elderly Mennonite Woman,"CORN, OK
Fox News confirmed last night that prior to the 2016 Presidential election President Trump, then candidate for the Republican Party, paid more than $200,000 of his own money to Aganetha “Stormy” Dueck of Corn, Oklahoma. Trump allegedly paid off Mrs. Dueck, 87, to keep her from reporting in the church bulletin about their relationship back in 2003.
“Back in those days, Mrs. Dueck was a desirable young woman, just barely in her 70s,” said Fox News reporter Patricia Foster. “Apparently they met at an MCC Relief Sale and the rest is history.”
It’s not known the extent of the relationship between Stormy Dueck and President Trump, but recently released photos show the two of them holding a hymnal together at the Corn Gospel Mennonite Church.
“Even with all that hush money, Mrs. Dueck could not be silenced,” said Foster. “It appears she called Mrs. Penner last week and let it slip about her and President Trump. After that, the whole town knew about it.”
The Trump Administration has responded to the allegations calling them “preposterous” and “fake news.”
“The only financial transaction President Trump has had with a Mennonite woman is during the Lancaster quilt auction last fall,” said Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “I’d also like to remind you that he wasn’t the President at the time of the alleged interaction with this Stormy Dueck woman. What transpires between a private citizen and a Mennonite lady is none of your concern.”
Stormy Dueck has already spent the $200,000 on upgrades to the wheelchair ramp at the local nursing home and a commemorative cairn in honour of her late husband and renowned shekjbenjel Peter K. Dueck.",NaN,"May 3, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/elderlywoman-e1525366652713.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Winnipeg Hospitals Overrun With Jets-Related Heart Attacks,"WINNIPEG, MB
After a narrow defeat in double overtime on Sunday, followed by a come-from-way-behind victory on Tuesday, Winnipeg hospitals are now filled to the brim with Jets-induced heart attack victims.
“If this keeps up, we’re going to have to open up a whole new ward of the hospital to deal with them all,” said Dr. Reimer. “It’s getting really bad. It doesn’t help that most of these fans are downing gallons of beer and large crates of poutine during the game.”
Winnipeg doctors are urging the Jets to “just kick total ass” on Thursday, claiming that a dominant performance would save lives.
“Jauma lied! Things are especially bad in North Kildonan with the Mennonite population,” said Reimer. “They’re a calm and peaceful people and just aren’t used to this level of excitement.”
Reimer say regular cardio exercise would help locals handle the stress of hockey playoffs.
“You’ve gotta get that heart rate up on on regular basis,” said Reimer. “Waiting for the Jets or Blue Bombers to make the playoffs is simply not often enough to give your ticker a proper workout.”

Mennonite Union Demands 80 Hour Work Week,"GOSHEN, IN
Mennonite Workers Local 606 walked off the job this past Friday, demanding that the work week be increased to 80 hours from the regular 40. The striking workers paraded around various Mennonite churches in town in hope that the elders would take action on the matter.
“We want a week that’s 80 hours, plus a monthly bath or shower!” shouted the workers. “We don’t want no leisure time. It’s a sin, should be a crime!”
The workers are also demanding that their pay be reduced to a “less showy” $8 an hour.
“Humble us with your pay, then make us slave away all day,” they yelled. “We don’t need much more than eight. The simple life for us is great!”
Things got a little rowdy when one striking Mennonite worker threw a Molotov cocktail through a church window calling the pastor a “fascist.”
“Pastor Dave is just part of the system trying to keep us workers well paid and well fed,” said the worker. “We won’t stand for this generosity any longer! I find his demand for wage hikes and his concern for our health and safety a little insulting quite frankly. It’s like he doesn’t have confidence we can support our families on just $1200 a month!”
The strike lasted all afternoon before the workers decided to spend the evening singing hymns with the cousins at grandma’s house.

"Mennonite Pastor Asks for Standing Desk, Told He Already Has One","GOSHEN, IN
Fresh out of seminary, Pastor Dave was really excited about his new Associate Pastor position at East Mennonite until he discovered first hand just how frugal the church board can be. Dave was concerned about the effects of sitting for prolonged periods of time and asked for one of those standing desks to be installed in his office. Instead, the elders had other ideas.
“Ach, a standing desk? Who’s ever heard of such a thing?” said Elder Yoder. “If he wants to type out his sermon while standing up, he can use the pulpit.”
Pastor Dave did try to use the pulpit for a few hours last week but found the lady who came in to vacuum the sanctuary always stood expectantly and stared at him.
“I was just trying to get some work done at my standing desk, but it didn’t take long before a crowd had gathered,” said Pastor Dave. “I tried to tell them they’d have to wait until Sunday, but they just wouldn’t take no for an answer. So I ended up making up a sermon on the fly.”
As it turns out Dave’s impromptu sermon was just as informed and nuanced as church members were accustomed to at East Mennonite.
“They started to come back every day expecting a sermon. The seniors stopped by on the way to the coffee shop,” said Dave. “It got to be too much. So I’ve gone back to sitting in my office on one of those wooden church basement chairs.”
Not only has the church generously provided Pastor Dave with a standing desk, but he’s also being provided an old sofa in the youth room that will now serve as his parsonage.

"Mom’s Spoon Preferred to Dad’s Belt, Survey Results Suggest","SALEM, OR
A new survey of Mennonite children and ex-children suggests a strong preference for mom’s spoon to dad’s belt during disciplinary sessions. The survey asked more than a thousand Mennonite children and two thousand adults, which method they preferred and the choice was overwhelming.
“Personally, I prefer to stand in the corner, but if I have to choose between the belt and spoon, I always go with the spoon,” said little Andrew. “To be quite honest, it kind of tickles…”
The spoon was deemed so ineffective to curb bad attitudes and disobedient spirits, that some Mennonite mothers began experimenting with force-feeding their children raw onions.
“You’ve got to do something to keep them in line,” said Mrs. Berg. “Lord knows my wooden spoon ain’t doing the trick.”
While the wooden spoon was useful for mixing batter, it seemed ineffective for any other purpose.
“Those little rascals just don’t respect the spoon like I did when I was a child,” said Mrs. Berg. “Pretty much the only thing that does it these days is threatening to cut down on their Nintendo time.”
The survey also suggested that “wait until your Dad gets home,” was an effective threat in 7 out of 10 situations.

Mennonite Nylons Now Come in Three New Shades of Brown,"GRUNTHAL, MB
Mennonite ladies across Southern Manitoba were excited to discover all the new shades of brown being offered by their local nylon stocking supplier. In addition to the classic chestnut brown, Mennonite nylons now come in tan, smokey topaz, and burnt umber, a personal favourite of Mrs. Loewen’s.
“I never thought I’d see the day,” said a pensive Mrs. Loewen. “This shade of brown perfectly compliments my flower dress and white sneakers. It’s so much better than the old brown nylons George bought me back in Christmas ’88.”
Mrs. Loewen is so proud of her new brown nylons that she wears them rolled down to the ankles to make sure she’s getting good value out of them.
“There’s no point in hiking them up anywhere past your hemline since no one can see them anyway,” said Mrs. Loewen. “Oba, my ankles look just ravishing in these new dark brown pantyhose.”
The biggest seller, however, is an incredibly sexy pair of russet brown compression stockings.
“I must say these brown compression stockings are absolutely lovely and they do wonders for my circulation,” said Mrs. Loewen. “I’ve also got an amazing pair of cocoa brown nylons with a reinforced comfort panel and control top. They’re divine!”

Mennonite Quartet Breaks Up After Discovering Tenor is Lutheran,"WINNIPEG, MB
One of Manitoba’s top Mennonite quartets, The Gospel Bottom Boys, has decided to call it quits after more than thirty years together when it was discovered that tenor Bennie Schmidt was actually a Lutheran.
“I just can’t believe it. All these years he was a closet Lutheran,” said quartet leader and alto Timmy Dueck. “How on earth did he sing ‘Wade in the Water’ or ‘Down to the River to Pray’ with a straight face?”
Schmidt had been hiding his Lutheranism from the rest of the quartet since 1987.
“I’m surprised no one noticed my Plautdietsch deficiency before,” said Schmidt. “It’s not all bad, though. The one good thing about leaving the quartet is that I’ll never have to pretend to like cracklings and toast again.”
Schmidt plans to start his own Lutheran quartet called Martin’s Music Makers. He plans to hold auditions this fall.
“I’m not too picky,” said Schmidt. “As long as you were baptized sometime before you turned ten or eleven I’ll take you.”
The remaining Gospel Bottom Boys plan to find a replacement tenor, this time with strict guidelines.
“We’re not taking any chances this time,” said Dueck. “If you can’t recite the Schleitheim Confession from memory you don’t stand a chance.”
The new Mennonite quartet, which hopes to be ready for the Christmas quartet season, is going to be known as Luther’s Folly.

Ford to Stop Producing Mennonite Buggies,"DEARBORN, MI
There is shocking news out of Michigan today as Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Hackett announced that the company would cease production of Mennonite and Amish buggies, other than the Mustang, by the year 2020.
“The market speaks. There just wasn’t the demand for buggies that there used to be,” said Hackett. “Most Mennonites these days are driving pickup trucks and minivans.”
Even though demand for buggies has been soft in recent years, buggy enthusiasts Peter and Anna Rempel of Altona were disappointed in the news.
“I must say, I’m not surprised. I knew when they stopped shoeing horses, that the end was near,” said Mr. Rempel. “Well, I guess we’ll have to look elsewhere. Maybe get one of those electric buggies by that Elon Musk fella.”
The Rempels plan to keep using their buggy as long as they can.
“Anna and I are real groundbreakers. We were the first ones in Altona to get a buggy with springs the seat,” said Rempel. “Oba, did we get flack for that. We were excommunicated nearly.”

Mennonite Woman Converts to Hinduism Five Minutes into Jillian Michaels Yoga Meltdown DVD,"BOISSEVAIN, MB
Yogaphobia has invaded a small Manitoba town after Mrs. Martens, 42, longtime women’s ministry co-ordinator at the local Mennonite church, declared she was “done with the faith” and decided to dedicate her life to Vishnu just five minutes into a Jillian Michaels Yoga Meltdown DVD.
“See, this is exactly what I warned you all about,” said concerned local yogaphobe Mrs. Wiebe. “Exercising can lead to exorcisms! It can happen really quick.”
Mrs. Martens had just gotten herself into the tadasana position, and had barely worked herself into a sweat, when she suddenly said, “to heck with it” and immediately Googled “how to change religions.”
“The Mennonite faith doesn’t offer much in terms of getting those kinks out of your neck and increasing flexibility,” explained Mrs. Martens. “Billy Graham was a great evangelist, but he’s got nothing on Jillian Michaels!”
In response to the unexpected conversion of Mrs. Martens, the Boissevain Yogaphobe Committee has been distributing literature on Main Street.
“In addition to yoga, we’re also against butter chicken, the sport of cricket, and sitting cross-legged,” said committee chair Mrs. Wiebe. “Oh, and we’re not too keen on that new Mindy Kaling show either.”
Boissevain Yogaphobes also plan to go door-to-door in the area urging residents to burn their Lululemons.

Mennonite Homeschoolers Add Crokinole to their Core Curriculum,"SWIFT CURRENT, SK
Homeschool parents Edna and Harold Klassen of Swift Current are committed to providing their children with the highest level of education possible. Recently, the Klassens decided to cut back on math and add three hours per day of intense crokinole instruction.
“We’ve got to get these children started on knipsing while they’re still young,” said Edna. “Studies show that just three to four hours of knipsing a day can do wonders for your child’s self-confidence and performance on International Crokinole Standards testing.”
In addition to knipsbrat, the Klassens have revamped the curriculum to include other essential Mennonite skills like knacking zoat, telling Plautdietsch jokes, and not squirming in church.
“After a full morning of crokinole, we have a quick lunch and then spend a couple hours practicing sitting still in church,” said Edna. “Brendan has trouble still, but little Bethany’s getting pretty good at it.”
Even though the homeschoolers have eliminated math completely from the curriculum, they still scored 80% higher than the provincial average for public school students.

American Hockey Expert Makes His Picks for NHL Playoffs,"NEW YORK, NY
America’s foremost hockey expert has made his prognostication for the 2018 NHL playoffs. After a meticulous five minute Google search where he learned the entirety of his hockey knowledge, the American analyst made his predictions for round two.
“Well, I’ve gotta say, Bob, I really like the Jets chances in this series against something called the Nashville Predators? Wait a second, that can’t be right? Nashville has a team? Hmmm…That’s what it says,” said America’s most knowledgable hockey pundit Kenneth Gerard. “Well, anyway, yeah, the Jets will take it in 6 games.”
Throughout the broadcast, Gerrard consistently referred to the sport as “ice hockey,” and then took to Instagram to post his predictions for the Sharks-Knights series.

Not wanting to ignore ice hockey’s biggest star, Gerrard did a quick Google Image search, and then posted his thoughts on Crosby.

This Crosby news was so exciting, that even ESPN picked it up.

Well, the secret is out! William and Kate’s newborn baby boy, and fifth in line to the British crown, has been named “Prince Corny” after William’s distant cousin Corny Bueckert of Rosengart. Weighing in at 8lbs 7oz, adorable little Prince Corny is the heaviest royal newborn so far and the first to be named after a Mennonite from Yantsied.
“We’re really excited to welcome a new child into the family,” said William. “So far he’s quite the handful. He cries and cries until you feed him some sunflower seeds. Man, that kid can knack zoat!”

Mennonite Grandma Punishes Grandkids By Making Them Chew Thrills Gum,"MITCHELL, MB
Local grandma Mrs. Agnes Wiebe, 72, unleashed the harshest punishment known to Mennonites this week by making her misbehaving grandkids chew a piece of soap-flavoured Thrills gum for a full fifteen minutes.
“I don’t like to be so harsh on them,” said Mrs. Wiebe, “but after three stern warnings they still hadn’t cleaned up the toys and enough is enough. Out came the Thrills.”
Little Eric and Samantha screamed in horror when they saw the purple gum, having been made familiar with the substance once when their mother Ruth ran out of patience.
“They know what this gum package means,” said Mrs. Wiebe. “Sometimes all I have to do it just take it out of my purse and they’re instantly transformed into little angels.”
Despite her best efforts, however, this time Mrs. Wiebe’s plan backfired.
“I was about to punish Samantha for calling Eric “stupid,” which is a word they’re not allowed to say in this house, when I suddenly realized I was all out of gum,” said Mrs. Wiebe. “It seems Grandpa’s been stealing Thrills from my purse whenever I’m not looking.”

Nation Shocked as Canadian NHL Team Wins Playoff Series Without Rioting,"WINNIPEG, MB
Tens of thousands of fans lined the streets of downtown Winnipeg on Friday night to celebrate the Jets first round playoff victory over the Minnesota Wild. Jets fans bucked decades of Canadian hockey tradition by not destroying any property, or stealing any big screen TVs.
“Never before in the history of Canadian sport have fans celebrated a team’s playoff success with so little theft or property damage,” said RCMP Constable Wallace. “I mean they didn’t even light any parked cars on fire. It was quite the sight to behold!”
After the Jets victory, Canadians from coast to coast turned to their television sets expecting to see downtown Winnipeg in flames, but all they saw were a bunch of people wearing white t-shirts and drinking lite beer.
“We did nab a few people who had a bit too much to drink, but that’s it,” said Wallace. “I couldn’t believe it. There were all these windows in all these buildings just waiting to be smashed…and not a single one was. Shocking!”
Canucks fans were so disturbed by the peaceful celebrations in Winnipeg that thousands of them roamed the streets of Vancouver breaking stuff and roughing up strangers just to show Winnipeg how it’s done.

Why Every Single Winnipeg Jets Player is Actually a Mennonite,"I’m not much one for conspiracies, but I think something’s going on here.

Mennonites Celebrate 420 by Drinking Yerba on Parliament Hill,"OTTAWA, ON
Thousands of Mennonite ‘Yerbaheads,’ as they call themselves, set up their lawn chairs on the steps of the Canadian Parliament buildings today to celebrate 420. Mr. Johan Dueck came all the way from Friedensfeld out in Yantsied to get together will his fellow yerba drinkers.
“Every year we do this, but this year I thought it was special,” said Dueck, sipping on some choice Parajito. “This year they’re finally legalizing yerba!”
In addition to sipping yerba out in the open, the Mennonite 420 celebrations also include knacking zoat in the Senate chamber and rubbernecking at all the Englisher tourists.
“This is our last 420, so it’s also our biggest,” said Dueck. “There are more people from Vankla here than at the Morden bar on a Friday night.”
There was initially some concern about second-hand yerba mate, as the bombillas were seen being passed from person to person, but after a brief investigation, authorities concluded that it was all okay since they were all relatives anyone and therefore “had the same germs.”
“All my frintschoft are here: Peter, Annie, Klaas, George, Benny, Reverend David, Nettie, Agnes, both Sarahs, even the illegitimate Friesen cousins we don’t really talk about. Everybody’s here!” said Dueck. “We don’t agree with Justin Trudeau about a lot of things, but we’re sure glad he’s pro-yerba!”

Church Sets Record With 7 Hour Welcome Time,"WINKLER, MB
When the pastor of South Winkler Gospel Mennonite Church decided to ask the congregation to turn around and heartily welcome the folks around them, little did he know they would break a long-standing Guinness record.
“We’re just a friendly bunch,” said Pastor Tom. “Either that or they’re all trying to avoid listening to my sermon.”
After the Pastor’s cue, church members were able to Je’schwauts for more than seven hours, despite multiple attempts to regain their attention by saying “na jo” or by playing popular hymns on the organ.
“Nothing worked,” said Pastor Tom. “They just kept on chatting. Man, those Mennonites can talk, yet.”
As usual, though, despite plenty of time to meet and greet everyone in the audience, a few newcomers were still missed and sat alone in awkward silence at the back to the sanctuary the entire time.
“I’d like to think we could get around and greet everyone,” said Tom, “but, unfortunately, sometimes that’s just not possible. It’s too bad. I hope they come back next week.”",NaN,"April 20, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shakinghands-e1512865014551.jpg?resize=640%2C360,Fake
Local Old Colony Church Experiments with Overhead Projector,"REINLAND, MB
The local Old Colony church is making waves in Reinland this week after purchasing a used overhead projector from the MCC. After singing hymns out of the hymnal for centuries, the church is now experimenting with “Shine Jesus Shine” projected just above the place where all the elders sit.
“We got the ladies to write out all the words with their black markers on the transparencies at the Wednesday Bible study,” said Elder Krahn. “Dan we got one of the young people to turn it on and shine it against the wall yet.”
The women’s section was quite pleased with the new technology, though many of the men were upset at the change.
“Dat bright light makes it hard to see Miss Martens over dare,” said young Abe Wall. “And, oba, let me tell you, Miss Martens is the only reason I come to church!”
The congregation sang three “Praise and Worship” songs via overhead and even one responsive reading yet.
“I’m not sure if it really makes any difference. You read it from a book, or you read it off the wall. Makes not difference to me,” explained Wall. “I’m all for change. I’m hoping the elders eventually let us wear jeans and sit mixed in with the ladies.”
After the service, the overhead projector guy spent three hours trying to wash the black marker ink off his hands.

‘Hands that Have Prepared It’ Feel Extra Blessed,"AYLMER, ON
Mrs. Jansen’s hands are finally starting to feel the effects of having been blessed so often during the years. Thanks to Grandpa Jansen’s rote Sunday lunch prayer, which always included the line, “bless the hands that have prepared it,” Mrs. Jansen has the healthiest hands in southern Ontario.
“The skin is smooth, blemish-free, and without a hint of rheumatism,” said Mrs. Jansen. “At my age, I feel very blessed to have such impeccable hands. They’ll be ‘preparing it’ for years to come, I can assure you.”
Mrs. Jansen’s hands have been cutting carrots, kneading dough, and stuffing sausage for as long as she can remember and they show no signs of slowing down.
“Normally women my age can barely microwave a frozen bowl of green bean soup,” said Jansen. “But with all the blessing my hands have received over the years, I can open a pickle jar without even having to run hot water over it or tapping the lid with a spoon.”
Mrs. Jansen’s blessed hands have also been used in the cover photo of the EMC Ladies’ Cookbook and the Aylmer Quilting Club Catalogue.
“There are women half my age who wish they could have hands like this,” said Jansen. “I can’t complain, though I do wish Grandpa Jansen had prayed for my upper arm flab once in a while.”",NaN,"April 18, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hands-e1517791708193.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake

Quiz: Can You Tell an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie from a Chocolate Chip Cookie?,"One of the greatest tragedies in any young person’s life is to eagerly bite into what you thought was Oma’s delicious chocolate chip cookie only to discover it’s actually oatmeal raisin. It can be traumatizing to a child! And Oma would sometimes throw oatmeal in with the chocolate chips, so it really got confusing. As Mennonites (and people of other faiths for that matter) age, most of us learn very quickly to identify a raisin cookie from a chocolate cookie. Some of us, though, never learn, and make this mistake throughout our lives. So, let’s test your skills. Can you tell an oatmeal raisin cookie from a chocolate chip cookie?

Facebook Hires Nosy Mennonite Women to Collect Data on Users,"MENLO PARK, CA
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday that he would be hiring Mrs. Edna Martens, 71, of Reinland, Manitoba and her nine spinster sisters to obtain as much information as they could on Facebook users. The information obtained by the instrusive Mennonite women will be used to help target advertising on the world’s largest social media network.
“After congress shut down our ability to track data electronically, we had no other choice but to access the treasure trove of data stored by the women of Reinland,” said Zuckerberg. “Originally we wanted to get Mrs. Bueckert and her crew from the EMC, but she was already under contract with Twitter, so Mrs. Martens was the next best thing.”
Mrs. Martens claims to have more than 80 gigs worth of information on every man, woman, and child in southern Manitoba, and has more than her fair share of info on Mennonites in other parts of the country as well.
“She uses cookies to collect her data,” said Zuckerberg. “Oh, sure, you can delete your search history and all that, but there aren’t many people alive who can resist one of Mrs. Martens’ ammonia cookies! I know I can’t!”
Zuckerberg claims he only has the best of intentions with Mrs. Martens’ data, and that is to make sure that every Facebook user is getting between three and five farmer sausage ads on their Facebook feed each day.
“Thanks to Mrs. Martens’ data we know who likes formavorscht and who prefers shinke fleish,” said Zuckerberg. “We can also tell if you’re more of a Papsi and a Ravel kind of girl or the type who devours pistachio pudding every chance you get. Mrs. Martens knows it all.”
Facebook stock rallied to record highs after announcing the hiring of nosy Mennonite women.

Stage Fright Strikes Local Pastor Moments Before Altar Call,"SASKATOON, SK
Beloved local pastor Kevin Wall was nearing the end of his sermon and was about to ask the organist to play ‘Just as I Am’ when he was suddenly struck with a severe bout of stage fright.
“I was all ready to go with the altar call,” said Rev. Wall, “but then I looked out into the crowd and it hit me – here I am standing in front of hundreds of people and there’s that woman I had a crush on back in Bible school, and there’s Tante Lina, she’ll surely have some criticism after the service, and there’s Elder Friesen and….”
Witnesses say Reverend Wall stumbled his words, froze for a moment, and then glared awkwardly into the sea of Mennonite parishioners.
“They always told us in Bible school that if anything like this happens, you should picture your audience naked,” explained Wall, “so I looked at Mrs. Agatha Penner there in the back row and….”
At this point Reverend Wall collapsed on the stage and Elder Friesen rushed to his aid.
“He’s recovering in the hospital,” said Elder Friesen. “I guess he learned his lesson the hard way. If you ever have stage fright at East Saskatoon Mennonite church don’t ever picture Mrs. Penner without her clothes on.”

Mennonite Fans Ruin Winnipeg Jets Whiteout By Wearing All Black Suits,"WINNIPEG, MB
Apparently unaware of the long-standing playoff tradition of wearing white, local Old Order Mennonite Peter Friesen decided to wear his very best black suit to Vanapag Yats game this week.
“Vell, I vanted to sheer for the Yats and they yust about didn’t let me in the arena wearing dese clothes yet,” said Friesen. “For some reason dey prefer da white clothes. Oba, how weltjlich!”
Friesen stood out like a sore thumb with his black suit and black hat in a sea of white.
“I was even on the Jumbotron,” said Friesen. “I guess I’ll have to axe for forgiveness for that, since we’re really not supposed to have our pictures taken. Graven imagery, nah oba!”
Friesen was initially met with hostility by Jets fans who assumed he was cheering for the Minnesota Wild.
“At first I couldn’t figure out why on earth anyone would wear all black to a Jets game,” said Jets fan Sarah Thompson. “But then I figured it out. This must be one of Patrik Laine’s relatives!”
Once they realized they were sitting next to Patrik Laine’s Amish frintschoft, the fans welcomed Mr. Friesen and his black attire with open arms.

It looks like an extended winter this year in Winnipeg. Daily Bonnet meteorologists have examined the evidence and are officially predicting whiteout conditions well into June.
“No early spring this year,” said Daily Bonnet weatherman Andrew J. Bergman. “I’m afraid you’ll have to bundle up and stay inside nearly every evening for the next couple months. I guess you might as well watch television or something…”
The whiteout in Manitoba is expected to last until a Stanley Cup parade in June officially welcomes summer.

B.C. Premier Shuts Down Progress on Kinder Surprise Pipeline,"VICTORIA, BC
Concerned that increased access to thin chocolate eggs and cheap plastic toys may adversely affect the health and welfare of British Columbians, Premier John Horgan announced Tuesday that he would do everything in his power to halt construction of the massive new Kinder Surprise pipeline.
“We can’t have those little German chocolate eggs just flooding into our province,” said Horgan. “This Kinder Surprise pipeline will bring us nothing but trouble let me tell you!”
The full environmental impact of the Kinder Surprise pipeline is not yet known, though Horgan believes it’s not worth the risk.
“Can you imagine what would happen if there was a spill?” pondered Horgan. “B.C. children would be so hopped up on sugar, they’d be more uncontrollable than they already are. It’s bad enough that Abbotsford kids are out of control. We don’t want that kind of behaviour to spread across the province.”
Some people, however, support the Kinder Surprise pipeline, including the Premier of Alberta Rachel Notley, who argued that getting Kinder Surprises flowing again was a core component of the Canadian economy.
“Oh, sure, you’ll have a few kids on sugar rushes and some might be disappointed when they see how lousy the toy is,” said Notley, “but that’s a small price to pay for all the jobs that building a Kinder Surprise pipeline will provide.”
Notley is also proposing a massive Toblerone pipeline that will run straight through the Rocky Mountains, across the prairies, and end up in the Hudson Bay near Churchill where resident polar bears will transport the Toblerones to remote northern communities.

Long-Suffering Vegas Knights Fan Finally Sees His Team Make the Playoffs,"LAS VEGAS, NV
Long time Vegas Golden Knights fan Peter Sawatzky, 43, has suffered through many seasons without a winning team. Sawatzky, originally from Kleefeld, Manitoba, lives in Sin City during the winter and has had to wait long and hard for the Knights to make the playoffs.
“There were years when I felt like we didn’t even have a team,” said Sawatzky. “I mean up until very recently no one in Vegas paid any attention to their hockey team. But now we’re fully on board!”
After decades of posting not a single victory in the regular season, the Golden Knights have seemingly come out of nowhere this year.
“It’s nice to see this town finally support their team,” said Sawatzky. “I just wish there had been more fans like me who suffered through all the years when the team didn’t even seem to show up at the arena.”
Sawatzky said that although he’s a huge Vegas Knights fan, he still has a soft spot for the Winnipeg Jets.
“I’m no fair weather fan. I cheered for the Jets between ’96 and 2011 when it seemed like no one else was,” said Sawatzky. “It’s so nice to see the Knights and Jets do so well this year.”
Sawatzky said he’s rooting for the Golden Knights to finally go all the way this year, but hopes they don’t have to face those scrappy Hartford Whalers in the finals.

Mennonite Woman Saves Thousands By Separating the Two-Ply,"TABER, AB
Local woman Maria Dueck, 43, estimates she’s saved her family more than five thousand dollars this year by turning her two-ply toilet paper into one. As a mother of twelve growing children and a husband who routinely uses more than his fair share of Cottonelle, Mrs. Dueck goes through quite a lot of toilet paper in a year and is not one to allow unnecessary luxuries like a second ply.
“If you’re careful not to press your fingers through the paper, one-ply will do you just fine,” said Dueck. “If any of the children complain about the lack of comfort that one-ply toilet paper provides, I simply remind them that back in my day we used pages torn from the Eatons catalogue!”
Dueck had trouble, however, convincing her husband Earl to get on board with the new plan.
“I once busted in on him and caught him folding over the toilet paper, sometimes two or three times, yet,” said Dueck. “I let him know in no uncertain terms that we are a single-ply family and any attempt to skirt the rules by stacking or wadding up the paper will be met with swift penalties!”
Mrs. Dueck plans to stand guard outside the washroom and hand out individual squares to make sure no one is abusing the system.
“I’m also making sure no one wastes energy by running the fan too long,” said Dueck. “It’s a shame, but I think sometimes the kids get so used to modern luxuries like bathroom fans and two-ply paper that they forget our Mennonite heritage and traditions.”

Mennonite Couple Has Quick Nooner,"KIDRON, OH
Mrs. Anne Miller of Kidron rushed home on her lunch break this past Friday to meet her husband Peter and have a quick noon-hour Bible reading.
“We really didn’t have much time, but we managed to get through the last chapter of Joshua and a snippet of Judges before I had to get back to the office,” said Anne. “I’m almost embarrassed to even talk about it. These nooners are our dirty little secret.”
Peter really enjoyed the nooner this week and hopes to make it a weekly tradition.
“I mean, you can’t do it too often or people start to get suspicious. I’ve even started to park my car a block away and walk home so the neighbours don’t get any ideas,” said Peter. “If old Mrs. Lehman knew what was going on between 12:15 and 12:45 she might have a heart attack.”
The Millers feel this time doing their devos in the middle of the day has really spiced up their marriage.
“It’s good to sneak off and dig into the Word together,” said Anne. “I just make sure to give myself five or ten minutes to compose myself before heading back to work. That Doris is such a busybody. She can smell a nooner a mile away.”
The Millers plan to read through the entire Bible in a year, although they admit they may have to expand beyond afternoon delights to get it all done.
“I sure hope I can keep up this pace,” said Anne. “I’d be devastated to come home one day and find that Peter had already read through the Book of Ruth on his own or something.”

Mennonite Man Charged with Distracted Driving for Knacking Zoat Behind the Wheel,"ALTONA, MB
Local man Colin Peters, 41, is facing distracted driving charges after being spotted by Altona police with a bag of Ronnie’s Original Jumbo Sunflower Seeds in one hand and the steering wheel in the other. The arrest came after a recent campaign by Altona police to crackdown on driving under the influence of knackzoat.
“We’re reminding drivers to keep their eyes on the road and both hands on the wheel,” said Constable Kehler. “If you’ve got to knack, please wait until you’re at home on your front lawn like everyone else.”
Police say Peters was caught when he pulled up to Altona’s lone set of traffic lights and rolled down his window to spit out the seeds.
“That’s a dead giveaway,” said Kehler. “As soon as the window goes down and a head leans out, I know the next thing I’m going to see is some Menno trying to knack the shells out the window without getting spit all over his beard.”
Police seized Peters’ car as evidence, where they found a thick mound of zoat and a few Tim Hortons cups.
“The vehicle was filled with seeds: in coffee cups, the ashtray, the glove compartment – everywhere!” said Peters. “It’s no wonder he had to resort to spitting them out the window.”
Altona police are urging residents to knack their zoat in a controlled environment such as Mrs. Janzen’s living room or the Bergthaler Church parking lot.

Ten Amazing Mennonite-Related Google Trends Charts,"We’ve all recently discovered just how much information Google is tracking about us. Even Mennonites yet! So, I decided to use the compare function on Google Trends to see what was happening in the world of Mennonite cyberspace. (These are all real).
Mennonite vs. Amish
First I compared the words “Mennonite” and “Amish” and it seems that other than in a few countries (Canada, Nigeria, South Korea, and some others) our Amish cousins are more popular. If only more of us had kept the buggies and black hats. People seem to like that kind of thing. It’s more photogenic or something.

Menno Simons vs. John Calvin
How about Menno Simons vs. arch-rival John Calvin? Well, it seems John Calvin is trending in almost every country in the world other than Menno’s home country of the Netherlands. For shame. Oh, well, I guess Calvin was predestined to be an Internet star.

Menno Simons vs. Miriam Toews
What about Menno Simons vs. famed Mennonite novelist Miriam Toews? In terms of total searches Menno Simons comes out on top. But then he’s had a 500 year head start. Go Miriam!

Friesen vs. Reimer
Here’s an interesting map. Reimers are more popular than Friesens in almost every country in the world other than Brazil and a few others. I know how much the Friesens love to get down and party during Carnaval, so I guess that makes sense.

Yoder vs. Yoda
Given the popularity of Star Wars I was really surprised this was even close. I’m sure that Skywalker would destroy Hochstetter by an even wider margin.

Winkler vs. Steinbach
I suppose you might attribute Winkler’s dominance here to people searching for pictures of Henry Winkler. Then, again, there are about a dozen towns around the globe named Steinbach that might pad the stats. Hmm, what’s going on here? Maybe Winklerites just like googling themselves. Typical Winklerites….

Pacifism vs. War
Umm, well this one wasn’t even close. Pacifism doesn’t even register. It seems it’s totally uncool. Not trendy at all…..

Vereniki vs. Formavorscht
Interesting! Formavorscht (I also tried “farmer sausage” with similar results) doesn’t even register. Let’s face it, when given the choice between googling pictures of perogies or looking for snapshots of sausages, people just love to ogle delicious pockets of dough smothered in schmaunt fat. Makes sense to me.

The Daily Bonnet vs. The Daily Bread
Finally, I decided to compare the Daily Bonnet to popular Christian devotional guide the Daily Bread. It wasn’t even close. Globally people much prefer devotions to satire. That’s nice to hear.

Hmmm…When I limited the search just to Canada, the Daily Bonnet fared a bit better. There even were a few weeks where The Daily Bonnet out-trended the Daily Bread. For shame. Grandma would be very disappointed!

Local Free Church to Charge Admission,"BEZKOSHTOVNO, KS
After declining tithing in recent years a Free Church in the small Kansas town of Bezkoshtovno has decided they have no choice but to charge a nominal admission charge of $7.99 per person. Children under 12 can get in for $4.99, while babies in arms may be carried in at no charge provided they stay in their mother’s laps at all times.
“The Free Church model just wasn’t working. For years we tried it, but we couldn’t pay the power bills or update the hymnals,” said Pastor Ron. “I’m sad to say it, but the Free Church is no longer free.”
The funds will be used to replace the bulb in the overhead projector and repaint the kitchen in the parsonage.
“We hope the fee is not too burdensome for people. We hope people will come to the Free Church even if they have to pay a little something,” said Ron. “I think you’ll get your money’s worth. I mean, you always were before.”
Some members understood the admission fee, while others felt a wee bit betrayed.
“You can’t call yourself a Free Church and then ask for 8 bucks at the door,” said local church-goer Thomas Wiebe. “Well, I guess it’s true what they say: there’s so such thing as a free church.”

Mennonite Man Embarks on New Career After a Weekend of Gorging on Oma’s Cooking,"LEAMINGTON, ON
Local man Billy Fehr has decided to quit his job at the Leamington ketchup factory to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a professional sumo wrestler. Fehr said he made his decision after attending three Easter gatherings and a church faspa this weekend.
“You know, I’ve given up trying to stem the tide,” said Fehr. “Like they always say, if you’ve got it, flaunt it. Sumo wrestling is a natural fit for any man with decades of Mennonite cooking in their bodies.”
Fehr will be heading to Japan this week where he is set to become, shockingly, the first Mennonite man to join a sumo stable.
“I hope to be in shape for the Nagoya Grand Tournament in July. I think I can get in shape if Oma comes along to make me paska and platz,” said Fehr. “With a little will-power and a lot of kielke, my goal is to become a yokozuna someday!”
The Japanese Sumo Federation is currently reviewing Fehr’s application to see if years of abusing his body with Mennonite food give him an unfair advantage.
“We’re examining this man very closely,” said Mr. Kobayashi. “The last thing we want is for our sport to be taken over by Mennonites.”
Fehr says he’s already recruiting his cousins Stan and Timmy as they, too, seem to fit the bill.

The Apocalypse is Officially the ‘Least Favourite Holiday’ on the Church Calendar,"HARRISONBURG, VA
A new study out of Northern Mennonite University reveals that of all the holidays and events on the Christian calendar, the Apocalypse is officially the least favourite among church-goers.
“Most people like Christmas and Easter. A lot of folks even said they enjoyed a good Transfiguration Day service every now and again,” explained theology professor Dawson Yoder. “However, the Apocalypse is highly unpopular for some reason.”
Yoder suggested the unfavourable score given to the Apocalypse might have something to do with the common perception that the day involves a lot of death and destruction.
“There’s just something about the Mark of the Beast, and the Four Horsemen and all that, that leaves a sour taste in people’s mouths,” said Yoder. “Personally, I really don’t get it, but to each his own I guess. What the Apocalypse really needs is some rebranding to boost its image with the church-going public.”
Although the exact date of the Apocalypse is up for debate, Yoder surmises it may happen at some point during the Trump Administration.

Five Controversial Topics You Can’t Joke About With Mennonites,"Believe it or not, Mennonites like to laugh, it’s just that our list of laugh-worthy topics is more limited than others.

Mennonite Man Wows Audience with Stunning Performance of that Piano Song You Play with Your Knuckles,"ABBOTSFORD, BC
Local man Timothy Warkentin left audiences at South Abbotsford EMB stunned this week after his performance of that song you play by rolling your knuckles over a few black keys. It was the greatest piano performance at South Abbotsford since six-year-old Erin Wiebe performed a couple tunes from the Bastien Piano Basic Primer level book last fall.
“What can I say? The man has a gift,” said Mrs. Penner, who was one of more than eight guests who stuck around after faspa on Sunday afternoon to hear the man play. “I know he’s in high demand, but I’m really hoping we can convince him to perform again sometime.”
Warkentin’s lack of formal training has not been an impediment to his development as a pianist.
“I’ve only got one song in my repetoire, but it’s quite the doozy,” said Warkentin. “I can roll my knuckles over those three keys like no one’s business. Even Peter Wall’s got nothing on me!”
But Warkentin’s musical talents know no bounds. The 53-year-old concrete worker said he was planning to branch out into the recorder and maybe even one of those children’s xylophones this spring.
“I’d even be willing to lead the hymn singing at South Abbotsford if they let me,” said Warkentin. “I can’t read music, but I can wing it.”
Abbotsford mayor Henry Braun was so moved by Warkentin’s knuckle-piano performance that he said everyone could take the day off on Monday and has officially dubbed Warkentin as “the Rachmaninoff of the Fraser Valley.”

Grandkids Still Reluctant to Go Anywhere Near Grandma’s Plumi Moos,"REINLAND, MB
The unveiling of Grandma’s famous Easter plumi moos this Sunday sent Little Erika and Paul Brandt running for the hills and screaming at the top of their lungs. Erika, 4, and Paul, 6, apparently are not used to the site, smell, or texture of Grandma’s cold plum soup.
“Ach, those children yet! All they want is Oreo cookies,” exclaimed Grandma Brandt. “I tried to sit them down on my lap and spoon it into them, but they were having none of it.”
The fact that Grandma’s plumi moos closely resembles the sludge that Mom pulls from the bathroom sink every other week was a determining factor in Erika and Paul’s reluctance to try it.
“I know it doesn’t look like much, but once they try it I’m sure they’d be hooked,” said Grandma. “If only I could trick them into trying it somehow.”
Grandma then sprayed an entire can of Cool Whip onto the plumi moos and handed each child a bowl.
“At first they were very excited, but as soon as they got past the imitation whipped topping, the crying started up again,” said Grandma. “I’m really at my wit’s end with these two.”
Grandma Brandt is especially concerned because the local Mennonite church will not allow them membership unless they learn to stomach plumi moos.
“They’ve still got a few years to acquire a taste,” said Grandma. “But by the time they’ve learned their catechism they’ve got to be able to down a bowl of this stuff. Otherwise they’ll never get baptized and never get married!”

Rare Patch of Smooth Road Discovered in Winnipeg,"WINNIPEG, MB
Mr. Thiessen of North Kildonan was utterly shocked to discover a short patch of completely smooth road in Winnipeg during a visit to the Linden Woods neighbourhood this weekend.
“What the hell is this?” yelled Mr. Thiessen, slamming on his breaks. “I wasn’t sure my vehicle could handle freshly poured concrete, so I slowed right down to 20. I’m just not used to these road conditions.”
The brief jaunt down the smooth patch of street was a real treat for Mr. Thiessen, one that he had not experienced since a trip to Calgary back in the 80s.
“I finally made it through the third track of that Bill Gaither album without the CD skipping,” said Thiessen. “This truly is the best day of my life!”

Dating Couple Finds Convenient Loophole in Purity Pledge,"HARRISONBURG, VA
College juniors, Matt Lewis and Bethany Lehman, are among thousands of American young people to sign pledges committing themselves to “remain pure until marriage.” Luckily for the newly dating couple, however, they were able to find a number of convenient loopholes in the pledge.
“I won’t get into specifics,” said Matt, “as I don’t want to be a stumbling block to other couples, but let’s just say we discovered a few things that will keep us satisfied until we get married sometime after we graduate in 2019…or at least until I find a girl who’s a little more liberal when it comes to this sort of thing.”
Matt and Bethany are concerned about preserving themselves for marriage, just so long as it doesn’t impede on their surging and insatiable appetite for each other.
“When I get married, I want to be able to say to my husband, who may or may not be Matt, that I did everything in my power to uphold the purity pledge I made under great duress during my first year of college,” explained Bethany. “Luckily there are at least fifteen positions in the Kama Sutra that are not specifically mentioned in the pledge.”
Dr. Henry Sellinger, founder of the Purity League of America, regrets the purity pledge error, and suggests that couples like them may be missing the point.
“We never should have given them a list in the first place,” he says. “For one thing, I think it gave some people ideas…and the rest of them figured the list was exhaustive and scoured the Internet for moves we might have missed.”

Last Church in Town Finally Drops ‘Cumbersome Mennonite Label’,"KLEINFELD, SK
In the 1920s, the small town of Kleinfeld had more than a dozen Mennonite churches of various shapes and sizes. In 2018, all the churches are still around, though over the years most of them have dropped the ‘Mennonite’ label fearing it would alienate newcomers.
“The EMBBC church was the last hold-out,” said Pastor Bob. “But we figured it was finally time to get rid of the cumbersome Mennonite label and just go with the flow. From now on we’ll be known as the West Eastside Kleinfeld Evangelical Bible Gospel Fellowship Church.”
Pastor Bob says he was sick and tired of losing members to all the other churches in town that dropped the Mennonite label years ago.
“If you want to attract young people, you’ve got to be willing to toss out a few core components of your belief system such as peace, non-conformity, and the separation of church and state,” said Pastor Bob. “Those sorts of ideas just don’t mean anything to the people of today, so why bother with that Mennonite label?”
Most of the churches in town, including The God Zone and Agape World, have completely thrown Mennonite doctrine by the wayside when they made the name change.
“I’m not sure how we’re going to win back all those people who left us,” said Pastor Bob. “But I’m absolutely certain that dropping the word ‘Mennonite’ is a key element of that strategy.”
In reaction to the news, more than half a dozen Kleinfeld churches have decided to revert to calling themselves “Mennonite” because apparently that’s the cool thing right now.

Adorable Mennonite Child Becomes Millionaire Selling Chocolates to Old People,"SOUTH BLUMENORT, MB
6-year-old Anna Berg of South Blumenort has become the region’s latest millionaire after selling a record number of chocolate-covered almonds to area seniors. While Mennonites have the reputation for being rather frugal, that all seems to fall apart when there’s a cute kid involved.
“They won’t tip and they buy everything second hand, but put a little girl in pigtails in front of them and they’re quick to open their chequebooks,” said Anna’s mother Ruth. “I even taught Anna a few words of Plautdietsch. The seniors were sea impressed.”
It took Anna just four days to rack up a million dollars in sales, after hitting up all the local senior’s homes. Everywhere she went, it seems, she drew quite the crowd.
“They pinched her cheeks, ruffled up her hair, and told long-winded stories about the old country,” said Mrs. Berg. “But Anna says it was all worth it to sell those chocolates!”
The pièce de résistance, however, was Anna’s performance of “Edelweiss” from The Sound of Music.
“Oh my gosh! After that the seniors were buying chocolates like there’s no tomorrow,” said Mrs. Berg. “It’s no wonder she’s a millionaire. Her performance is absolutely irresistible!”
All of the seniors say they plan to just suck off the chocolate and leave the almonds in a bowl for when they have visitors.",NaN,"March 25, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/chocolates-1-e1521927533709.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonite Woman Snags Best License Plate Ever! (This is real!),"SANFORD, MB
It isn’t often that the Daily Bonnet reports on something real, but here is a rare exception that was too good to pass up. Earlier today, Jennifer Wiebe of Sanford, Manitoba sent me this picture of her brand new license plate: HYM 606.
Jennifer purchased a vehicle at a dealership just outside the perimeter of Winnipeg and was told they were handing out license plates in the HYM 590s.
“She said I could pick whatever number I wanted,” said Wiebe, “and I joked that if I could only get HYM 606.”
And, lo and behold, that number was available. The woman working there was not Mennonite and had no idea why Jennifer had selected this number. But we all know!
The great thing is, as Jennifer pointed out, the license plate is NOT a vanity plate. She paid nothing extra for it.
“Obviously, as what self-respecting Mennonite would spend that extra money on something so frivolous?”

Stubborn Mennonite Man Refuses to Change Dead Bulb,"GOSHEN, IN
A 40 watt lightbulb that burned out in March 1987 has remained in the ceiling of a Goshen area home for more than thirty years after Mr. Hochstetter, 69, adamantly refused to change it. When they moved in, the home came equipped with numerous lightbulbs, but since purchasing the lovely bungalow, the family patriarch has not replaced a single one.
“Change? Change? Everyone’s talking about change these days. Well, I for one, absolutely refuse!” exclaimed Hochstetter. “It’s a slippery slope. It always starts with the lightbulbs. Then we’re marrying our pets. These progressives have got to be stopped!”
Mrs. Hochstetter has kindly suggested on numerous occasions that her husband replace the bulb but, so far, to no avail.
“I don’t know about that woman. Always pushing for change. ‘Change the lightbulb, Henry.’ ‘Change your underwear, Henry,’ she says,” said Mr. Hochstetter. “I had no idea I married such a flaming liberal.”
Mr. Hochstetter did allow the family to use candles for a brief time after all the bulbs burned out, but once those dwindled to nothing, they’ve been stuck in the dark ever since.
“I like it in the dark,” he said. “If you refuse to change, you have to get used to it.”

Rhubarb-Flavoured Vaping All the Rage in Mennonite Country,"WINKLER, MB
Mennonites across the Pembina Valley have been swapping out their cigarettes and yerba tea for rhubarb-flavoured e-cigarettes. Health officials, however, worry the trend might catch on with non-smokers as well.
“Oba, when they start offering flavours that appeal to Mennonites, I start to get worried,” said Dr. Peters. “They’ve got three different variations on rhubarb alone: raw rhubarb, rhubarb dipped in sugar, and rhubarb platz. I’m really concerned about the impact this will have on our Mennonite young people.”
Seven Mennonite youngsters were caught vaping behind the old Friesen barn on Friday night.
“And they were doing the straight raw rhubarb flavour!” proclaimed Peters. “What is this world coming to? That stuff is so sour! It’s the harshest stuff!”
Health authorities warn Mennonites that e-cigarettes have the same health risks as regular cigarettes.
“Just because it tastes like grandma’s strawberry rhubarb pie doesn’t mean it’s safe to smoke,” said Peters. “I’m just glad they haven’t invented a waffle with white sauce-flavoured vape.”
Of additional concern to health workers is the fact that the puckered faces caused by the tart flavour of the rhubarb apparently cause a higher percentage of smoke to be drawn into the lungs.
“If you’re going to smoke rhubarb, at least have it with platz,” said Peters. “I wish people would abstain altogether, but I know no one can resist a good hit of rhubarb every now and then.”

Wild Night Ensues After Mennonite Woman Spikes Schoofly Pie,"LANCASTER, PA
Mrs. Miller’s rum-soaked schoofly pie was a big hit at the church coffee and dessert event this past Sunday, as Mennonite seniors went back for seconds, thirds, and, in some cases, even fourths.
“I didn’t tell them what was in it, of course. That will be our little secret,” said Mrs. Miller. “I just wanted to spice things up a little bit.”
Mrs. Miller spent all weekend baking and brought ten drunken schoofly pies to the event.
“I had a suspicion it was going to be popular,” said Mrs. Miller. “And, boy, was I ever right. I’ve never seen anything like it!”
After a few pieces of pie, the seniors started to get a little frisky, and at the end of the evening Mr. Stoltzfus was seen leaving with Mrs. Kreider and Mrs. Kennel was seen hoping into a car with one of the Troyer brothers.
“Schoofly pie can have that effect on people at the best of times,” explained Mrs. Miller. “When you pour a little rum into the mix, it only enhances the effect.”
Pastor Johan gave a thunderous sermon against schoofly pie the very next Sunday, though Mrs. Miller says she was stopped numerous times in the lobby after church with requests for her recipe.

A Do-it-Yourselfers Guide to Selecting and Constructing the Perfect Border Wall,"Spring is the perfect time to think about upcoming projects around the house. Whether it’s restaining the deck or sweeping out the garage, I’m sure your list is pretty long. But there’s one item that any home-owner should not forget: selecting and constructing a twenty-foot high wall around your property. The neighbours are always coming over without an invite and the border wall is a simple solution to the Friesen problem. Border walls are the hottest home and garden trend for 2018 and there’s no reason a handyman or woman like yourself can’t get one constructed over the weekend. So follow our simple steps and even a novice do-it-yourselfer should have their property well protected just in time for BBQ season!
Step 1: Measure out your property in ice cream pails. T.S. Eliot once said he had “measured out (his) life with coffee spoons.” You’re welcome to use coffee spoons if you wish, but the preferred Mennonite method is ice cream pails. Once you know how many ice cream pails long and wide your property is, you’ll be able to be able to bring these figures to your local hardware store. Ask for Abe – he’ll take it from there.
Step 2: Buy a sufficient quantity of mud bricks. Abe will easily be able to tell you how many you need. It’s going to be a lot, so you’ll need to borrow your cousin Corny’s truck and maybe your cousin Jakob’s also. They might ask you for some payment, but just remind them about the favour they owe you. (That time you caught them with the Loewen sisters behind the barn and didn’t tell the elders).
Step 3: Buy lots of yerba tea. Building a border wall around your property is hard work and you’re going to need nourishment. Yerba tea is the best thing for a hard working Mennonite man! The women can drink Papsi.
Step 4: Stake out the path. You don’t want the wall going straight through Mrs. Reimer’s petunias, so make sure to carefully map it all out. Remember what they always say: measure twice, brick out the Friesens once.
Step 4: Get your Hinjarenj in gear. It’s a lot of work building a twenty foot tall wall around your property, unless you’re a city Mennonite with one of those tiny Winnipeg properties, then you should be able to get it all done in an afternoon. But for the real Mennonites out there, it may take you a while, so you’re going to have to forego the knackzoat and work your butt off. It’ll all be worth it to keep the Friesens out.
Step 5: Allow the bricks to harden before setting the sheep free. There’s nothing worse for border walls than sheep urine. Keep them penned up in the kitchen or little Nettie’s room until the bricks have hardened. Once you’re certain the wall can withstand the forceful spray of the sheep (and also cousin Peter), then let ‘er rip.
Step 6: Enjoy your wall. It’s your wall. You built it. Enjoy the view! Watch out for tunnels, though. Those Friesens are a shifty bunch.

Mennonite Pickle Juice Used to Preserve Vladimir Lenin’s Body,"MOSCOW, RUSSIA
The body of Soviet dictator Vladimir Lenin has been preserved in a Moscow mausoleum since his death in 1924. While many have speculated as to the methods used to keep the body in tip-top shape, Kremlin sources have recently disclosed the method: Mennonite pickle juice.
“12 cups water, 2 cups vinegar, 3/4 cup pickling salt, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 heaping tablespoon pickling spice,” explained government spokesperson Dmitri Abrikosov. “I don’t know why everyone thought Lenin’s preservation was such a mystery. You can get the recipe in the Mennonite Treasury and try it yourself. It’s really quite easy.”
Russian scientists threw in a bit of garlic during the Kruschev years, but since the end of the Soviet era, it’s been a very basic recipe.
“You can preserve anything in this. As long as you precook and use fresh, sound firm products, you should be fine,” said Abrikosov. “You know the jar is sealed when you hear that pop!”
Members of the Mennonite community were shocked at the revelation.
“I don’t like the idea of our precious pickle juice being used to preserve Lenin,” said Mrs. Neufeld. “I guess it’s like Einstein and splitting the atom. You come up with an idea and then someone takes it and uses it for evil.”
Russian authorities reportedly re-pickle Lenin’s body every six months so that it stays fresh.

Mennonite Couple Faces Barrage of Questions After Wife Pulls Up to Church in the Driver’s Seat,"OSLER, SK
Mr. and Mrs. George and Aggie Brandt of Osler were held for questioning by the church board this week after pulling onto the parking lot of South Osler Mennonite with Aggie at the helm of their ’97 Taurus.
“What on earth were they thinking?” wondered Elder Krahn. “We haven’t seen this blatant disregard for the spiritual health of the congregation since Mrs. Wiebe wore flared pants to church back in the late 70s.”
Aggie just happened to grab the car keys that Sunday, but the congregation was certain her position behind the wheel meant grave things about the condition of their marriage.
“Was George sick? Was he somehow incapacitated?” pondered Krahn. “I can’t find any scriptural basis for women to take the leadership role in a marriage like this. It’s highly disturbing and I hope it’s not a sign of things to come.”
There was much questioning of George’s manhood and discussion about “who was wearing the pants” in the Brandt family. There were also some very strong suggestions that the couple go for counselling.
“If Pastor Dave’s marriage classes don’t fix this problem, there’s no hope for those Brandts,” said Krahn. “We haven’t had a woman drive onto the parking lot in the entire history of our church. I’m also really disappointed that George signed off on Aggie’s driver’s license.”
The congregation was so perturbed by the sight of a woman driving, that they voted overwhelmingly to go back to horse-and-buggy, provided that it was a man with the reins in his hands.
“Pants, driving, speaking of their own volition? What is the word coming to?” said Krahn. “The Devil sure puts crazy ideas into women’s heads sometimes.”

Mennonite Pastor Hides Geocache in Church to Attract New Members,"AKRON, PA
In an attempt to be more “missional” and attract new members, Pastor Dave of West Akron Mennonite planted five cleverly hidden geocaches in his church this past Sunday.
“It worked out great. We had people trickling in with their GPS’s throughout the service. Some even left a couple bucks in the offering plate,” said Dave. “One couple came all the way from Allentown to find the geocache jammed into the cushions in a sofa in the youth room. Seemed liked a nice couple. I hope they’ll be back next week.”
After seven schisms within the last two years, West Akron has struggled to keep the doors open, but Pastor Dave plans to hide new geocaches in different locations throughout the sanctuary to keep them coming.
“It doesn’t matter what makes them walk through these doors,” said Dave. “Once they’re here, we cram them full of schoolfy pie and sign them up for a mid-week Bible study. I can’t believe I didn’t think of this idea sooner.”
The items inside Dave’s geocaches have included an old hymnal, a copy of Martyr’s Mirror, and a 6-pack of Diet Pepsi.
“The attendance was up last week,” said Dave. “It was a bit weird to have people rummaging around and peering beneath the pews while we’re trying to sing 606, but we’re a welcoming church so no one seemed to mind.”
The West Akron Mennonite Church is located at N 40° 09.523 W 076° 11.869.

Choir Director Admits He Really Doesn’t Know What the Heck He’s Doing with His Arms,"SASKATOON, SK
Mr. Peter Friesen, choir director at Third Mennonite Church in Saskatoon, admitted in a candid interview this past week that he’s basically just standing up there and flailing his arms about randomly.
“It’s all meaningless,” confessed Friesen. “I move them up, I move them down, I pinch together my fingers. None of it means anything. The choir knows what to do…”
Friesen has been known to occasionally turn around and attempt to direct the congregation in the singing of a hymn, but admits that this too is just an act.
“I’ve got no control over those people,” said Friesen. “I mean my arms go up and Mrs. Reimer goes into falsetto. My arms go down and Mr. Fehr sings the echo part. It’s absolute chaos.”
Friesen said he’s taken a few moves from air traffic controllers, while others he’s learned while eavesdropping on his wife’s yoga DVDs.
“I get inspiration from everywhere,” said Friesen, “but let me tell you, I’m certain I’m not the only one up there faking it on Sunday morning. You really think that kid in the skinny jeans doing the Praise and Worship songs knows what he’s doing?”
Inspired by Mr. Friesen’s frankness, Pastor Dave also admitted that his Sunday morning pulpit-pounding was just for show.

5 Alcoholic Beverages You Can Easily Sneak Past the Elders,"Mennonite elders aren’t usually too keen on drinking, and even though they’ve got no Scripture to back it up, they punish offenders very severely for even the slightest infraction. For example, just last week, Mrs. Unger was made to scrub down kitchen floors for every member of the board after Elder Krahn smelled a bit of mouthwash on her breath.
But with a bit of knowhow and an ounce of courage, there are ways of getting around these rules. Here are five beverages you can easily sneak past the elders.





As always, please closet-drink responsibly.

Area Man Manages to Keep Windshield Clean for a Record Five Minutes,"GIMLI, MB
Local man Olaf Einarrson, 47, of Gimli, managed to keep the windshield of his Honda Odyssey relatively clean for almost a full five minutes this morning. Although not officially confirmed, many are saying this is a record for the Manitoba melting season.
“Maintaining visibility through a windshield for five minutes is next to impossible this time of year,” said Einarrson. “But I’ve got a trunk full of washer fluid and a determination to set the record!”
Einarsson did have to pull over every hundred feet or so, but says it was well worth it to get to work safely.
“I went through fifteen containers of washer fluid on the way to work this morning,” said Einarrson. “My wife went through seven bottles of her own…and she walks.”
In March as the snow melts, all Manitoba vehicles accumulate a thick impenetrable layer of road grime, which reduces visibility and makes even the most aesthetically appealing of cars look completely ugly.
“Once I ran out of fluid, I pulled over, scooped up some snow, and managed to clear away a small section on the windshield just large enough for me to peer through,” said Einarrson. “Thankfully I made it to work without incident.”

Judge Sentences Katy Perry to Kiss 100 Random Mennonite Dudes,"HOLLYWOOD, CA
After kissing a disinterested young man on American Idol this week, pop star Katy Perry has been sentenced to make out with 100 hairy Mennonite guys in suspenders and dirty rubber boots.
“It sounds pretty harsh, but I think the judge made the right decision here,” said prosecuting attorney, Peter Janzen. “Kissing a Mennonite man is the strictest punishment we have in the State of California.”
Perry’s lawyers tried to claim this was “cruel and unusual punishment” but, in the end, the judge said the punishment fit the crime.
“We’ll see how she feels about kissing people against their will after she’s done with these gruffy farmers,” said the judge. “I’m pretty certain Ms. Perry will be a lot more selective about her kissing partners in the future.”
The 100 Mennonite men will be selected at random for Perry Duty, and experts say their beards will be examined for maximum prickliness.
“The chafing is going to be pretty bad, not to mention the cold sores,” said Janzen. “Just ask any Mennonite woman. It ain’t pretty kissing a Mennonite man.”
Katy Perry says she’s never kissed a Mennonite before and doesn’t yet know if she’ll like it. However, she does admit to making out with a Hutterite guy on a dare back in her wild college days.

Google Maps Error Leads Rosenort Couple to Southland Mall in Winkler,"WINKLER, MB
The Wiebe family of Rosenort were excited to take the trip out to Steinbach to hear Brother Yun speak at a local church, but after entering the location into Google Maps, the family was led an hour in the wrong direction to a mall in Winkler instead.
“It was the wrong Southland,” said Mr. Wiebe. “And the worst thing is the Southland in Winkler is not even open on Sundays!”
Miles from home and with nowhere to worship, or even to shop, the Wiebes decided to zip over the border to Grand Forks for the day.
“We figured since we were so close, we’d just hop on down to North Dakota and check out that Columbia Mall everyone’s been raving about,” said Mr. Wiebe. “It’s been three days now, and it still keeps telling us to head south.”
After a marathon of driving that led them all the way through Central America, the Wiebes were spotted early this morning at the Panama-Colombia border.
“I’ve heard this is a great place to shop,” said Wiebe, handing his passport to the officer. “It’s a little out of the way, though.”
Colombian border guards say this is not the first time an unwitting Canadian couple has shown up at their border expecting Chick-fil-a and JC Penny, while managers at the Southland Mall in Winkler estimate that 30-40% of their business comes from people trying to get to church in Steinbach.",NaN,"March 15, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winkler.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonites Buy Naming Rights to New Edmonton Arena,"EDMONTON, AB
A group of wealthy Mennonites have honoured their favourite summer treat by purchasing the naming rights to the downtown Edmonton arena. Beginning today, the Oilers’ arena will officially be known as Rogers Golden Syrup Place.
“We’re also replacing all the hot dogs with formavorscht schnetke and the beer with Welch’s grape juice,” said new arena sponsor Fred Reimer. “It’s going to be quite the experience, let me tell you!”
The Oilers take on the San Jose Sharks tonight, and many of the players found the new name a bit of a distraction.
“Here I am in practice trying to improve our penalty kill and all I can think about is roll kuchen,” said team captain Connor McDavid. “I really wish they would have waited until the summer to unveil the new name. I mean, how do they expect us to concentrate on hockey when we’ve got Rogers Golden Syrup on the brain?”
On average, Mennonites consume more than 37 litres of Rogers Golden Syrup per week, though this figure increases dramatically during the hot summer months.
“We considered other names, too,” said Reimer, “but ‘Watermelon and Roll Kuchen Place’ just didn’t have the same ring to it.”
The group says they plan to host quilting bees, gospel quartet concerts, and MCC conventions at the arena in the off-season.

A List of Things Erroneously Blamed on Violent Video Games,"Even though there is absolutely no evidence to back up these claims, politicians across the United States have been clamouring to blame violent video games on the increasing violent behaviour in American society. It’s a red herring, to be sure – a distraction from real problems and real sources of violence.

Mathematicians Confounded as Hockey Player Successfully Gives 110%,"DAUPHIN, MB
Mathematicians across the globe were shocked to discover a junior hockey player in Dauphin, Manitoba giving a full 110% during a game against Virden on Friday night.
“I can’t believe it. Prior to young Colin Goossen’s performance this week, we had always assumed that 100% was the maximum effort any individual could give,” said Professor Bolton of the University of Manitoba. “But after watching Goossen hustle and block shots and get in there on the forecheck, I am now convinced it actually is possible to give 110%.”
Goossen picked up one goal, three assists, and two blocked shots on Friday, but it’s his effort, which was a full 10% higher than ever previously recorded, that had mathematicians baffled.
“You know hockey players always say they’re giving 110% and we never believe them,” said Bolton. “Well this young Dauphin Kings star has proven us all wrong!”
After the match Goossen was awarded with a Player of the Game trophy, which was slightly larger than normal.
“It’s a real honour to get this trophy, but you know hockey is a team game and I couldn’t do this without all my team-mates,” said Goossen. “I guess I just got a lucky bounce or two. But all the credit goes to the training staff, coaches, and the rest of the team.”
Scientists are frantically analyzing Goossen’s cliche-riddled speech to see if this was the first time a hockey player ever said these things and actually meant them.

A Modest Proposal for the Elimination of Faspa,"BY: JOHAN SIEMENS
It is a melancholy object to walk the streets of Steinbach on a Sunday afternoon, to find church after church crowded with Mennonites of various denominations sitting at round tables and consuming nothing more than a few dill pickles and a couple slices of marble cheese. These poor mortals, rather than being able to consume a full meal, are forced to subsist for the entire day on something called “faspa,” a meagre meal – if, indeed, we can even use such a term – that is wholly insufficient to nourish and sustain an individual, even on a Sunday. It is true that some rare families are fortunate enough to supplement the cheese and pickles with raisin buns and cold cuts, but they too are left wanting. At the terminus of faspa, Mennonite families, whether MB or GC or even EMC, are left as hungry as when they began, having approached nowhere near the level of refreshment required to sustain life.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is, indeed, a grave problem throughout Mennonite country. As a respected church elder and used car dealer, I have been asked to employee my thoughts as to how the problem of faspa could be solved. Having seriously considered the options offered by others, I have always found them inadequate. It is true that a raisin bun can support a growing child for half an hour or perhaps a little more, and a few pickles will tie you over between meals, but to suggest, as my opponents have, that “faspa is sufficient” is beyond laughable. No, my friends, faspa is not a real meal.
Whoever, therefore, could derive a plan to eliminate the meal of faspa, and offer a better, would be held with such regard in the Mennonite community that a diminutive plaque should be placed in his honour at the Jake Epp Library.
It has been brought to my attention by a knowing acquaintance of mine in Winnipeg that Englishers, who believe as strongly as we do that Sunday ought to be a day of rest, tend to consume large quantities of a baked flatbread known as “pizza.” Rather than bake it themselves, these Englishers use a device known as a “telephone” and within a short period of time the pizza arrives at their door ready to be consumed by the famished residents of the city. My Winnipeg friend assures me, from frequent experience, that this “pizza” is, whether hot or eaten cold the next day, a wholesome and nourishing food and may well be suited for the needs of Mennonites as well.
With humble submission, I do therefore offer it to consideration that faspa, which is well known to be unsatisfactory fare at its best, be replaced with the Englisher food known as “pizza.”
Telephones could be installed in each of our homes and connected to a series of cables that would allow us direct communication with the makers of pizza. As for the cold cuts and raisin buns already in the church freezer – these could be taken out and used as snacks during youth programs, Bible studies, or rambling protracted sermons. So long as they do not masquerade as a meal, there is no need to eliminate them completely. Pizza comes in a variety of flavours and a knowing chef, who understands how to oblige a hungry Mennonite, will make it as large and full of carnivorous toppings as they please.
The reasons for my proposal are many. For one, it will greatly reduce the destruction of pickles, alas, too frequent at our tables. Secondly, it will finally provide adequate nourishment to our starving men, thus readying them for rock-picking and manure-shoveling in the week to come. Thirdly, the women, who had previously spent days pickling cucumbers and rolling up ham slices in preparation for faspa, will be free to finally finish the quilts they had been working on for years. Fourth, we should see an honest emulation among the unmarried men, which one of them could eat the most slices of pizza, a competition, which would bring pleasure and, I might add, some degree of healthy amusement to our usually stoic Sunday afternoon lunches. Fifthly, having discovered pizza in the city, many of our young people leave and never return to Reinland. Thus, this proposal, would dramatically reduce the exodus to Winnipeg and bring a vibrancy to our rural communities not seen since the Great Platz Revival of ’38.
I beseech you, ladies and gentlemen, to prayerfully consider my modest proposal. The elimination of faspa and the replacement of said meal with pizza is of utmost importance for the longterm physical and spiritual health of our people.

Liquor Store Undergoes Expansion; Now the Largest Church in Town,"ALT-BERGFELD, MB
After a massive expansion to the local liquor store, residents of a small Mennonite town are now admitting that it’s the “largest church in town.”
“More people stop by to pick up a two-four of Molson Canadian every weekend than go to church on Sunday,” said area farmer Billy Friesen. “I mean last Sunday I think the Friesens and Duecks were the only ones there.”
Friesen also acknowledges that there were a few Walls and Hildebrandts in attendance as well but, overall, this pales in comparison to the volume of traffic through the newly expanded liquor store.
“I thought our church expansion back in ’87 was big,” says Friesen. “We got a gymnasium and a brand new lobby, but now the liquor store has got us beat.”
Friesen says he hopes the tide will turn and restore Alt-Bergfeld MBCM to its rightful position as the largest most powerful church in town, but is not too optimistic for the near future.
“Everyone worships,” says Friesen. “The opium of the masses isn’t always religion. Sometimes it’s actually, you know, opium…or maybe even Bud Light.”

Daily Bonnet Launches New Satire Site for the Hypersensitive and Easily Offended,"STEINBACH, MB
For almost two years The Daily Bonnet has brought mildly biting satire into Mennonite homes across the globe. Now the creators of the Daily Bonnet have launched an all new website that features blatant plagiarism from The Daily Bread devotional guide. The hope is this new site will be acceptable to even the most hypersensitive and easily offended of people.
“We found there were some people who just couldn’t stomach jokes about schmaunt fat, Tide Pods, and socks with sandals,” said Daily Bonnet founder Andrew J. Bergman. “So, we’ve decided to tone things down a little. Not only will the content be utterly innocuous, but we’re also providing each email subscriber with a monthly supply of Kleenex just in case, despite our efforts to avoid offence, they still break down in tears.”
The new site will feature pleasant and comforting devotionals, each with an amusing anecdote by a local pastor. The new posts will also include a verse from the least edgy parts of the Bible.
“It’s the sort of material even your Taunte Liza could enjoy. Frankly, I’m not comfortable getting into the Song of Solomon or most of Leviticus. That’s bound to upset someone,” said Bergman. “We’ll just stick to the Beatitudes and the pleasant parts of the Psalms.”
The new site will reward readers with gold stickers every time they read an article all the way through without being deeply and personally offended.
However, not everyone liked the idea.

Documentary “The Shape of Water” Tells the Story of a Mennonite Woman and Her Husband Abe,"HOLLYWOOD, CA
The big winner at the Oscars this year was Guillermo del Toro’s documentary The Shape of Water, which tells the tale of a passionate romance between a Mennonite woman named Helen Elias and a hideous fish-like creature named Abe.
“I think a lot of Mennonite women out there will be able to relate,” said the real-life Mrs. Elias. “I mean, I’m sure I’m not the only one to look at my husband sitting on the couch in his tighty-whiteys, scratching himself, and think, ‘Oba, Helen, just what were you thinking?'”
The Shape of Water, also known as The Creature from the Blumenort Lagoon, features a number of lush sensuous scenes between Mrs. Elias and her amphibian husband, though the theme of the film is that love can transcend such differences.
“Just because Abe eats a little too much vereniki and refuses to groom properly, doesn’t mean that we can’t lock the bathroom door on Sunday afternoons and fill the room with water for our peculiar romantic adventures,” said Elias. “Who are you to judge us?”
Elias says there are many men like Abe out there and they shouldn’t be overlooked just because they spend a lot of time grunting and not a lot of time on their fingernails.
“There are certain things you’ll have to put up with if you want a Mennonite man,” said Elias. “But I hope our little film will show people that sometimes even a Mennonite man can find love.”",NaN,"March 8, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blacklagoon.jpg?resize=600%2C381,Fake
Ozzy Osbourne Signs Petition Against US Metal Tariffs,"BEVERLY HILLS, CA
Legendary English rocker Ozzy Osbourne added his name to a petition that seeks to end the Trump Administration’s proposed metal tariffs. The new law is intended to protect American metal such as Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer while imposing heavy taxes on foreign metal such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Opeth.
“Maybe I’m a little paranoid, but I’m really suspicious of any restrictions on the free and open trade of metal,” said Osbourne from his Beverly Hills mansion. “Metal is a universal language that transcends national and geographic boundaries. I’m outraged that the White House would try to stop the spread of foreign metal!”
The new metal tariffs will hit the British and Scandinavian metal scene the hardest.
“I’ve heard they’re going to tax black t-shirts and pentagrams,” said an outraged local metal fan Darrel McGunnarson, who also added his name to the petition, despite pleading from his wife to stay out of it. “This is the worst news I’ve heard since the breakup of Pantera!”
It is not known how the metal tariffs will affect Canadian and Mexican metal, and at press time Annihalator and Brujeria were unavailable for comment. Rumours continue to surface, however, that the new trade laws may prevent the importation of stage blood and live bats.

Jets Fans Toss Amish Hats onto the Ice to Celebrate Patrik Laine’s Hat Trick,"NEW YORK, NY
There were more than a few Winnipeg Jets fans at Madison Square Gardens last night to witness the young Finnish superstar, and wanna-Anabaptist, Patrik Laine score three goals against the lowly Rangers. In honour of Laine’s growing interest in all things Mennonite and Amish, Jets fans threw black Amish hats onto the ice.
“What a game,” exclaimed excited Jets fan Peter Berg. “A hat trick for Patrik! Good thing we stopped in rural Pennsylvania on the drive down here!”
The ice was littered with black Amish hats after Patrik Laine plunked the puck into the empty net late in the third period.
“I’ve always wanted one of these hats,” said Laine after the game. “I’ve already got the beard. Now all I need is a nice pair of suspenders.”
Jets fans promised to toss suspenders onto the ice the next time Laine scores a hat trick.
“If he wants suspenders, we’ll give him suspenders. If he wants rubber boots, I’ll give him some. Heck, if Patrik Laine wants me to toss him my King James Bible or Mennonite hymnaI I’ll do that, too,” said Berg. “All I ask in return is a Stanley Cup.”

Oscar Host Jimmy Kimmel Stolen at After Party,"HOLLYWOOD, CA
It seems security was more relaxed than usual at Oscar after-parties this week. Just moments after Best Actress winner Frances McDormand’s trophy was stolen, Academy Awards host Jimmy Kimmel was also reported missing.
“I just set him down for a moment to grab a cocktail,” said Kimmel’s wife Molly. “And then when I turned around, he was gone! Someone must have swiped him.”
When boiled all down and sold for scrap metal, experts estimate that Jimmy Kimmel is worth just $900, though the street value may be higher.
“We’re asking the public to keep an eye out for a sarcastic bearded man in his early 50s,” say Hollywood police. “Oh, and if you can find Frances McDormand’s Oscar trophy, that would be nice, too.”
This is not the first time an Oscar host has been stolen. Records indicate that Bob Hope was stolen in 1967 by drugged-out hippies, and Billy Crystal was stolen in 1998 in an attempt to prevent him from doing any more movies. Both hosts were later returned with only minor scratches.
“As it turns out, Oscar hosts don’t sell for much on eBay,” said Officer Warlow. “We sure hope the culprits will come forward and return Jimmy Kimmel to his rightful owner.”
In other news, Jimmy Kimmel is being accused by Stephen Colbert of stealing all his jokes.

Justin Trudeau Makes Official Visit to Mennonite Church Wearing Rubber Boots and Suspenders,"ALTONA, MB
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau brought along an entourage of more than three hundred people to the small Mennonite town of Altona, Manitoba this past week and out of respect for the local culture, each one of them was sporting traditional Mennonite attire.
“I didn’t have time to grow out my beard, but I did manage to pick up a pair of suspenders and rubber boots at the local K-Mart,” explained Trudeau. “And you should see Sophie in her flower dress and rollerblades. Stunning!”
The Prime Minister and the rest of his crew stayed just long enough to hear the end of Pastor Johan sermon on humility, before joining the congregation in a rousing rendition of “The Church in the Wildwood.”
“I spent the entire service with my thumb tucked behind my suspenders just like the Mennonites do in the pictures I’ve seen,” said Trudeau. “Sophie and I even asked the kids to teach us some words of Plautdietsch. What exactly does ‘schmock heena been‘ mean again?”
The visit ended with a brief faspa in the church basement, where the Prime Minister spoke with the locals about farming, trade, and the price of flax these days.
“This trade mission to Altona will be quite the boon to our two nations,” said Trudeau. “Any time I can leave a place with an ice cream pail full of molasses cookies is a success in my books.”
Altona EMB church members were delighted at the presence of the Prime Minister, but hoped that next time he’d scape the mud off his boots at the door.

Single Snowflake Causes Vancouver Schools to Shut Down for ‘Snow Day’,"VANCOUVER, BC
The discovery of a single solitary snowflake in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby this Monday, forced schools across the region to shut down. The sighting was reported early Monday morning and immediately caused a panic throughout the region.
“The kids are happy about it. They’re all clamouring for space to go sledding on the snowflake,” said Vancouver Public Safety Administrator I.M. Friesen. “However, it’s sure wreaking havoc on our infrastructure. We didn’t budget for snow-clearing this year.”
The single snowflake was the largest winter storm of the season and as a result of the wintry weather, traffic was backed up for miles on the 7A.
“The morning commute was horrible,” said Friesen. “Vancouver drivers simply aren’t used to these kind of harsh driving conditions. It’s a good thing they closed the schools.”
Vancouver residents were quick to take selfies with the snowflake and post them on Facebook and Instagram.
“I want to show all my relatives in Manitoba what Vancouver winters really are like,” said Miss Wiebe, sporting a Canada Goose parka and huge clunky Sorel boots. “You know we’re not as fragile as everyone on the Prairies thinks we are.”

Mennonite Church Bans ‘Roll Up the Rim’ as Gambling,"CHILLIWACK, BC
The South Chilliwack Gospel Mennonite Church has banned members from rolling up the rim at Tim Hortons, as it violates the church’s strict teaching against games of chance. The church took the action after catching more than a dozen church-goers, including two members of the deacon board, checking their coffee rims in the lobby after the service this Sunday.
“Jauma lied! And in the church lobby yet!” yelled Elder Krahn, seizing the Tim Hortons cups from the hapless coffee drinkers. “This is a house of worship, not a gambling den!”
Krahn told reporters that he confiscated the coffee cups as a preventative measure.
“I’m keeping them from sin,” said Krahn. “As long as they don’t claim their free donuts and coffees they haven’t technically done anything wrong. It’s only when you collect your prize that you’ve violated the commandment.”
The church-goers claimed ignorance of the rule, and said they would never have so much as rolled up the rim and glanced at the message had they been aware of the dire consequences.
“I guess I was really playing with fire there,” said Mr. Fehr. “I’m grateful to Elder Krahn for leading me to the right path. I’ll never touch a takeaway coffee cup again!”
Krahn also claimed that any more than one sugar and one cream was a violation of the sin of gluttony and carefully inspected each coffee to make sure there were no double-doubles.
“It’s hard work keeping everyone else from sinning,” said Krahn. “Thankfully, it’s all over now. Next Sunday I plan on taking these used coffee cups out to the church parking lot for a public prayer and ceremonial burning.”

I know it’s hard to believe, but some of you are getting your own names wrong. Maybe it was an immigration officer who changed it upon entry, or maybe your ancestors wanted to sound more Anglo. Whatever the case, here is way you really should be spelling it according to Elder Goertzen (yes, with a T) in Steinbach.

Raw Farmer Sausage and Vinegar: A Daily Bonnet Recipe,"Whether planning a fancy wedding reception this summer or just a cocktail party at the lake house, you’re going to want to have hors d’oeuvres that leave an impression. Although it takes considerable time and preparation, here is one of our favourite Mennonite hors d’oeuvres. The recipe is rather complex, so be prepared for 2-3 hours of prep time. It’s well worth the effort.
Raw Farmer Sausage and Vinegar
Carefully take the raw farmer sausage out of the refrigerator. Whatever you do, be sure not to cook it or it will no longer be raw! Cut it into bite size pieces. Pour some white vinegar into a small bowl. Sprinkle some vinegar onto the raw farmer sausage and put it into your mouth. Repeat as needed.
(MBs may prefer to fully immerse the raw farmer sausage into the vinegar, rather than just sprinkling or pouring.)
To leave a lasting impression, you may even consider sticking toothpicks into the pieces of raw farmer sausage. Not only are they good for dipping and dunking, but they’ll also be useful for picking the gnurpel out of your teeth afterwards.

Trump Announces Huge Punishing Tariff on Common Sense and Decency,"WASHINGTON, DC
At a press conference at the White House on Friday, the Trump Administration announced a massive new tariff on the basic human values commonly held by the rest of the world. Specifically targeted in the new tariff were foreign imports “including, but not limited to, wisdom, level-headedness, and decency.”
“We’re preserving our American values,” said Trump. “We simply can’t have those foreign ideas of peace, justice, and public safety infect our shores.”
Trump is acting fast as recent months have shown an increase in American young people speaking out and letting their voices be heard on a wide range of issues that would make the USA a better place.
“Where are these people getting these ideas? Look at what free trade has done to our nation!” said Trump. “If you’re going to go around saying ‘our schools should be safer’ or ‘people shouldn’t die on the street because they have no health insurance’ and stuff like that, then you’re going to pay a hefty fine for those foreign ideas.”
With the new protectionist laws, American citizens caught importing and distributing foreign ideas such as universal health care, gun control, and the metric system will be punished with a 10 million dollar fine and could even face jail time in one of America’s many privately-run profit-driven prisons.
“We’re going to rip apart NAFTA piece by piece,” said Trump. “No more Canadian milk, wheat, or values of peace and prosperity for us!”
So far, foreign importers of decent ideas have been undeterred by the threat of tariffs since they’re confident that Americans will buy their products anyway.

Self-Loathing Winnipeggers Select ‘Ugh…Winnipeg Sucks’ as New City Slogan,"WINNIPEG, MB
Winnipeggers have spoken. By a wide margin, locals voted to replace ‘One Great City’ and ‘The Heart of the Continent’ with ‘Ugh….Winnipeg sucks’ as the new city slogan.
“Time and again, what we heard from city residents was that the former slogans did not truly represent the heartfelt emotions of the people,” said referendum organizer Burton Samson. “We feel this new slogan more accurately expresses the self-loathing can’t-do attitude that our fair city is known for.”
Upon hearing the news, popular local blogger @winnipeghater69 took a break from his busy schedule of dissuading potential visitors on the Tourism Winnipeg Facebook page to express his adulation for the snazzy new slogan.
“It’s nice to see the city council finally get something right for a change,” he said. “Now if only they’d do something about those damn potholes.”
On a related note, residents of Calgary, Alberta will be voting this fall whether to change their city slogan to ‘Heaven on Earth…But With Oil’ or ‘Calgary: We’re So Much Better Than You.’

Mennonite Woman Buys Back Her Own Clothes at the MCC Store,"ALTONA, MB
Mrs. Erin Loewen, 38, of Altona donated, then bought back, dozens of blouses, skirts, and denim products from the local MCC Thrift Store this month. She says the buy-backs are not intentional, but “just happen sometimes” when you purchase the volume of second-hand clothes that she does.
“The other day I was at the Altona MCC and discovered this great pair of black skinny jeans…and they fit like a glove. I just had to snatch them up before some other size 28 comes along and snags them!” said Loewen. “When I got them home and tried them in the full length mirror they looked a little familiar. Oh well…”
Loewen donates two garbage bags worth of clothes to the MCC each week, but always makes sure to purchase just as much in return.
“I think of it as a rental shop, without any late fees!” said Loewen. “I knew my old American Apparel gabardine tennis skirt wouldn’t last long so as soon as I saw it on the shelf I bought it right back!”
Loewen can be seen shopping at the Altona MCC between 11 and 2 on Saturdays, and donating everything back on Thursdays during her lunch break.

Mennonite Lady Calls Into ‘Trading Post’ Every Day for Thirty Years,"STEINBACH, MB
Area woman Mrs. L. Brandt has been trying to get rid of her old ironing board on the radio Trading Post for the past three decades.
“I haven’t missed a Trading Post since the mid 1980s,” explained Brandt. “Still no takers on my ironing board yet.”
For a brief time during the 1990s, Brandt lowered the asking price from $300 to $250, but it was still not enough to get rid of the darn thing, so instead she just calls in day after day in hopes that somebody out there might want it.
“I haven’t lost hope,” said Brandt. “One day the right listener will be listening and will think ‘hey, that’s an excellent price for Mrs. Brandt’s ironing board’ and will give me a call at 326….oh, I shouldn’t say my number on the air yet.”
Brandt admits that her main reason she calls in at this point is just to maintain her relationship with the Trading Post host.
“I feel like we’re frintschoft,” she says. “I’ve outlasted quite a few Trading Posts hosts over the decades, but I always seem to develop a close personal relationship with each one of them.”
Her children have suggested that Mrs. Brandt should consider asking a more reasonable price for the ironing board, but Brandt persists.
“I’m not going to just give it away,” she said. “Besides, if I sell this thing now, I’m not sure what I’ll do with myself between 11:30 and 11:45 every weekday morning.”",NaN,"February 28, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/oldwoman-e1512858199777.jpg?resize=628%2C353,Fake
More than a Dozen Friesens Found Frozen in Friedensruh,"FRIEDENSRUH, MB
Well, it finally happened! The Friesens of Friedensruh were found frozen just outside the family farm this Friday. According to forensics, the Friesens have been frozen since Fall, but thanks to rising temperatures this February the Friesens were finally found.
“There they were, those Friesens, completely frozen,” said Francis Funk who found them. “I know that Friesens are particularly susceptible to freezing, but I thought they would have better sense and take precautions.”
The Friesens of Friedensruh are finishing their thawing in the MB church basement, while women from the hospitality committee take turns blow-drying the family in hope they’ll be at room temperature in time for this Friday’s faspa.
“We’re feeding them formavorscht, but it’s a long process thawing a Friesen,” said Funk. “Fortunately, Mrs. Fast is here. She’s an expert in reheating Friesens.”
Friends and family are warning all Friesens to stay inside until the temperatures get well above 40 Fahrenheit as a Friesen can become froze in just fifteen minutes. Fortunately, these Friesens were the first Friesens to freeze this year.

Local Mom Sentenced to Three Years Watching ‘Peppa Pig’,"WINNIPEG, MB
As punishment for who the heck knows what, a Manitoba judge has sentenced local mom Samantha Hiebert to three years watching the world’s most annoying show Peppa Pig with her daughter Amy.
“I’m not sure what I did wrong, but it seems I’ve been condemned to watch this dreadful show,” said Hiebert from her home/cell in North Kildonan. “I’ve heard of moms being forced to watch Paw Patrol or Dora…but Peppa Pig? What have I done to deserve this?”
Amnesty International is already pressing to have her case reopened, as watching Peppa Pig is by far the harshest sentence in Canadian law.
“This is cruel and unusual punishment,” said an Amnesty representative. “No one should have to suffer through Peppa Pig no matter what crime they’ve committed!”
Hiebert has tried to convince little Amy to give Sesame Street or Mr. Dressup a try, but Amy isn’t content until those poorly animated pink pigs appear on the screen.
“I’ve still got two-and-a-half years to go in my sentence,” said Hiebert. “In the mean time, I’ve asked Dan to get a vasectomy so that I never have to suffer through Peppa Pig again!”

New Evidence Suggests Second Amendment Was All Just Satire,"WASHINGTON, DC
Historians at a prominent American university have uncovered evidence that may radically alter our perception of the supposed “right to keep and bear arms.” According to recently uncovered documents, the entire Second Amendment was meant as satire.
“I’m certain that future generations will see the Second Amendment for the brilliant joke that it is,” said an overly confident Thomas Jefferson in his recently uncovered diary. “It’s rather amusing, I must say, and so obviously satirical that I cannot fathom any scenario whereby future generations will judge it beneficial to the welfare of the nation for general members of the public to possess whatever weapons they see fit. I mean, that would be friggin’ nuts.”
Apparently, the Founding Fathers threw the Second Amendment in there to add some levity to what otherwise was an overly serious document.
“Evidently, Jefferson had been reading a lot of the great Irish satirist Jonathan Swift in those days,” said Professor Smythe. “I think it’s safe to say that the Second Amendment is the greatest piece of satire in the history of American literature.”
According to the professor, Americans often struggle to detect satire and sometimes take seriously things that are clearly meant to be a joke.
“I can’t believe no one noticed this before. Think about it. You’re just going to indiscriminately let random dudes across the country own high-powered implements of death?” said Smythe. “That’s so far from reasonable and sensible, that it should be obvious it’s satire.”
In response to the news, the NRA announced it was going to shut down its political lobby and instead dedicate itself to roaming the country performing its unique brand of sketch comedy.

Canadians Heartbroken After American Crokinole Squad Defeats Team Canada in Shootout,"PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA
Extra time was needed to decide the Gold Medal in Women’s Crokinole at the 2018 Winter Olympics on Wednesday. After two hours where neither team was able to reach that 100 point threshold, the game was decided by seeing who could flick the most twenties.
“No one would’ve thought those knipsers from Kansas would perform so well against the Canadians, but they did,” said shocked Team Canada fan Diane Driedger of Leamington. “They knipsed and knipsed like I’ve never seen an American knips before!”
Canada was the odds-on favourite coming into the Games, but struggled to get their knipsers into the hole in the late stages of the match.
“A silver medal is just not satisfactory,” said Driedger. “When it comes to knipsbrat, it’s gold or bust for Team Canada!”
The loss soon turned to outrage as Canadians took to social media to express their disgust.
“It’s time we stop deciding gold medal matches with a knips-out,” said Twitter user @knipsfan83. “It’s really not fair to let the match be decided just on how many twenties you can get. I mean, where’s the defence? Where’s the strategy? Important games should not be decided like this!”
American knipsbrat fans said the Canadians were just being sore losers and vowed to beat them in the men’s finals on Saturday.
“That just shows how much the Americans pay attention to knipsbrat,” said Driedger. “Our men’s teams didn’t even make the semi-finals. The National Crokinole League didn’t let us send our best knipsers.”

Mennonite Hero Saves Woman Who Feschlucked Herself,"NEUHORST, SK
Although Mrs. Friesen of Neuhorst has nearly ferchlucked herself on numerous occasions in the past, a particularly side-splitting joke at a wedding reception this weekend almost meant her demise. Unfortunately for Mrs. Friesen she reached for a glass of water just as the joke about Peter and Anna’s wedding night reached the punch line.
“Oba, looks like Mrs. Friesen really feschlucked herself this time,” said quick thinking Mrs. Epp, who performed the Heimlich Maneuver. “There was water everywhere. On her blouse, in my face, and most certainly down the wrong tube.”
Thanks to Mrs. Epp’s adept abdominal thrusting, Mrs. Friesen was saved from her feschlucking.
“Jauma! I’ve got to be a little more careful in the future,” said Mrs. Friesen. “A woman’s really got to think long and hard before taking a sip of water when that hysterical Mr. Penner is MCing the reception. I wouldn’t want anyone else to feschlucke themselves like I did.”
Previously Mrs. Friesen nearly feschlucked herself at Timothy Plett’s baptism in 1987, Mrs. Petkau’s funeral back in 1998, and Gerry and Helen’s 50th wedding anniversary in 2002.
“I should have known something like this would happen. After all, I’d nearly done it on numerous other occasions,” said Mrs. Friesen. “All I know is if I ever feschlucke myself again, I’ll make sure to have Mrs. Epp nearby.”

Patrik Laine Has Now Officially Passed Jonathan Toews in Total Mennoniteness,"WINNIPEG, MB
Despite his Finnish origin and inability to speak Plautdietsch, Winnipeg Jets star Patrik Laine is now officially even more Menno than Jonathan Toews. According to sources, his moustacheless beard was inspired by the desire to out-Menno the most Menno hockey player of them all, Chicago Blackhawks superstar Jonathan Toews.
“Hey, if going Menno will get me a few Stanley Cups and a Conn Smythe Trophy or two, then I’m more than willing to carefully shave my upper lip while letting the rest of it grow,” said Laine. “Who knows, I might even be able to attract one of those Penner girls from Winkler.”
Once his beard reached the appropriate length earlier this month, elders at the North Kildonan Mennonite Church declared Laine the “Most Mennonite player in the NHL,” and awarded him an engraved silver chalice filled with delicious white creamy gravy, which Laine quickly devoured.
“In the off season, I’m even thinking of getting dunked at the MB church,” said Laine. “I’ll do anything to improve my game.”
In addition to emulating Jonathan Toews in every way he can think of, Laine has also been inspired by famed Mennonite writer Miriam Toews, and is considering penning a fictionalized account of his growing up years in Tampere.
“If you’re a Toews (or Reimer or even an Unger for that matter) I’m going to be watching your every move,” said Laine. “I try to get out to Steinbach whenever I can to see those Toews’ in action.”

New Canada Food Guide Makes Farmer Sausage its Own Food Group,"OTTAWA, ON
In an effort to reshape the unhealthy eating patterns of Canadians, the new Canada Food Guide has made formavorscht it’s own food group and now recommends 6-10 servings per day.
“A lot of Canadians aren’t getting enough fat and protein. Some of them were relying far too heavily on chicken or beef,” said Health Minister Diane Owen. “It’s time we consume more alternative sources of protein such as Mennonite farmer sausage.”
The guide recommends 1 kilo a day for children, but adults could easily stand to eat an entire ring….or two.
“Our studies have shown that outside of southern Manitoba, the average Canadian was just not getting enough farmer sausage,” said Owen. “If we want to have a healthier society, we really need to ramp it up. We also recommend a dramatic increase in schmaunt fat and vereneki eating to round out a well-balanced diet.”
According to the new Canada Food Guide, the new food groups are Grains, Vegetables, Dairy, and Farmer Sausage.
“If there was one thing I wish I could convince the population of, it’s that they need to be eating fewer vegetables and more sausage!” proclaimed Owen. “Just think of all those carrots and green peppers you’re putting into your body year after year. It takes its toll. I know I can’t change everything over night, but if we could get people to eat just a bit more formavorscht I think we’d see a dramatic increase in overall health of the nation.”
Owen also recommended a dramatic increase in the consumption of Mennonite desserts.
“Remember what they always say,” said Owen. “A platz a day, keeps the doctor away.”

“Anytime an AFKR wins a gold medal, we’ll be playing ‘Raspberry Beret’ rather than the Russian anthem,” explained Olympic President Thomas Bach. “Either that or ‘When Doves Cry.’ They’ll have their choice.”
Russian athletes were initially reluctant to adopt the new moniker, but after seeing their fancy sequined outfits and high heels they immediately changed their tune.

Dishes are Miraculously Washed as Mennonite Man Naps on Sunday Afternoon,"SCHANZENBURG, SK
After devouring a delicious meal of schinke fleish and fried potatoes, local man Henry Wiebe, 47, decided to unbutton his pants, kick up his feet, and lie down in the living room while the Wiebe women did the dishes and cleared the table.
“Sunday is a day of rest,” said Wiebe. “I wouldn’t want to have to put my eternal salvation at risk by helping Martha and Annie with the dishes.”
Wiebe has made a habit of sitting on his ass and not helping out ever since he was a little boy. It’s a proud Mennonite tradition he plans to pass on to his children.
“I’m not sure how it happens, but somehow the table is cleared and dishes are clean,” said Wiebe. “It’s amazing. The table is all messy, I go lay down for a nice meddachschlop, and when I wake up, the dining room is spotless. It’s a miracle!”
The Miracle of the Washed Dishes is being attributed to the pious and devout faith of our Mennonite men.
“The only explanation I have for this miracle is that God must be blessing us men for our righteousness,” said Wiebe. “I don’t want to brag or anything, but I am a pretty darn righteous fellow.”
The holy faith of Mennonite men has also been claimed as the cause of the miraculous Taking Out of the Garbage, Vacuuming of the Living Room, and Midnight Roll in the Hay.

A List of Famous Dicks Who Are Not Mennonite,"You know those people who sit all the way to the end of the credits at a movie? What on earth are they doing? We know there’s no bonus scene at the end of Lady Bird, so what are they sticking around for? As it turns out, there’s a very simple explanation. They’re playing the Mennonite movie credit game. MaryLou Driedger blogged about this in detail. Basically the game involves sitting through the credits and looking for Friesens and Goertzens. In most cases, if you’re persistent enough, you’ll find one on nearly every movie.
Sometimes, however, we assume someone’s a Mennonite when they’re not. Our surnames were not invented by us, after all. If you’re Russian Mennonite, many of the surnames have their origin in the Netherlands, Belgium, or Prussia. If you’re Swiss Mennonite, your surnames are probably from…I would assume…Switzerland?
So, how about the Dicks? It’s one of the most celebrated Russian Mennonite surnames. Perhaps the most famous Mennonite Dick was Paul Revere Dick from 1960s rock band Paul Revere and the Raiders. However, as much as we’d like to take credit for all the Dicks in the world, many of them are not actually Mennonite. Here are a few non-Mennonite Dicks.

Children Support Literacy By Reading to Hockey Players,"BRANDON, MB
February is ‘I Love to Read’ month and that means children across the province will be taking time out of their busy schedules to promote literacy in the hockey playing population. One local elementary school sent more than a dozen children to the Keystone Centre to read to the Brandon Wheat Kings.
“These kids are great role models for the players,” said teacher Mrs. Friesen. “The players look up to these kids, so when they see little Alice or Dylan reading a book it inspires them to pick up a book once in a while themselves.”
The program has seen great success over the years, improving literacy rates among hockey players by over 50%.
“These days, we even have a few players skimming through the Hockey News on the bus toward Moose Jaw. It’s baby steps, you know…” said Friesen. “However, we haven’t been able to do anything to improve the interview skills of the players. It’s still a lot of ‘we need to work harder, get pucks to the net, stay out of the penalty box.'”
After reading a few Captain Underpants chapters, the kids from Brandon Elementary stuck around to sign autographs for the players.
“It’s really amazing how much time these kids are willing to put in,” said Friesen. “It’s tremendously rewarding. I know it’s hard to believe, but sometimes I think kids are learning just as much from the players as the players are from the children.”

Hidden Farmer Sausage Discovered in Obama’s Portrait,"WASHINGTON, DC
“It’s clearly a secret message for the Russian Mennonite community,” said Elder Janzen of Omaha. “He had formavorscht on the brain.”
Janzen is referring to the recent portrait of former President Barack Obama, which was revealed to the public on Wednesday. Mennonite art critics were quick to point out the obvious farmer sausage hidden in the arm chair.
“I always knew he was a secret Mennonite. Now no one can deny it,” said Janzen, who also suggested the lush and verdant background may be suggestive of the Mennonite orchards of Molotschna.
Others, however, have not been quite so eager to embrace the rather graphic imagery.
“It’s disgusting,” said Lutheran minister Alexander Schmidt, 83. “Just throwing a sausage in there for everyone to see. There are children watching! I must say, I’m very disappointed with his vile painting.”
Janzen later invited Schmidt to try some Mennonite farmer sausage and after consuming just one bite, the aged Lutheran immediately changed his tune.
“Dang it all, if I had known formavorscht tasted this good, I never would have signed that petition to have it removed from the presidential portrait,” said Schmidt. “Oh, well, it’s all schmaunt fat under the bridge now.”

Lonely White Male Spends Romantic Evening Alone Watching Ben Shapiro Videos,"CALGARY, AB
Jeffrey Froese, 31, manager at a local Office Depot, plans to spend an intimate evening alone tonight watching videos by controversial right-wing political pundit Ben Shapiro. This is basically what Froese does every evening, but for Valentine’s Day he plans to make it special.
“I’m going to open up a box of dark chocolate, crack open some wine, and settle in for a romantic evening with my Ben,” said Froese. “He talks so fast and uses such big words….he’s just soooooo dreamy.”
Froese is especially enamoured with Shapiro’s takedowns of left-wing snowflakes on college campuses.
“I can’t get enough of those videos,” said Froese. “Tonight, when I get home from work, I plan to drown my sorrows in Baby Duck and videos where Ben Shapiro ‘owns’ or ‘triggers’ someone. It’s gonna be great.”
Ben Shapiro, on the other hand, plans to take a break tonight from making videos for lonely white males and, instead, intends to spend a romantic evening with his wife.
“I’ve gotta say, if you’re watching Ben Shapiro vs. Snowflake videos tonight, you need to get your priorities straight,” said Shapiro. “I mean, I am Ben Shapiro, and even I think that’s a little sad.”
Upon hearing Shapiro’s cutting words, Froese was immediately triggered and vowed to watch nothing but Cenk Uygur videos from now on.

Canadian Olympians Forced to Pay Back Half Their Medals in Taxes,"PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA
Always on the lookout for new sources of revenue, the Canadian government has announced it will be taxing Olympic medals at the top income tax bracket of 48.7 percent. The medals will be melted down into gold, silver, and bronze to help recoup the tremendous cost of sending athletes to Korea.
“It’s time these athletes paid their fair share,” said a government spokesperson. “All medals will be seized when the athletes arrive back in Canada and cut in half with a band saw on the floor of the Senate.”
Senators were particularly enthusiastic about the new plan and have already signed up to take their turn cutting up and melting down Olympic medals. They plan to hold a massive medal melting ceremony, complete with multi-grain crackers and Camembert cheese.
“Team Canada won 25 medals at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, but we’re expecting even more this year,” said one Senator from Ontario. “We’ve got to find some way to pay for our new gold plated toilets.”
Olympic athletes, however, were quick to criticize the new tax.
“I get why they’re doing this, but I just wish they’d consider reducing the tax a little bit,” said one figure skater. “If they brought it down to 20 or 30 percent that would be nice. They could maybe shave off the sides of the medal a little, as long as I could still read my name.”
Later in the day, the government clarified their intentions behind the bill and announced only silver and gold medals would be destroyed, because, apparently, “no one uses the bronze medals these days anyway.” All future bronze medals will be “rounded up” to silver at the cash register.

An Exclusive Interview with the Notorious ‘Alberta Clipper’,"TABER, AB
After years of secrecy, the infamous ‘Alberta Clipper’ has agreed to this exclusive interview with the Daily Bonnet. We met Mr. Friesen in his home in Taber to ask him about why he insists on clipping his fingernails in public and causing so much bad weather across the continent.

Mennonite Church Accidentally Hires Seminary Graduate,"ALTONA, MB
“It seems we’ve been duped,” said Altona MEMBCM board chair John B. Friesen. “We never would have hired Pastor Jim had we known he was actually a highly-trained and educated individual.”
Friesen is referring to recent allegations that Pastor Jim may have received a Master of Divinity degree from a well-regarded Canadian seminary.
“He seems to have left that detail off his resume,” said Friesen. “We’re consulting our legal team to see if there’s some way we can terminate him for deceptive practices.”
Friesen says his church has had a long-standing tradition of hiring pastors who know little to nothing about the Bible.
“At most we’ll allow a Bible School diploma – and even that is pretty iffy – but once they get into Seminary, well, that’s just too much education for a Mennonite pastor,” explained Friesen. “Seminary seems to give these pastors the idea that they know more about Scripture than us church elders with a grade eight education.”
Friesen said in the entire history of the MEMBCM church they’ve never once hired a pastor who had any knowledge of Greek, Hebrew, Biblical criticism, exegesis, the history of the church, hermeneutics, theology, or anything else that might give them an advantage over the elder board.
“As far as I’m concerned, Pastor Jim has got to go!” said Friesen. “He’s far too qualified to be our pastor!”

Elon Musk Launches Buggy Full of Mennonite Elders Into Space,"CAPE CANAVERAL, FL
Pioneering SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk launched a Mennonite buggy, complete with five grumpy members of the local church elder board, into outer space on Friday. The historic launch is the first of many, with the eventual goal of establishing a peaceful Mennonite community on Mars.
“If you check our website, we’ve got a livestream of the elders orbiting the earth as we speak,” said Musk. “By next week Tuesday they will have travelled well over 4 million miles, which is officially the third longest journey in Mennonite history after the Great Trek and Claas Epp Jr.’s misguided sojourn into Central Asia.”
The elders were nominated by their home churches for the project, and each one was supplied with freeze dried packets of schmaunt fat and plumi moos to keep them nourished on their trip. Each elder was also given a Gideon’s Bible and a picture of their wife.
“They’re well taken care of up there, let me tell you,” said Musk. “If they ever come back, I guarantee they’ll be changed men.”
The elders are unable to communicate directly with us back home, though Elder Friesen appeared to give the “okay” sign with his hands earlier this morning.
“They’re having a blast,” said Musk. “I think most of them appreciate the fact they’ve got no chores to do anymore…and they’re millions of miles away from any sin.”

General Conference and Mennonite Brethren Form Joint Olympic Team,"PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA
For the first time since the great schism of 1860, the General Conference and Mennonite Brethren will compete together in the Olympics under a unified flag. The United Mennonite Team is seen as a bold step toward eventually uniting the two conferences in the future.
“Our leaders may have their differences, but when it comes to the people, deep down we’re all Mennonites,” said GC speed-skater Henrietta Berg. “I have no problem skating a relay with a MBer…if any of them were good enough to make the team, that is.”
There was some worry that the MB athletes may defect to the GC team, but so far the relationship has been all about sports and not about politics.
“We even sang a hymn together. We sang 606, and they sang the Doxology. It worked out pretty well,” said Berg. “I had never been this close to a MBer before. They’re actually pretty nice people. Not at all like the media portrays them.”
Lutherans, traditional allies with the General Conference, have expressed their opposition to the unified team, stressing that the GCers need to stand their ground and hold the MBs accountable for their excessive water usage during baptism.
“Now is not the time for unification. If anything, we should have more sanctions against the MBs until they start singing ‘Praise God from Whom All Blessings Flow’ with the proper melody,” said GC ally Herman Schmidt. “It’s time to take a stand.”

"‘Mennonites’ Deemed Offensive, To Be Replaced with ‘Personnonites’","EDMONTON, AB
Protestors surrounded a Mennonite church in Edmonton this week demanding that it immediately remove the offensive gender-specific label of ‘Mennonite’ from all signage.
“We say ‘Personnonites’ now,” said one protestor as he defaced the church sign. “After all, formavorcht and pacifism know no gender.”
While all agreed that a name change was necessary, there was some debate among the protestors as to whether to force Mennonites to change their name to Peoplenites or Personnonites or Humannonites.
“We’re also demanding that Menno Simons be referred to as People Simons from now on,” said the protestor. “We’re not too keen on the Province of Manitoba either.”
The protest went on for quite some time before the pastor came out and tried to calm the angry mob by offering them freshly baked schnetke and strawberry jam.
“If this schnetke doesn’t convince them, I don’t know what will,” said Pastor Dan. “Rhubarb platz?”
After consuming Mennonite baking for the good part of an hour, one protestor seemed to come around.

Bump of Packed Down Snow at the End of Mr. Penner’s Driveway Declared Manitoba’s Highest Peak,"WINKLER, MB
A one foot tall mound of packed down snow on Mr. Penner’s driveway has been officially declared the tallest mountain in Manitoba.
“Move over Baldy Mountain, my driveway is king now!” said a proud Mr. Penner, whose refusal to ever shovel his driveway led to the massive accumulation. “It’s only mid-February and I’ve already got the record! And every day Mount Penner continues to grow!”
Neighbourhood children look forward to Mr. Penner’s driveway bump each winter, as it’s become a popular tobogganing spot.
“It’s a bit dangerous to have the little kids sledding on that bump at the end of your driveway, but it’s the best hill Winkler’s got,” said Penner. “So far there have been no incidents.”
Mr. Penner said his mountain would be even taller if it hadn’t been for an unfortunate episode in early December.
“Mrs. Penner was so mad at me for refusing to shovel that she hired some cousins to come over and chip away at the bump,” said Penner. “Luckily I caught them before they did too much damage.”

Falling on Your Ass Only Known Way to Stop While Skating,"TORONTO, ON
After centuries of skating, Canadians have mastered the art of maneuvering their bodies at high speeds on sheets of ice, but scientists are baffled by the fact that not a single one of them has learned how to stop.
“Arenas, ponds, and skating rinks across the country are filled with enthusiastic ice skaters at this very moment,” said Dr. Dietrich Van Vogt of the University of Toronto. “Yes, indeed, thousands of Canadians are falling on their asses as we speak!”
While some have attempted to stop by grabbing onto the boards or slowly moving into the fetal position, none of these  methods have been as successful as falling on your ass.
“Once you’re flying down the ice at top speed there’s really no way to stop. I mean, it’s not like you’ve got brakes on those things,” said Van Vogt. “Slamming into the person next to you, or awkwardly grabbing hold of a better skater can work to slow you down but ultimately the only way to stop is to fall on your ass.”
Van Vogt also noted a few instances of falling face first into a snowbank or careening into the zamboni, but those he dismissed as outliers.
“Falling down is a tried and true technique,” said Van Vogt. “It’s in our blood, past on from one generation to the next and there’s no possible way this will ever change!”
Experts also suggest that Canadians will never learn to drive properly in winter.",NaN,"February 7, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/skating-e1515732905786.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
8% Tithe Now Acceptable Due to Economic Downturn,"MOUNTAIN LAKE, MN
After a slumping economy and soaring unemployment rate, the Society for the Proliferation of Mennonite Churches has determined that “an 8% tithe will be acceptable for the foreseeable future.” The change was made after yesterday’s 1200 point plunge in the Dow Jones average, which the Society felt was a harbinger of bad things to come in the church giving sector.
“Normally we’re expecting people to give 10% or more,” said Society spokesperson Wilma Froese, “but with the economy the way it is, we figured we’d let people off the hook a little. As they always say, 8% is better than nothing.”
Froese acknowledges the tough times that many people are going through, but expects full compliance with the new tithe rate.
“We don’t want to have to switch from cold cuts to Spam during faspa, so we need the giving to continue. Let me tell you, unless you want to jeopardize your standing in the community and your eternal salvation, you best be mindful of the tithe,” said Froese. “Don’t forget to give 8% of your income tax refund as well.”
Given the current economic climate, Mennonites are also being permitted to lower their tips in restaurants from the usual 2% to 1.

Tom Brady Blames Loss on Regulation Size Footballs,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN
New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady struggled to explain his team’s loss in Super Bowl LII last night, though after pressure from reporters, confessed he felt he was hampered by having to use regulation size footballs.
“I mean that’s the only thing I can think of,” said Brady. “The inability to cheat this time really hurt our chances.”
The Philadelphia Eagles, on the other hand, worked hard to ensure the game would be on the up and up and the footballs would be properly filled. Team members spent all last summer working as sausage stuffers in Lancaster county.
“There was no way we were going to let Brady slip one by us this year,” said Eagles QB Nick Foles. “Thanks to the friendly Mennonites, I can spot an under-stuffed sausage or football a mile away.”
With the football at regulation inflation level, the Eagles managed to defeat Brady and the Patriots at the first Minneapolis Super Bowl since 1992. While the Eagles are celebrating, however, rescue teams have been working around the clock to extract thousands of out-of-towners who were ill-prepared for Minnesota’s frigid winters and froze into solid blocks of ice the moment they left US Bank Stadium.
“When you’ve got 70,000 people showing up to a game in February, you’re bound to have a few casualties,” said rescue coordinator Carissa Hertz. “We’ve got a priest around for last rites just in case, but so far we’ve only had to use that on a fan from Florida who sauntered out of the stadium wearing cut-off jean shorts and a tank top.”
The priest also spent three hours comforting a distraught and weeping Tom Brady.

5 Things Mennonites Can Watch Instead of the Super Bowl,"The Daily Bonnet has teamed up with our friends over at Mennotoba to create this list of viewing alternatives to the Super Bowl. So while all your frintschoft are in the living room pretending to watch American football when really all they’re interested in is Justin Timberlake’s performance, you can sneak off with a light beer into the master bedroom, fire up your laptop, and enjoy one of these programs instead.
(One criteria for this list was that the program had be viewable streaming online or on television. So as much as our Mennotoba friends are obsessed with And When They Shall Ask, it was left off the list because you can’t, as far we know, watch it online).
So here we go, in no particular order:
5) Chuckle along with Matt Falk in Orlando Braun’s That Mennonite Joke. It’s only twenty minutes long, so you’ll have to re-watch it a few times to fill the time occupied by the Super Bowl in the room next door. But that’s okay, you’ll want to.

 
4) It’s not Ken Burns, but PBS did make a documentary about the Mennonites of Manitoba back in the 1990s. It’s informative for both those who reside in and outside the Mennonite Holy Land.

 
3) For something a little darker, you can watch this Fifth Estate episode on the notorious Mennonite Mafia. You may want to sing some hymns to cleanse yourself afterwards.

2) The Last Objectors (2016) is an excellent documentary by Andrew Wall, featuring fascinating interviews with some of the few World War II Conscientious Objectors that are still with us. A must watch! (The link only works in Canada I believe).
Watch the Last Objectors online here
If you’re unable to watch it online, you can purchase the Last Objectors DVD here.
1) What good Canadian Mennonite would watch the Super Bowl when you could watch the Canadian Women’s Curling Finals instead? On top of that, this year both finalist teams in the Scotties, Jennifer Jones and Kerri Einarson, are from Manitoba. What more could you ask for? (For any Americans reading this, curling is a winter sport involving large rocks slid down sheets of ice. It also involves sweeping and beer).

‘O Canada’ to Be Replaced with Crash Test Dummies Lyrics,"OTTAWA, ON
After a week long public consultation process that included chatting with random dudes on the Internet, Ottawa has decided to update the national anthem for the 21st century by using lyrics from a briefly popular Canadian band from the early 1990s.
“We’ve searched far and wide and come up with the best possible anthem we could, considering we were given fifteen minutes and a dial-up Internet connection to do it,” said bill sponsor and Toronto MP Richard Huxley. “We’re going to switch out significant portions of the song with Crash Test Dummies lyrics.”
In the new version, the line ‘God keep our land’ will be replaced with the Crash Test Dummies line, ‘God shuffled his feet.’
“Personally I think it’s quite poignant,” said Huxley. “We’re also replacing the first two lines of the anthem with ‘Mmm mmm mmm mmm.'”
The new national anthem will be ready for schools and hockey games this week, just in time for the Winter Olympics.
“I’m not sure we’re going to win many medals this year with the NHL players refusing to play,” said Huxley, “but if we do manage to get a medal you can bet there will be a tear in every eye when we join together as a country to sing ‘Superman never made any money, saving the world from Solomon Grundy.'”
In keeping with the Crash Test Dummies theme, Canadians will also be required to sing two octaves lower than they normally do.

Buns Discovered in Mennonite Grandma’s Freezer Carbon Date to 5 Million Years Old,"TABER, AB
A bag full of frozen raisin buns discovered at the back of Grandma Wiebe’s freezer this past week were taken to a University of Alberta laboratory to undergo rigorous scientific testing including carbon dating. The results show the buns date back to the Pliocene Epoch and are between 3 to 5 million years old.
“So far these are the oldest buns we have on record,” said Dr. Patricia Quiring. “They’ve been in the back of Mrs. Wiebe’s freezer for millions of years. I’m really surprised they hadn’t been discovered until now. I guess no one ever looked past the Pizza Pops.”
Scientists also discovered a plastic pail of frozen green bean soup dating to the Cretaceous period and a half-eaten tray of platz from the Jurassic era.
“All these items are in remarkable shape considering their age,” said Dr. Quiring. “Most of the specimens are museum quality and are still pretty darn tasty after a few minutes in the microwave.”
To further her research into Mennonite food preservation practices, Dr. Quiring is assembling a team of undergraduates to excavate Mrs. Wiebe’s root cellar later in the week.
“We’re gonna carbon date her raspberry preserves and pickled beets and whatever else she’s got in those jars down there,” said Quiring. “I hear she’s accumulated quite the collection of slowly rotting treats.”
Dr. Quiring has also received permission from the family to carbon date Grandpa Wiebe while he sleeps.

Peace Talks in Winkler-Morden Move Toward ‘Two-State Solution’,"OCCUPIED MORDEN TERRITORY, MB
After decades of tension between the neighbouring Pembina Valley communities, representatives from Morden and Winkler have sat down at the negotiating table in Walhalla, North Dakota with hopes of bringing lasting peace to the area.
“Things became very heated between Winkler and Morden in the last several months, especially after the federal government listed Morden as a ‘suburb’ of Winkler in the last census,” said Pembina Valley political expert George Friesen. “Thankfully, both sides are now ready to talk.”
Winklerites have accused Mordeners of corrupting their children with corn, apples, and beer, while Mordeners accuse Winklerites of being a little uptight. The hope is that the Walhalla talks with bring about positive relationship between the two neighbours.
“For years, Winklerites have been taking over Morden, telling us ‘don’t do this and don’t do that’ or ‘the Bible says such and such,’ but it’s time we truly gained our independence,” said Morden’s top negotiator Mr. Cornapple. “Let’s just remember, Morden was here long before the Mennonites ever arrived!”
Many in Winkler, however, believe the Pembina Valley is their promised land and are not willing to concede.
“First we were in Belgium and Holland, then Prussia, then Ukraine, then when we first came over we were in the East Reserve for a while,” said Mr. Klassen of Winkler, “but oba, the land was swampy and no good for farming so we came over here to the West Reserve. This truly is our Promised Land!”
Mr. Klassen is thinking of starting a kibbutz near Morden, but the Hutterites have claimed a monopoly on any communal living in the area.

Mennonite Woman Confesses to Photoshopping Church Directory Photos,"GOESSEL, KS
Mrs. Penner, 83, of Goessel has been responsible for compiling the EMB church directory for more than thirty years and, so far, everyone had been quite satisfied with her work. A little too satisfied it seems, as Mrs. Penner has recently confessed to photoshopping the pictures to make them more flattering ever since the technology was available to do so.
“At first I just took out the red eye or removed that embarrassing zwieback crumb on Mr. Friesen’s slacks, but gradually my editing skills improved and I got a little more….involved,” explained Penner. “Little Timmy isn’t smiling? I’ll give him a smile. Uncle Jakob didn’t show up to the baptism? I’ll splice him in there. Mrs. Buhler wants a bit more thigh gap? No problem!”
Mrs. Penner’s speciality has been in adding bonnets and removing wrinkles, but she also says the pastor has asked to “remove visible cleavage” on numerous occasions.
“The church directory is our public face, so it’s best to err on the side of modesty,” said Mrs. Penner. “We can’t be giving out the wrong impression. The last thing we would want is for people to think we were General Conferencers.”
Some parishioners were shocked to discover their photos had been altered without their knowledge or consent.
“I don’t think anyone should complain. We take all the photos in the church library. When you agree to get your photo taken, you’re agreeing to having your likeness used in any way the Goessel EMB sees fit,” said Mrs. Penner. “So if your smiling face shows up on a billboard out on Bison Road you should not be surprised. Take it as a compliment.”
The church directory is updated once a year, with an annual “Excommunicated” section that continues to grow.

Mennonite Town Bans Using Turn Signals,"NEUSCHANZENBACH, MB
In an effort to stave off encroaching worldliness, the small Mennonite town of Neuschanzenbach has banned the use of turn signals, driving with the headlights on, and shoulder-checking before changing lanes. The new law is in response to increasing numbers of Englishers driving safely and signalling their intentions in the village.
“We can’t have these outsiders coming in here and flashing their fancy turn signals all over town,” said Neuschanzenbach reeve Bernie Neufeld. “For years we’ve gotten on just fine without ever using a turn signal and I don’t see why we need to change that now.”
Village residents belong to a peculiar Mennonite sect who are perfectly fine with modern motorized transportation, but find any safety requirements like signalling before a lane change or coming to a full and complete stop to be utterly sinful.
“If you ask me, turn signals shows a complete lack of faith,” said Neufeld. “It’s the same reason I don’t scrape the ice off my windshield.”
Over the last thirty years, Neufeld has not used his turn signal once and is considered a role model for young people and a prominent and highly respected leader of the local anti-turn signal movement.
“My hope and prayer is that our Mennonite young people don’t succumb to the turn signalling ways of the world like they’ve done with drinking and dancing,” said Neufeld, feeling rather pious about the whole thing. “I sure hope this Mennonite tradition doesn’t die out with my generation.”
While Neuschanzenbach has much lower than normal compliance with turn signal laws, it also has the nation’s highest numbers of people swearing loudly in Low German and flipping off other drivers.

"Police Raid Mennonite Gambling Den, Seize Hundreds of Rook Cards","WICHITA, KS
Wichita police stormed a notorious local gambling den this week, arresting more than two dozen Mennonites and seizing countless decks of Rook cards. The raid is the largest bust of Mennonite gamblers since the famous Skip-Bo raid of ’94.
“I’ve never seen so many Rook cards. There were five games going on at once!” said Constable Jansen. “I estimate the street value might be close to twenty or thirty dollars if you add it all up. I’m sure glad we’ve been able to seize these Rook cards and keep them out of the hands of innocent Mennonite children.”
The game of Rook has been popular among Mennonites ever since it was introduced by Elder Schmidt at a church New Year’s Eve party in the 1960s. At the time, the Red, Yellow, Green, and Black suits were seen as a holier alternative to the pictorial suits found in traditional playing cards.
“Unfortunately, you can play all the same games. We caught these Mennonites playing Texas Hold-em with Rook cards. They were calling it Pennsylvania Hold-em, but it seemed about the same to me,” said Jansen. “When we busted in, Elder Penner was just gathering up his winnings. He had won more zwieback than a man could eat in his entire life!”
Close to thirty Mennonites have been charged with misusing Rook cards and could face up to three weeks of potluck dishwashing duty if convicted.
“Let me tell you, I’ve learned my lesson. I’m never gambling with Rook cards again,” said Mrs. Warkentin. “I’ll just stick to wagering on how long the sermon will go on Sunday. I always bet at least an hour-and-a-half. So far I’ve never lost.”
The Wichita police later held a huge bonfire in front of city hall to burn all the Rook cards while hundreds of Mennonites looked on in disbelief and quietly wept.",NaN,"January 29, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/raid-e1516858919401.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Rare Plautdietsch Dictionary Nets $2.3 Million at Sotheby’s Auction,"NEW YORK, NY
Bidding was frenzied at a recent antiquarian book auction in New York City this week. Of particular interest to collectors was a rare out-of-print copy of Dr. Jack Thiessen’s ‘Mennonite Low German Dictionary.’
“Bidding started at 35 cents and skyrocketed from there,” said Sotheby’s auctioneer Alana Whitcomb. “There are so few Plautdietsch dictionaries out there that Mennonites are willing to sell the farm to get one…literally.”
Dr. Thiessen’s dictionary broke an auction record previously held by a signed first edition of Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales.
“Without a good Plautdietsch dictionary like Dr. Thiessen’s, Mennonites are just making up words and spellings as they go,” explained Whitcomb. “There are sixteen known variations of the word schmauntfat alone. It’s difficult for Plautdietsch writers out there. Without a good dictionary, they’re completely lost. That’s what started the bidding war.”
The winning bidder was Mrs. Helen Toews of Winkler, a church secretary and amateur poet, who sold her family’s dairy quota to pay for the book.
“Finally I’ll be able to spell Plautdietsch words with confidence!” said Mrs. Toews. “The church bulletins will never be the same!”
The rare Thiessen dictionary was purchased last year in Steinbach at the local thrift store. Now that he’s a millionaire, the generous seller, who wishes to remain anonymous, plans to donate the two dollars he originally spent on the book back to the MCC.

Millennial Puts on Her Nicest Ripped Jeans for Church this Sunday,"ROSTHERN, SK
A 20-something at South Rosthern MB church decided to dress up in her finest attire this Sunday, which consisted of tight ripped blue jeans and an Old Navy sweatshirt, the most formal clothes she had in her entire wardrobe.
“I figured I’d go all out with the rips this Sunday,” said 22-year-old Amy Penner, who purchased her ripped jeans for $300 at a boutique shop in downtown Saskatoon. “These are definitely my Sunday best.”
Penner says she normally wears just an everyday $100 pair of ripped jeans to church most weeks, but figured she’d wear an extra rippy pair this Sunday to honour the Lord.
“I guarantee you these jeans cost a lot more money than Mrs. Friesen’s Reitmans dress,” explained Penner. “I splurged and got the 8-rip pair rather than the cheaper 6-rip pair.”
Meanwhile, Mrs. Friesen has been making a killing buying old jeans from the MCC Store, putting rips in them and selling them to young suckers.
“It’s nice to see some of the young people wearing my thrift store jeans,” said Mrs. Friesen. “I’ve raised so much money selling these things, I could supply the church ladies with pickles for years to come!”
Moms at South Rosthern are hoping the ripped jeans thing becomes a trend so they don’t have to spend so much time sewing patches.

Mennonite Woman’s Salads Consist Mostly of Whipped Cream,"LEAMINGTON, ON
First-time attendees at a recent church potluck were shocked to discover just what passes for salad in Mennonite country. The Bennett family of Toronto ventured out of the big city to visit relatives in Leamington and were baffled by the wide range of “salads” all of which seemed to contain copious amounts of Cool Whip.
“I always thought salad implied some sort of green vegetable, you know like lettuce or cucumber or something,” said Mrs. Bennett. “But these Mennonites have a whole wide world of salad that I wasn’t even aware existed.”
The outsiders were dazzled by the variety of whipped cream-based salads at the potluck, which included whipped cream and oranges, whipped cream and pistachios, and whipped cream and cherries.
“That last one also contained a lot of Jell-O,” said Mrs. Bennett. “There wasn’t a vegetable to be seen for miles around. It’s like these Mennonites consume nothing but huge chunks of red meat and highly-processed dairy.”
Potluck organizer Mrs. Brandt, 85, was quick to defend the reputation of her church.
“I tried bringing a bean salad once but there were so many leftovers, Henry was eating nothing but legumes for months,” said Mrs. Brandt. “After that, I learned my lesson. It’s whipped cream or bust!”
The Bennetts of Toronto say they found Mennonite customs a little strange, but after consuming so much sugar on Sunday they’ve developed a dependance and might be back for next week’s potluck.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Brandt said Mennonite salads are nothing to be ashamed of and, “besides,” she said, “you should see what passes for ‘salad’ in Germany.”

Church Attendance “Way Up” in Calgary as Flames Threaten to Leave Town,"CALGARY, AB
As the owners of the beloved Calgary Flames threaten to move the team to Houston or Seattle, tens of thousands of Calgarians have returned to church in order to “get right with the Lord” and stave off imminent doom.
“I haven’t prayed this hard since I was a child and I really wanted that N64 for Christmas,” said local Flames fan Jeremiah Goerzen, 34 of nearby Airdrie. “I’m asking the Lord to work in Mayor Nenshi’s heart and get that arena built!”
Since the crisis began in fall, church attendance has soared, with everyone from Lutheran and Presbyterian to Baptist and Evangelical churches reporting an uptick. Even the local Mennonite churches have seen an increase.
“They come dressed in Flames jerseys and they stay for faspa,” said Reverend Koop. “It seems they’re so desperate to get on the Lord’s good side that they’re even taking notes during the sermon and tithing a full 10%.”
Even Flames mascot Harvey the Hound has stepped up his church attendance lately.
“I had backslidden for a while, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes,” said Harvey, from his pew at the Centre Street Church west campus. “If the Flames leave, I’m out of work.”
Reports out of Toronto indicate a similar increase in church attendance as Torontonians pray they’ll finally get a team of their own.

Local Chiropractor Specializes in Treating Mennonite Rubbernecking Injuries,"CHORTITZ, MB
A southern Manitoba chiropractor has decided to focus his talents on addressing neck injuries caused by prolonged gawking and staring, which, he says, is a common problem in Mennonite communities everywhere.
“Prolonged periods of rubbernecking can put a real strain on your cervical vertebrae,” said Bernie Thiessen. “I recommend that patients take a break from rubbernecking every fifteen minutes or so. Get up, stare at someone else for a few minutes, then go back to ogling those strange-looking Englishers from the city.”
Thiessen said some of his patients come to see him after spending an entire weekend sitting on lawn chairs in the front lawn with a bag of zoat, staring and commenting about every car as they pass.
“I have no idea why they don’t sit in the backyards where it’s not so distracting, but I guess they just like to people watch,” said Thiessen. “It’s nice that they’re curious, but I just wish they’d think about what this excessive rubbernecking is doing to their spinal alignment…”
Thiessen’s Rubbernecking Emporium is open six days a week, and does allow walk-ins, but he recommends that ailing Mennonites make an appointment so that they’re not tempted to sit in the waiting room and stare at all the other patients.

Mennonite Couple Divorces After Discovering Common Ancestor,"ALTONA, MB
After years of searching genealogy websites and poring through family history books, local man Peter Nikkel of Altona, has learned that he and his wife Anne are distantly related. Upon discovering the news, Peter immediately asked his wife Anne for a divorce.
“Finally! I always knew we were fifth cousins,” said Peter. “Well, I guess we’ll have to do the honourable thing and split up this fifty-three year marriage.”
Anne immediately agreed to the divorce, saying she could always sense there was something amiss with Peter.
“His love-making was always a little reserved,” said Anne. “I would expect that kind of hesitancy from a close relative. Now it all makes sense!”
Peter and Anne broke the news to their five children and twenty grandchildren at a family gathering last week.
“Well, kids, your mother and I have some sad news,” said Peter. “We found a common ancestor from back in the Prussia days and that means it’s all over between us!”
The Nikkel children will undergo rigorous scientific testing in the new few weeks to make sure they’re all “okay” despite having such closely related parents.

Ever Notice How the MCC Logo Looks Exactly Like the State of Texas?,"Something’s going on here. I’m not sure what it is. But for some reason our beloved Mennonite Central Committee has been using a logo that’s shaped exactly like the state of Texas. And this has been going on for years! It’s even more similar if you rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.
Now I know the MCC logo is a mash-up of a cross and a dove…but then that raises the question of why the state of Texas is shaped like a cross and a dove? It’s hardly the most peaceful state. And their preferred method of execution is lethal injection not crucifixion. I just don’t get it.
I suppose there are a few Mennonites in Texas. I mean, Mennonites are everywhere, but wouldn’t it have made more sense to make it shaped like Pennsylvania or Indiana or Manitoba?

Ancient Zwieback Recipe Discovered in Dead Sea Scrolls,"HAIFA, ISRAEL
Scientists at Haifa University were shocked to discover a recipe for the dry Mennonite bread known as “zwieback” in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The fragment was the last to be translated and the first to contain anything from the Mennonite Treasury Cookbook.
“It’s remarkable. For years, I thought my Grandma Schultz invented zwieback. But it seems the recipe goes back a lot farther than that,” said Timothy Schultz of Mountain Lake. “This new information reaffirms my faith in our traditional Mennonite recipes.”
Experts claim the recipe has remained unchanged for thousands of years and is identical to Mrs. Friesen’s recipe in the Mennonite Treasury.
“What can I say? The Lord preserves his Word,” said Reverend Unger. “Centuries of toil and strife have not been able to stamp out our Scriptures. The zwieback recipe we’re using now is exactly the one used centuries ago, without one single jot or tittle changed!”
The Zwieback Fragment is considered very precious and extremely fragile. As such, it will be preserved using the very best techniques known to Mennonites: putting it in a ziplock bag and tossing it in the church kitchen freezer next to the liverwurst.",NaN,"January 22, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/deadseascroll-e1516643830822.jpg?resize=622%2C350,Fake
"Singer Ed Sheeran Engaged to Every Woman Who Ever Yelled “Marry Me, Ed” at One of His Concerts","SUFFOLK, UK
According to British law, mellow pop singer Ed Sheeran is legally engaged to more than 12,000 women who have yelled, “marry me,” at his concerts over the years. Among the lucky young women is Diana Penner, 22, of Winkler, Manitoba, who is already planning a summer wedding in the MB church basement.
“If I yell ‘marry me, Ed,’ and he doesn’t interrupt his song to yell, ‘thanks, but no thanks, Diana!’ then that’s a legally binding contract,” said Penner. “Not only do I get to marry a pop star, but now Grandma Penner will get off my back about finding a husband.”
The High Court in London released a list of thousands of women who are believed to be  betrothed to the red-headed singer, which included more than a hundred at his Winnipeg concert alone.
“I know there are a few other women out there who are trying to stake their claim, but I don’t mind,” said Penner. “I think I can win him over. Once you go Mennonite, you can’t go back.”
Ed Sheeran has not yet responded to the ruling and was last seen huddling in the fetal position in a remote Yorkshire castle.
Meanwhile, Miss Penner says she intends to track him down so that they can plan their future together, which, she says, includes, “producing the pastiest palest children the world has ever seen.”

Server Left Waiting Awkwardly at the Table for Mennonite Couple to Finish Praying,"FARGO, ND
Poor Diana, a third year NDSU student and part-time server at Chili’s, was left standing at the table for half an hour holding a Mix & Match trio of steak, shrimp and chicken fajitas, while the Reimers of Winkler finished praying.
“I didn’t want to interrupt, but the food was getting cold and my arms were starting to wobble, so I cleared my throat to get their attention…but the man just kept on going,” explained Diana. “‘Bless Timmy back home, and bless Grandma, and bless the hands that have prepared it, and bless our server Diana,’ I’m a praying woman, myself, but it was too much.”
After fifteen minutes or so, her other tables were starting to wonder where she was and the manager stopped by to inquire what was up.
“This isn’t the first time I’ve seen this,” said store manager Amanda. “Whenever the Mennonites come down for a shopping spree this always happens. But we give them their space and let them just keep on praying. 20, 30, 40 minutes. Whatever it takes to get that food blessed and ready to eat.”
In an interview after the meal, Mr. Reimer said he could sense that Diana was at the table, and even got a nudge from Mrs. Reimer to speed things up and stop being rude, but explained he was eating at Chili’s and so the food needed a bit of extra prayer.
“Makes total sense to me,” said Diana. “I mean, I’ve had our fajitas, too, and let me tell you, it’s not pretty in the morning.”
Diana explained she was being extra polite in hopes of getting a really big tip.

Churches Demand All National Parks Be Turned Into Bible Camps,"OTTAWA, ON
Churches across Canada have been up in arms and are demanding that the federal government fund “all proselytizing efforts” with tax-payer’s money. An online petition sponsored by Life Site News has demanded that all Canadian national parks, from Banff and Jasper to Riding Mountain and Mount Tremblant, be turned into Bible camps that “preach the Word to the lost!”
“We absolutely believe in freedom of religion and the separation of church and state,” said Evangelical leader John Woodward. “That is why we demand that the government divert funds needed for hospitals and schools to create Bible camps across the country!”
The group plans to teach Canadian kids how to sing Larry Norman songs, paddle a canoe without tipping, and resist the urge to make out with that Loewen girl in the bushes.
“Banff Bible Camp is going to be fantastic!” said one kid from Alberta. “I can’t wait to get my sleeping bag and roast marshmallows in the lobby of the Banff Springs Hotel!”
Instead of funding the camps through private donors and requiring campers to memorize verses to prove their worth, the new Bible camps will be staffed with government workers pretending to be Christians just so they can get a summer job.
“We are returning the nation to its glory,” said Woodward, who also claims to be a libertarian. “Just remember: taxation is theft! Therefore, tax money should be spend on Bible camps. Makes perfect sense, right?”
So far only Alberta has agreed to comply with the demands.

Tide Pods Added to Grandma’s Delightful Faspa Spread,"YARROW, BC
Having heard something of this whole “Tide Pod craze” from her grandchildren, Mrs. Neufeld of Yarrow, 69, decided to spice up the faspa last Sunday by adding a delightful selection of laundry detergent pods.
“What a spread, Mom! Ham slices, cheese curds, dill pickles, and, oh, look, my favourite: Tide Pods,” said Darryl. “You’ve really outdone yourself this time!”
The Tide Pods were a huge hit with the Neufelds, who likened the experience to the castor oil and lye soap they were made to consume as children.
“I acquired a taste for detergent back in the 80s,” said Darryl, before keeling over and requiring an ambulance.
After having his stomach pumped, Darryl regaled the family with tales of his mom’s home cooking.
“I don’t care what you say,” said Darryl. “Absolutely no one cooks Tide Pods like my mom.”

"Under New Trudeau Law, All Christian Summer Camps to Be Turned into “Reeducation Camps”","OTTAWA, ON
In order to address the “unacceptable diversity of opinions on social issues” in Canada, the Trudeau government has recently passed a law requiring all Bible camps to be shut down and re-opened as government “reeducation camps.”
“We do not want the children of our nation to stray from the glorious teachings of our dear leader Justin,” said a Canadian government spokesperson. “This is why it is better to have no camps at all then to educate a future generation of Bible-believing Christians.”
The new reeducation camps, known as “Trudeau Youth,” will feature rote memorization and daily recitation of Liberal Party platform….at least the stuff they haven’t changed since the campaign.
“Trudeau Youth camps won’t feature the usual Bible sword drills, zip lines, and canoes, but, instead will focus on regurgitation of whatever the heck we feel like these little scamps should believe,” said the rep. “God forbid these children get some influence from their parents or church.”
Harkening back to his days as a drama teacher, the Prime Minister himself has contributed a 40 minute play entitled Oh, Justin, How I Love Thee; Let Me Count the Ways, which all campers will be required to rehearse and perform.
“We’re also getting rid of all the Kumbaya garbage,” said Mr. Trudeau. “From now it’s nothing but ‘The Internationale’ and a brand new song called ‘Trudeau Über Alles.'”
The new camps will be open July 1, just in time for Canada Day and legal weed.

Top Local Chefs to Stage Fancy Dinner on Frozen Blumenort Lagoon,"BLUMENORT, MB
Manitoba’s most famous chefs will be setting aside the comforts of high-end Winnipeg restaurants this winter for a three week pop-up restaurant on the frozen Blumenort lagoon. ‘COOKED: Blumenort’ will feature all the best tattooed hipster chefs from the big city strutting their stuff in Mennonite country.
“We’ve being doing this for a while in Winnipeg, Churchill, and Gimli,” said event organizer Manuel Hendriks. “Now it’s time to show those Mennonites what cooking outside in the cold really looks like!”
The menu will consist of an 8 course tasting menu, served to dinners as they sit on a frozen lagoon behind Steve’s Livestock Transport. No alcohol will be served.
“Instead we’ve got a lovely pairing of the best Blumenort tap water money can buy,” explained Hendriks. “This menu is well worth the $150 and influenza.”
Tickets for COOKED: Blumenort are already sold out, but patrons can add their names to the waiting list at the old Bergmann place and hope for a last-minute cancellation.

Pastor’s Son By Far the Worst Behaved Kid in Sunday School,"FREDRICTON, NB
Reverend Unrau was called out of the adult Prayer Class yet again this Sunday after his son Timothy socked two other boys in the nose and called little Lisa Wilson a “Poopyface.” It was the fifth Sunday in a row that the pastor’s son had to be taken out and disciplined by his father.
“It’s like my sermons are having no effect on him whatsoever,” said Rev. Unrau. “Ruth and I try, I tell you, but no matter what we do, we just can’t get through to that boy.”
The Unraus read two Bible chapters to their son every morning and night and Timothy is often expected to help set up the chairs for faspa while the other children play, but despite this godly upbringing, Timothy is the worst of the bunch.
“I don’t get it. The Campbells feed their kids junk and let them rot their brains on cartoons every Saturday morning. Meanwhile our Timothy is expected to get up at seven and do his devotions,” said the baffled father, “and somehow our kid is the bad one. I just don’t understand!”
Timothy is reportedly also starting to get into hip-hop music, which has caused considerable controversy with the church board.
“We can’t have a pastor’s son listening to that kind of filth,” explained Elder Steeves. “If our pastor can’t control his own son, how can we expect him to lead this congregation?”
In order to keep his job at the church, Reverend Unrau is desperate to fix his son and considering sending him back to Manitoba to live with Grandma.

Dozens of Mennonite Women Left Homeless After Tornado Strikes MCC Store,"KJRIESELSTORM, KS
More than thirty Mennonite women have been left without any place to go after a tornado ripped through the heart of a local MCC Thrift Store yesterday afternoon.
“They’re here all the time. They’re here trying on jeans when I open up in the morning and they’re still here looking for candle holders when I lock up at night. They basically live here,” said devastated store manager Peter Funk. “Now that this has happened, I’m not sure where these ladies will go.”
The women are looking for something else to occupy their days, but in the small town of Kjrieselstorm, Kansas, the options are fairly limited.
“I really don’t know what I’ll do,” said Mrs. Goerzen. “If I’m not buying tonnes of stuff and then donating the exact same stuff back to the MCC, my life has no meaning.”
Emergency garage sales have been set up throughout the village in order to give the women some place to buy second hand stuff during the day.
“Thank goodness I have some place to buy a few chipped teacups,” said Mrs. Goerzen. “The community has really stepped up and provided shelter for us!”
The women had briefly considered hanging out all day at the coffee shop with the men, but decided wandering the streets aimlessly was a preferable option.

Lit Match Insufficient After Dad’s Been in There,"EDMONTON, AB
The Sawatzky family of Edmonton has discovered the hard way that a single lit match is wholly insufficient to mask the mysterious odour that often emanates from the bathroom after Dad’s been in there.
“From now on we’re giving it 30 minutes wait time and a six-pack of candles,” said daughter Rebecca, 15. “I sure hope that works, because it was so powerful, I started to lose consciousness the last time.”
The Sawatzkys have suffered through Dad’s washroom encounters for nearly two decades now, but Mom says it’s time for drastic changes.
“Something had to be done. A lit match just wasn’t cutting it,” said Mom. “We need something a lot more rubust. Your typical matchbook is no match for Dad.”
Dad deflected any criticism by blaming the matches.
“What can you expect when you buy the store brand matches?” said Dad. “I’ve been telling Mary for years now: get the good matches. But she refuses. So, you know, if she faints after I’ve been in there, it’s her own fault…”
After recent changes, the Sawatzky family bathroom now looks a lot like a Catholic shrine…and, thankfully, smells a lot like one, too.",NaN,"January 17, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_4760-e1516163167865.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Dear Martha Reimer (Mennonite Advice Column),"Dear Martha Reimer,
A while ago I went to the doctor to have my bunions checked and when I took off my brown nylons and felt his warm rough manly hands on my bunions, I got a tingly sensation all over. I hadn’t felt that way since my second year at Winkler Bible Institute back in 1968. Anyway, I began to find other reasons to go back and see Dr. Friesen. A back ache. Itchy tonsils. Anything. I think I’m in love. Should I tell him at church this Sunday? Sincerely, Menno in Love.
DEAR MENNO IN LOVE,
It’s very easy to confuse the natural intimacy and trust you feel with your physician or trajchtmoaka with love. You need to make certain you really are in love with Dr. Friesen before you talk to him. Spend some time apart. Have your bunions checked by another doctor. If you still feel this way about Dr. Friesen, then slip a note into his mailbox at church. Bunions have brought many Mennonite couples together. Who knows? Maybe they’ll work their magic for you, too. Sincerely, Martha.
******************************
Dear Martha Reimer,
I’ve been having some difficulty starting my tractor lately. I hop on up there hoping to have a nice good ride in the fields and for the life of me I can’t get the dang thing started. I’ve tried everything. I even got my neighbour Jake in there helping me, but nothing works! Susan says I should call a professional, but I’m a Mennonite man and I should be able to get my tractor started myself. What should I do? Sincerely, Eager to Get Plowing.
DEAR EAGER,
I hate to tell you this, but your wife is right. Tractors are a complicated piece of equipment and if you can’t get yours started, you need to get help. How long are you going to just let your tractor sit there in the barn without using it? The longer you wait, the harder it will be to get it started. Time is of the essence. Get your John Deere technician in there as soon as possible or risk never being able to get your engine running again. Soon it will be spring and you don’t want to miss out on an entire growing season. Get on it ASAP. Sincerely, Martha.",NaN,"January 16, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/martha-e1515978522479.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake

Apple Introduces New Siri Voice with Mennonite Accent,"CUPERTINO, CA
Recent changes to Apple’s Siri and Maps mean that Mennonites across the Americas will have the chance to receive directions to the nearest Chicken Chef in a comforting Plautdietsch accent. Starting January 15, iPhone users will now have the option of selecting “Mannanite voice” from the list of options.
“We went down to Menno Colony, Paraguay and recorded 80-year-old Mrs. Aggie Toews speaking for a few hours,” explained Apple CEO Tim Cook. “Let me tell you, it’s the sexiest Siri voice we’ve ever had.”
Mrs. Toews’ voice is used for Siri and for giving driving directions, though some have noted there are a few glitches.
“Whenever I use the Maps function there’s always some old man’s voice interrupting in the background, saying, ‘Nah, Aggie, dat’s not the right way at all yat,'” explained iPhone user Colin Loewen. “It’s very confusing. I think maybe it works better with buggies and tractors.”
Despite a few minor issues, most users have found the voice familiar and soothing.
“Oba, go one mile past da old Friesen’s place over by da Blumenhof School yat,” said the new Siri. “Dan turn laft und go tree miles. Be sea careful around dose corners yat as dats a gravel road for sure. Dan you’ll be right dare by da Platt’s house.”
So far, every Mennonite who’s tried it has got to where they’re going in record time.
“It’s so nice to have a Siri that I can relate to and understand,” said Mr. Rempel. “Dat old Siri said everyting wrong yat.”
Another reason to love the new Siri is that she makes an excellent plumi moos and ends every conversation by saying “Nah, yo, dan.”",NaN,"January 15, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i0.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WP_001264-1-e1515981611429.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonite Woman’s ‘Abstinence in a Pan’ Declared Worst Dessert at Church Bake Sale,"WICHITA, KS
The Wichita Mennonite Church Bake Sale generated lower than expected revenue this week, due in part to the extreme unpopularity of Mrs. Deirdre Jansen’s ‘Abstinence in a Pan’ dessert. The dessert, a variation on inappropriately named ‘Sex in a Pan,’ contained layers of corn flakes, prunes, and Premium Plus crackers.
“For years people brought that ‘other dessert,’ which I won’t mention. It was leading people astray. Giving them impure thoughts,” explained Jansen. “I figured it was time to promote a more family-friendly message. What better way to do that than with a bland disgusting dessert that no one will find the least bit titillating.”
Jansen had been working on the recipe for ‘Abstinence in a Pan’ for quite some time, and was shocked by the low sales.
“It just proves how far we’ve fallen from the true message of the Gospel,” said Jansen. “It’s a sad state of affairs when even church folks want to buy nothing but tasty and sexually-suggestive desserts.”
Jansen made more than thirty trays of ‘Abstinence in a Pan,’ which she baked every evening for the past month.
“Every time Henry was getting a little too frisky, I just told him I was baking,” said Jansen. “I may not have sold a lot of dessert at the church bake sale, but the dessert sure lived up to its name around my household!”
Prior to her ingenious invention of ‘Abstinence in a Pan,’ Jansen had always just told Henry she was “washing her hair” or “reading the Bible.” Henry reportedly bought up all the ‘Sex in the Pan’ he could get at this year’s bake sale.

Tim Hortons Raises Starting Wage to 15 Timbits an Hour,"OAKVILLE, ON
In response to widespread criticism of recent cuts to employee benefits in some of its stores, iconic Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons has graciously decided to raise its starting wage from 12 Timbits an hour to 15. Senior employees, those with at least ten years experience, will also be given two creamers and a sachet of sugar.
“We realize it’s not easy to survive on just a dozen Timbits these days,” said company spokesperson Doug Martin. “I’m confident that a couple extra toasted coconut and chocolate glazed donut holes each hour will make life a lot more comfortable for our struggling employees.”
Tim Hortons also announced a pay raise for its longest-serving employees, though it does come with some restrictions.
“Currently the pay-scale maxes out at 30 Timbits, you know for district managers and custodians and stuff, but we’re raising that to 40,” said Martin. “On your lunch break, you can just reach in there and take any Timbit you’d like…except, of course, for the sour cream glazed. If we let people take those we’d run out by 8 am.”
Employees were furious to hear they would be prohibited from receiving their pay in sour cream glazed Timbits.
“I’ve worked long and hard for this company and this is how they repay me?” exclaimed Hope Robertson. “If I can’t have free sour cream glazed Timbits during my shift, I think I’m out of here! I’ll go work at Taco Bell, where they pay you in Chili Cheese Burritos! Yum!”
The rate of 15 Timbits an hour is thought to be the highest wage of any fast food chain in Canada.

Canadian Men’s Hockey Team is Mostly Just Random Dudes from Your Church Floor Hockey League,"BRANDON, MB
The Canadian Olympic Men’s hockey team was announced Thursday and it turns out most of the guys are just random dudes from your church floor hockey league.
“With the NHL boycotting the Olympics this year, Team Canada was desperate to field a men’s hockey team,” said head coach Willie Desjardin, “so we just pinned a sign-up sheet in the Mennonite church lobby there in Brandon and took who we could get.”
The first to sign up (and therefore team captain) was Timothy Peters, 52, who was super excited to represent Canada in Pyeongchang.
“As soon as I saw the sign-up sheet next to the decaf I knew I had to join!” said Peters. “I’ve been playing floor hockey here at West Brandon Mennonite since the 1980s and, let me tell you, I can still tromp around a church gym like nobody’s business!”
After having won Olympic gold in the last couple games with NHL stars like Sidney Crosby, John Tavares, and Shea Weber, Canada will now have to pin its hopes on farmer Peter B. Wiebe, plumber Richard Martens, and the Friesen boys from just outside Gladstone.
“Too often church floor hockey is dismissed as just something to keep the men occupied so they don’t flirt with the neighbour ladies, but we’re here to prove that we can actually play,” said Peters. “I think we’ll shock quite a few people this year.”
Practice for the Olympics starts this Friday and includes a few weeks of intensive training including, first and foremost, teaching the men how to skate.

British Columbian Freezes to Death Within Minutes of Arriving in Winnipeg,"WINNIPEG, MB
Mr. Mark Thiessen of Chilliwack froze to death after walking a hundred metres from the airport terminal to his rental car this weekend. Police found his frozen corpse, with his debit card in hand, just outside the place you go to pay for the parking.
“It’s a real tragedy,” said Constable Henderson. “If he had made it to the rental car, he would have been the first British Columbian ever to survive their arrival in Winnipeg in January.”
Because of his pioneering efforts to build bridges between the BC and Manitoba Mennonite communities, Thiessen is being honoured as a martyr in his home church in Chilliwack.
“He was a very brave man,” said friend of the family Joseph Schmidt. “Going all the way out there to Manitoba…and all he was wearing was your typical BC winter wear…you know, a raincoat and galoshes. He’s really a hero of the faith. Laying down his life to visit relatives…”
Thiessen’s body is being left in the parking lot, where it will be well preserved by the subzero temperatures that envelop Winnipeg throughout the year.
“For a BC resident, making it to your car in Winnipeg is a bit like climbing Everest, and requires similar preparation and specialized equipment,” said Henderson. “I’m hoping to set up a base camp here at the airport to provide support, oxygen, and sherpas to needy BC visitors.”

Mennonite Moms Gather for Wine O’Clock…I Mean “Bible Study”,"WINNIPEG, MB
For nearly a decade, Mennonite moms in North Kildonan have been gathering every Tuesday afternoon at Diane’s house to laugh, chat, and drink overly sweet white wines.
“It all started about ten years ago as Bible Study, but, well…that didn’t last,” explained Diane, with a lovely glass of Moscato in one hand and a Riesling in the other. “Eventually we just stopped watching the Beth Moore tapes and decided to haul out the cheese and crackers and get our drinks on!”
This past week, Brenda arrived with a jar of Nutella and three bottles of Sauvignon Blanc in her arms.
“Woohoo! Time for Bible Study, ladies!” shouted Brenda, twisting open a bottle. “I’m sure glad I was able to get a sitter this week. It’s been so long since I’ve dove into the scriptures like this!”
The women took a three week break from Bible Study over the holidays, but are really looking forward to meeting weekly, if not more, in the new year.
“We made it through five bottles…I mean chapters last week,” said Diane. “I’m hoping we’ll break that record someday. Shouldn’t be too difficult.”
In unrelated news, Mennonites across Winnipeg have been raising questions as to just what exactly goes on during those “Men’s Prayer Breakfasts.”

Mennonite CPAP Machine Provides Continuous Flow of Schmaunt Fat,"HERBERT, SK
Cardiologists in the small town of Herbert, Saskatchewan are testing out a new CPAP machine that would provide Mennonites with a continuous flow of schmaunt fat while they sleep. Local man Dale Broesky has struggled with lack of schmaunt fat during sleep and feels this machine may be just the thing he needs.
“My doctors say there are times during the night when I’m not getting any schmaunt fat at all,” said Broesky. “It’s really quite serious. I often wake up tired and schmaunt fat deprived. That’s why this machine is so important.”
At the Herbert Medical Clinic, Broesky was supplied with more than 50 gallons of schmaunt fat during an 8 hour test-run. Doctors are really excited about this new technology.
“A lot of people think you only need schmaunt fat during the waking hours, but that’s simply not true,” said Dr. Unger. “Mennonites who struggle with lack of schmaunt fat should seriously consider getting one of these CPAP machines. It takes some getting used to at first, but most patients find it quite soothing after a while.”
The machine is already being covered by the Saskatchewan provincial health care plan.
“I want to leave a legacy to all those Mennonites out there,” said outgoing Premier Brad Wall. “As a Mennonite myself, I know how vital schmaunt fat is to our very survival. I’ve already taken the machine for  a test drive and let me tell you, it was the best sleep of my life! Once you try it, everyone’s gonna want one!”
The Menno CPAP machine is available with a doctor’s prescription at fine church lobbies near you.

"Dad Spares Rod, Son Not Spoiled","GRUNTHAL, MB
In a bold experimental parenting move, local Mennonite dad Tim Fehr spoke calmly with his 8-year-old son Nathaniel and explained the situation to him, rather than hauling out the belt. To the shock of the entire Fehr family, Nathaniel did not feel spoiled at all and instead demonstrated a mature and respectful tone the rest of the day.
“What my Dad said made sense. I shouldn’t be talking back to my mother like that,” said Nathaniel. “I’d never had anyone explain it me like that before. There was always just a spanking the moment I did anything wrong. But this whole talking-through-your-problems thing really worked out well for me. I actually prefer it to spanking.”
Researchers at the Centre for Mennonite Parenting say they’ve been noticing a trend toward sparing the rod in recent years.
“For centuries we believed the cause of lippy disrespectful attitudes in our children was a lack of adequate rod usage,” explained Centre spokesperson Mrs. Wiebe. “But now I see that the rod may have actually been the cause of it.”
As a result of this startling new information, the Centre for Mennonite Parenting is shifting their focus a little and is now officially recommending that parents ‘Spoil the Child and Spare the Rod.’
“Let’s try this out for a few decades and see how well it works,” said Wiebe. “If the children still can’t keep their hands to themselves in church in the year 2048, then we can go back to the old system.”
As a result of the new law, church bathrooms have been closed to Mennonite fathers for discipline purposes and reserved exclusively for actually doing a number 1 or 2.",NaN,"January 9, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i1.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dadand-son-e1515364472178.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Breaking an Arm While Sledding a Hiebert Family Tradition,"STEINBACH, MB
For almost four decades, the Hieberts of Steinbach have made an annual trip to Abe’s Hill to toboggan and break arms together as a family. This year was little Dylan’s first trip to the notorious Steinbach sledding hill and it did not disappoint.
“Dylan got pretty lucky,” explained Mrs. Hiebert. “He broke his arm and twisted an ankle on his very first trip! It took his sister Stephanie a few visits to the hill before she finally injured herself.”
The first Hiebert to break an arm on the hill was father Dwayne, who was just a child at the time, when he broke his left arm back in 1986.
“It simply isn’t winter until someone ends up in the Bethesda Hospital,” said Dwayne. “Lately I’ve taken to build ramps and jumps to make absolutely sure someone gets hurt.”
Dwayne says plastic sleds and wooden toboggans are perfect for hurting yourself, but if you really want to guarantee success, nothing beats a GT Snowracer.
“If you start from the top and really give it some oomph you can usually get some air and hit a tree or something,” said Dwayne. “I also recommend one of those giant tractor inner tubes. You’ve got very little control on those things and are bound to get your foot caught underneath and twisted around in an awkward position. It’s great!”
After a couple hours at Abe’s Hill, the Hieberts decided to head home and enjoy a few mugs of hot chocolate, which they carefully cradled with their good hands.",NaN,"January 8, 2018",NaN,NaN,https://i2.wp.com/dailybonnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sledding-e1515382684850.jpg?resize=678%2C381,Fake
Mennonites Really Excited for Tonight’s Golden Globe Awards,"ABBOTSFORD, BC
While Hollywood gathers to dress up nice and congratulate itself, Russian Mennonites across North America are going to be celebrating their own Golden Globe Awards tonight. The Mennonite Golden Globes, held annually in the ritzy Clearbrook neighbourhood of Abbotsford, honour the best portzelky of the new year.
“I don’t care what fancy name the Englishers want to give them,” said perennial Golden Globe contender Mrs. Friesen. “They’ll always be known as Portzelky to me!”
Mrs. Friesen, who has been nominated for Best All-Around Portzelky every year for the past thirty years, is considered the Meryl Streep of Mennonite New Year’s Cookies.
“This year she’s up for Best Powdered Cookie and also Best Supporting Actress for her constant nagging of her daughter-in-law Bethany, who is just beginning to make Portzelky of her own,” said Golden Globe insider Anna Epp. “I’m really excited to see who takes home the top prize tonight!”
The Mennonite Golden Globes also include awards for Best Best Raisinless Portzelky for the pickier eaters, and many variations of sugary toppings.
“There’s an award for New Year’s Cookies that are sprinkled with a light dusting of white sugar, like the General Conferencers tend to do, and a separate award for the New Year’s Cookies that are thrown into a ziplock bag and tossed around until they’re completely coated with a thick layer of icing sugar. That’s the MB method,” said Anna Epp. “And don’t even get me started on Old Colony New Year’s Cookies. That’s almost like it’s own world out there!”

Conservative Mennonite Church Approves Drinking Bud Light ‘Since it’s Not Really Beer Anyway’,"JANSEN, NE
A strict Mennonite church in the small town of Jansen, Nebraska has broken decades of teetotaller tradition by approving the consumption of Bud Light. At a membership meeting on Saturday, the church board ruled that Bud Light did not qualify as actual beer.
“It ain’t no sin to drink water,” said Pastor David. “From now on all our church faspas will include cheese, pickles, and a round or two of Bud Light!”
The ruling came after months of extensive research from the elder board, who preferred their Bud Light with a squeeze of lemon and a few ice cubes.
“We got together every Monday night for the past few months to pray, study scripture, and drink Bud Light,” explained Pastor David. “Not only did I acquire a taste for light watery beer, but I’m also now a huge Chiefs fan!”
In all those Monday night Bible studies, the men of the elder board never once got drunk.
“Bud Light is officially approved,” said Pastor David. “As I can assure you, from frequent experience, that the contents of this bottle contain absolutely no alcohol or any flavour whatsoever!”
The church has also voted to approve cigarette smoking so long as the smokers stay out of the Ladies Quilting Room.

New Trump Book Nothing But Reprints of Daily Bonnet Articles,"WASHINGTON, DC
Young anti-Trump liberals across America were shocked and dismayed as they opened their copies of Fire and Fury, supposedly a searing new expose about the Trump White House, to find nothing but reprints of Daily Bonnet articles. Sales of the book were brisk, especially among the 18-35 year old “snowflake” demographic, who were instantly brought to tears by the unexpected content.
“When I read a book about Donald Trump I want nothing but the cold hard facts, not some bullshit made up by some unfunny Mennonite in Canada,” said blogger @hillarywasrobbed. “Plus, why should I pay for what I can read for free on the Daily Bonnet?”
Author Michael Wolff defended his extensive use of Daily Bonnet articles in the Donald Trump book.
“When I research a book, I go to the best sources possible: wikipedia; satire sites; the Hillary campaign. You name it,” said Wolff. “It’s 2018. This is the best we can do. What do you expect? Woodward and Bernstein?”
The book has been hailed as “ground-breaking” in its gratuitous use of fake satirical news and in the absolutely brilliant way it completely confirmed its reader’s biases.

Mennonite Man Converts JWs at the Front Door,"ALTONA, MB
On a frosty winter morning, after a marathon theological discussion that lasted almost five hours, Mr. Peter Siemens of Altona successfully converted the Jehovah’s Witnesses at his front door.
“I was still in my pyjamas when they rang the bell at 7:30 this morning,” said Mr. Siemens, “but I was ready for them!”
The discussion covered a wide variety of subjects including the End Times, the trinity, and whether you should refuse to join the army…or join the army and just shoot over the enemy’s head. Every time the pair of JWs were about to leave, Mr. Siemens kept them at the door, by saying, “But just one more thing…”
“We got through a lot of material at the front door,” said Siemens. “It never even occurred to me to invite them inside.”
The JWs, who are now calling themselves Mennonites, apparently agreed to convert if Siemens would let them inside for just fifteen minutes to warm up.
“When a man’s frost bitten they’ll agree to anything,” said Siemens. “I’ve converted a lot of people this way.”

Volkswagen Offers Customers Financial Compensation for the Embarrassment of Driving a Volkswagen,"WOLFSBURG, GERMANY
After executive Oliver Schmidt was sentenced to seven years in prison for the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the German automaker is now offering embarrassed customers financial compensation for the “utter humiliation of having to drive one of these beschissen VWs around for the next few years.”
“For years we’ve tried to market our cars as the hipper alternative to American cars,” said spokesperson Wilma Fischer. “Now most Americans wouldn’t be caught dead driving one of our vehicles. So, well, the court ordered us to pay them to do it.”
But the emissions scandal has not been the only factor contributing to the utter embarrassment people face while driving a VW.
“I’m not sure why people still buy our cars,” said Fischer. “I mean, we advertise as if our cars are actually ‘German’ but many of them are made by cheap labour in Mexico. Not to mention that our company was founded by Nazis. All around, it’s pretty verdammt embarrassing to drive a Volkswagen.”

Mennonite Couple Gets Second Bathroom,"LANDMARK, MB
After years of sharing the same washroom, local couple, Walter and Susanna Martens, have finally decided to upgrade their Landmark bungalow by adding a luxurious second bathroom.
“As soon as I saw those fancy tin commodes for sale at the Giant Tiger I snatched one up, brought it home, and put it under the bed,” said Walter. “This’ll be a real convenience during those 3 AM emergencies!”
Susanna says she has been trying to convince Walter to get a second bathroom for decades, but he’s always been reluctant to spend the money.

“Finally a bathroom I can call my own!” said Susanna. “This is going to change everything…and it’ll be a real lifesaver when the grandkids come over!”

Church with 250 Members Splits into 250 Churches,"LANCASTER, PA
After a particularly heated membership meeting this past week, the South Lancaster Mennonite Church has decided to split the entire congregation into more manageable units of one.
“At first we decided to just split into two groups: those in favour of buttons on their shirts and those who preferred hooks,” explained Johan Landes, former South Lancaster elder and recently appointed pastor of Johan Landes Memorial Church. “But then the button-users started talking amongst themselves and found they had differences of opinion on baptismal water temperature. Those wanting hot and those wanting cold split into their own groups. So then we had pro-button pro-cold, pro-button anti-cold, anti-button pro-cold and anti-button anti-cold groups. I figured it was settled, but upon further discussion, the groups realized they couldn’t agree on whether to sing five or six hymns each Sunday, and so there was an anti-button anti-cold pro-five group and an anti-button anti-cold pro-six group, and a pro-button anti-cold pro-five group and…well, you get the idea. The groups just kept getting tinier and tinier. Eventually we all decided to each form our own churches…but there was some opposition to this idea, too.”
The once thriving South Lancaster Church is now 250 (253 to be precise) individual churches, although the division has still not stopped.
“This whole starting-your-own-church thing has got me studying theology,” explained Landes. “And now I keeping changing church doctrine every day. I don’t even agree with myself anymore!”
Johan Landes says he has excommunicated his past-self for differences on clerical celibacy, but is concerned that a future version of himself might also disagree.
“Who knows what I might believe this Friday afternoon,” explained Johan Landes. “I always get a little too liberal when the weekend is approaching. Being my own pastor is a lot harder than I thought. You get so much criticism from all sides and it’s almost impossible to get the people to agree.”
Pastor Johan is arranging an ecumenical reconciliation service between his various selves for Sunday morning…although he can’t figure out whether they should use real wine or just Welch’s grape juice.

After Last Night Hanover Municipality Renamed ‘Hangover’,"HANGOVER, MB
After a night in which dozens of Mennonite in the Hanover area drank copious amounts of Papsi and water, area residents have voted to rename the area ‘Hangover.’
“Ugh, after three Papsis and a few glasses of water, I could hardly wake up this morning,” said Mrs. Martens. “I was so wasted, I even had to call in sick. Ugh.”
Hangover Muncipality was mistakenly thought to be dry, until it was recently revealed that no such law had ever been passed. In order to celebrate the new “wet municipality” status, residents have been downing cola like there’s no tomorrow.
“Normally I’m a Diet Papsi gal,” said Miss Unger, “but tonight I figured, what the heck, yet, let’s try a regular Papsi. It was fun while it lasted, but I regretted it in the morning.”
More than a thousand Hangover residents reported Papsi-releated headaches this morning.

Waffle iron makes its fourth and final waffle,"A WAFFLE iron received as a Christmas present has prepared the fourth and final waffle it will make before spending the rest of its life in a cupboard. 
The Breville-brand ceramic waffle iron, bought on a whim, has turned out tasty waffles enjoyed by the whole Logan family but that is not enough to save it.
Tom Logan, aged 41 and the receipient of the gift, said: “Yeah, it’s brilliant. Hot fresh waffles for a fraction of the price you’d pay if you were out. You have to make the mix though.
“The great thing about waffles is they go with everything, so you can whip them up whenever. You need lots of toppings though. So I’ll have to wait until I’ve got some stuff in.
“It’ll go in the cupboard for now, between the panini press and the breadmaker, but I should imagine I’ll have it out again next weekend. If not sooner.”
The iron will spend approximately two-and-a-half years in the cupboard before being wrongly assumed to be broken and taken to a charity shop which rejects it for having no valid electrical certificate.

"How to tackle red wine stains while knowing they’ll never, ever come out","TRY these handy methods of getting red wine stains out of your soft furnishings while simultaneously sobbing because you know they won’t work.
Cover the stain in salt
In theory salt absorbs the spill and cleverly makes the stain go away. In practice your beautiful white sofa is now covered in lots of dirty, boozy grit.
Pour white wine on it
While there might seem to be some weird logic in white wine being able to neutralise red, there is actually none. It’s bollocks and you’re just pissed.
Scrub it with soda water
In your desperation to save the cream carpet before your partner gets home you might believe that the magic bubbles will somehow ‘fizz’ the stain away. You are sadly mistaken.
Cut out the stain and cover up the hole with something
An act of desperation, but one you can get away with if you convince yourself and others that having a big pot plant obscuring the telly is an interesting interior design choice.
Start crying and pray for a miracle
The reality of the situation is that red wine stains never really come out and just hang around to remind you of being a clumsy, pissed-up twat. Definitely your best option.",NaN,4th January 2019,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/red-wine-stain-2.jpg,Fake
Government to provide emergency heating but only for awful Tory pensioners,"THE government is planning to supply emergency heaters, blankets and duvets to old folk, but only the ones who are diehard Conservatives.
Wizened bigots, golliwog owners and fans of the death penalty will be among those who will benefit from the kind gesture, so long as they vote Tory and not UKIP.
Junior health minister Denys Finch Hatton said: “As temperatures dip below zero, it is important our party membership doesn’t do the same.
“Priority will be given to the most horrible elderly Tories. If they keep banging on about immigration – or better still, apartheid – they’ll be as snug as a bug in a rug.
“We’ll be focusing on marginal constituencies, where warm winter woolies could mean the difference between life and death for the chances of our parliamentary candidates.
“This isn’t about shoring up our dwindling voter base, although if someone’s thinking of defecting we might tempt them back by installing a magnificent log fire and giving them a year’s supply of crumpets.” 
When criticised for not broadening the emergency heating plan to include all Britain’s pensioners, Finch Hatton decided to irrelevantly criticise Jeremy Corbyn.

How to remember what your crappy job is,"ARE you back at work but struggling to remember what you’re meant to be doing? Read our guide and find out.
What can you see?
If there’s a little TV with a plastic typewriter underneath, you probably work in an office. Sadly it’s not a proper TV and only shows ‘Microsoft Office’, although that’s increasingly more interesting than The Walking Dead.
If you’re surrounded by people in yellow hats you could work in construction. If you’re wearing a helmet inside a kind of glass dome you may be a fighter pilot. For fuck’s sake don’t press any buttons.
Is anyone flirting with you?
This could mean you work in an office with potential for romance. However, if you are just wearing a tiny thong and high heels you may be a lapdancer. Find out what ‘extras’ are before agreeing to anything.
How many legs have your co-workers got?
If it’s just two that suggests you work in admin, retail or the service sector. If it’s four you probably work on a farm or in an abattoir. Don’t get too attached to any of your ‘colleagues’, no matter how attractive they are.
Do people keep sending you weird electronic messages?
Again, evidence that you work in an office, particularly if the messages are workspeak bullshit, eg. “Great meeting. Totally across it re. new drainpipe catalogue. Jo and Suzanne really running some blue skies thinking up the flagpole as ever! I’ll be actioning all week. Jeff.”
Is everyone shorter than you?
A sure sign that you are a primary school teacher, particularly if they sometimes ask for help going to the toilet.
Another slim possibility is that you are Willy Wonka. Check to see if your workplace contains a chocolate river and a badly designed, potentially lethal air conditioning system. What you and the Oompa Loompas do outside work hours is your business.
Is everyone around you worthless fucking scum who don’t deserve a second of your precious time?

Man who’s been doing Dry January for four days can’t understand why he’s still fat,"A MAN who has been off the booze since the early hours of 1st January is baffled as to why he is still overweight.
Office worker Tom Booker, who spent New Year’s Eve drunkenly explaining how much he was looking forward to not drinking, has strangely not yet seen any benefits of Dry January.
Booker said: “Constantly consuming alcohol has turned me into a flabby, pale blob so I thought stopping would quickly reverse the process and turn me into that bloke who plays Thor.
“But it appears I was lied to. I haven’t lost any weight, even though I spent the best part of New Year’s Day vomiting up a combination of prosecco and Wotsits.
“I don’t know why everyone thinks Dry January is a good thing. All my friends say it’ll make me feel amazing, but I just feel depressed and chubby.
“I can’t even get pissed to cheer myself up. Frankly not drinking to excess and gorging on late-night snacks feels like a retrograde step.”

Sajid Javid’s guide to making up your own crisis,"INVENTING a crisis is exciting and makes you feel important if you’re a twat. Here home secretary Sajid Javid describes some great ones to try.
Asylum seeker crisis
This showed that I am both super-tough and an excellent future prime minister if you’re a racist voter or Tory party member. Kudos to me for thinking of such a brilliant strategy.
Workplace crisis 
In the absence of a real crisis like a fire, blow up a totally minor issue, eg. “EVERYONE LISTEN! I want you to keep calm, but I’m getting reliable reports that SOMEONE IS USING JOANNA’S MIFFY MUG.” 
Take charge and insist the culprit is put in a makeshift ‘detention centre’ you’ve built under your desk using chicken wire. Your boss is bound to be impressed by your vigilance.
Squirrel crisis 
Squirrels regularly invade Britain’s back gardens with no travel documentation and their alien nut-related ways. Draw up a plan as follows:
● Deter them by standing at the window shouting, “I can you see you, Tufty!”
● Devise a scheme to tag squirrels, with a custodial sentence if they leave their trees after 7am. 
● Run around the garden chasing them with a hammer. 
This will prove you are exactly the sort of stable, no-nonsense politician Britain needs.
Bubble bath crisis
No minister wants to be the one who ‘dropped the ball’ on the UK’s bubble bath supplies. You’ll be relieved to know I’ve just ordered 90 million bottles of Matey (and put out a press release about it, naturally).
Lost keys crisis

Greggs’ vegan sausage roll ‘is against the will of the people’,"THE introduction of vegan sausage rolls by Greggs could be the last straw for disaffected Northern communities, it has been warned.

“Gregg’s shelves are overcrowded as it is. That’s not veganist. We just don’t think soya protein substitute really tastes of anything.”

Your Brexit uncle
2018 was a great year for your Brexit uncle, who still has zero factual knowledge of what the EU is. His current obsessions are ‘WTO rules’ and the ‘gilets jaunes’. He doesn’t understand either, but does like bad things happening to the French.
Han Solo

Five vindictive things about Meghan Markle we just made up,"MEGHAN Markle is a hateful, conniving individual, if you just make shit up. Here’s some wild speculation about the – probably – horrible cow.
She ruined the Royal family’s Christmas
Meghan deliberately spoiled everyone’s Christmas dinner by turning the oven off so the turkey was raw and everyone had to have savoury biscuits instead.
She also ran over Princess Charlotte’s Elsa doll in her Range Rover until it was completely flat. There is no actual evidence for any of this, but it’s the sort of thing an evil shrew like Meghan would do.
She has 22 convictions for arson
Barns, factory buildings, primary schools – no unattended building is safe from Markle’s love of starting fires. Just as the Royals arrived at Sandringham for Christmas, a nearby tyre warehouse burned down. Coincidence? We think not.
Meghan is a terrible prog-rock bore
Known to listen to Tales From Topographic Oceans by Yes for up to 36 hours at a time, Markle also bores people senseless with her encyclopaedic knowledge of Rick Wakeman’s changing preferences in Moog keyboards.
Her lower jaw dislocates, allowing her to eat small dogs
Unbelievable, we know, but this chilling fact disgusts anyone unfortunate enough to witness the Duchess of Sussex gobbling down tiny dogs as well as live hamsters and gerbils. Recently several of the Queen’s corgis have mysteriously disappeared. The 1980s sci-fi drama V strongly suggests Meghan is responsible.
She only lets people watch Suits
Markle controls the festive TV viewing and only puts on DVDs of her own show Suits. At Sandringham this caused a row when Prince Philip wanted to watch Crank: High Voltage

Stop the Cavalry by Jona Lewie
You can have a perky parpy upbeat Christmas song, or you can have a song mourning the senseless deaths of soldiers in war. To try and do both in the same three-minute song is a catastrophic error and it’s we who suffer.
Christmas Wrapping by the Waitresses 
There was a time in the early 80s when rap was a joke genre only suitable for shitty novelty records produced as desperate cash-ins, like indie is today. A time forgotten until this comes on.

Five great places to get a few minutes bloody peace at Christmas,"ARE you tempted to cram yourself into the airing cupboard on Boxing Day for some precious ‘me time’? Here are some other excellent places to get away from your bastard relatives.
A desolate supermarket car park
For one day a year a windswept square of tarmac can become a beautiful oasis of peace and calm. Even the litter and dogshit will be more appealing than another game of Dobble.
The toilet
Give yourself an excuse to lock yourself in the toilet. Eat and drink way too much, or perhaps try licking the toilet brush to make yourself ill. Anything that allows you to sit on the bog in glorious, lonely bliss for ages.
The box that held the biggest present
Buy a relative something that requires a massive box like a fridge, then climb in until everyone has fucked off. The bonus is that you’ll look like a very generous present giver, if a bit weird.
The cupboard under the stairs
Offer to go looking for batteries or a corkscrew and bed down in a pre-arranged nest of blankets and a big bottle of gin. If nobody comes looking for you that’s a bit upsetting, but still worth it to avoid listening to Uncle Dave prattling on about Brexit.

Middle-aged office worker mortifies younger colleagues by photocopying his arse,"A MAN’S younger colleagues were left speechless when he dropped his trousers and sat on a photocopier to show them how we used to enjoy office Christmas parties.
After several glasses of prosecco, senior administrator Norman Steele, 56, decided the time had come to unbuckle and get the party going with some anal duplication.
Steele said: “Back in the day it wasn’t Christmas if you hadn’t plonked your sweaty buttocks on the photocopying machine and run off some copies of your bum crack.
“I made a beeline for the photocopier, undid my belt and hopped up on the glass screen while awkwardly fumbling with my underpants. I hit the green button and smudgy grey images of my bum started pouring out.
“I assumed I’d really broken the ice, but when I looked up they were all just staring at me in horror as if I was a sexual pervert. I think one of them was texting human resources.” 
Co-worker Tom Booker, 24, said: “Did people really do that? It’s disgusting. I mean there are serious hygiene issues. And if Norman wanted to expose himself he should really have got our consent.” 
Fellow office worker Nikki Hollis, 21, said: “When the photocopies came out I could see a grey blob that I’m sure was one of Norman’s testicles.

Brexit advent calendar has something bad behind every door,"PEOPLE who bought a Brexit advent calendar have discovered it goes on forever and every door conceals an unpleasant surprise.
As well as poor-quality gifts, the calendar has thousands of days to represent future trade negotiations, causing the ‘fun’ festive activity to drag on tediously.
Office manager Martin Bishop said: “We’d expected nice patriotic gifts like some luxury British chocolate, but when I opened today’s door there was just a crappy plastic figure of Andrea Leadsom.  
“On the 14th there was actually some chocolate, but it was that weird American type that tastes slightly greasy. Then on the 19th there was a small wooden banana. I’m not sure what I’m meant to do with that.” 
Fellow calendar owner Donna Sheridan said: “My Brexit advent calendar just goes on day after day with no end in sight. I’m getting sick of the whole thing. 
“I wouldn’t mind so much if the gifts were any good, but on Tuesday there was just a picture of Liam Fox. I had to go out and buy my young daughter a Freddo to stop her crying.

"Potatoes going to be crispy this year, say lying mums","BRITAIN’S mothers have yet again deceived their loved ones by claiming the roast potatoes will be crispy like the ones in food magazines.
Despite decades of soft, greasy potatoes, gullible families are still being conned into thinking this year they will receive a crunchy, yet still fluffy, miracle.
Mum Carolyn Ryan said: “Every year I make outlandish claims about crispy edges and feathery light interiors, and every year it’s the same yellowish, oily, mediocre potatoes. 
“I can make them ‘crispy’ by overcooking them so much you can crush diamonds with them, but even that’s a hassle compared to just sticking them in the oven and having a glass of port.
“Most years I pretend to open the same jar of goose fat that’s been there since 2004 and promise to parboil them. Do I? Do I fuck.

Uncle test-flying nephew’s Christmas present in deep shit,"AN uncle who gave his nephew’s Christmas drone a sneaky test flight is worried he might not get it back without complications. 
Joseph Turner of Crawley thought he would give the £65 drone “a quick go” but lost control and is unsure where it went, other than near “a big wide empty road”.
He said: “If I’ve scuffed the casing, I can probably get the marks off with a damp cloth. But it could be considerably worse than that. 
“The camera’s not that great – it looked better on the box – but I got the impression it might have flown into the general area of Gatwick. Where all that fuss is. I hope it’s not related. 
“At least with all the policemen everywhere one of them’s bound to find it, but the danger is I won’t get it back before the 23rd, which doesn’t leave time to charge the battery and get it wrapped. 
“Anyway, it definitely works. I think Jack will have lots of fun with it. If the worst comes to the worst I’m pretty sure you’re allowed to send presents from prison.”

Office worker Tom Logan said: “It’s the kind of thing you’d say if the woman at the sandwich shop totally buggered up your order and acted like it was your fault. 
“Yes, you should have waited until you were outside the shop but no, technically she is stupid and a woman. So it’s swings and roundabouts really. 
“Would I be cross if he’d said it to my mum? Yes. If it was my dad saying it, who has to put up with the frustration of dealing with her day in, day out? Not so much.

Geordies remind Northerners they’re actually Southerners,"THE inhabitants of Newcastle have reminded Northerners that they are soft Southerners who wear coats in winter and know about pesto. 
Newcastle’s observations throw into doubt decades of boasting by Yorkshire and Lancashire that their cities are the last word in grit, grimness and crap weather.
Leading geordie Roy Hobbs said: “Sorry to shatter your illusions but you’re 150 miles from the proper North. You may as well be having ballet lessons in Cheltenham.
“You think your accents are coarse and incomprehensible? Bollocks. You could be reading the news on Radio 4. Not like us, who sound as if we’re trying to swallow mugs of hot tar while we’re talking. 
“Our industries collapsed before yours did, our whippets are thinner than yours and we’ve got weirder unhealthy things in our chip shops, like eggs deep-fried in cheese.”
Hobbs confirmed that a recent drop in temperatures to below zero meant he would be dispensing with his winter t-shirt and going bare-chested to avoid feeling “hot and sticky”.

How to have a gammon Christmas,"CHRISTMAS is a time for being bloody angry and having political correctness rammed down your throat. Here’s how to have a furious Little Englander Christmas.
Make up things to get angry about
They’re probably going to ban turkey in case it offends people from Turkey, right? Well, no, that would be ridiculous. But don’t let it stop you getting annoyed about it.
Let your imagination roam free and invent terrible things the EU and ‘PC brigade’ plan to do to Christmas as if they were real, eg. diversity quotas for Santa’s elves.
Watch Doctor Who purely so you can vent
You know Doctor Who is pretty right-on these days, so make sure you watch every second of this sickening travesty. Don’t enjoy getting angry too much and punch the screen in, because The Dam Busters is bound to be on at some point.
Plan your festive arguments 
Gammons love ranting, so make a schedule, eg. ’23 December: Tell that idiot Charlotte to get her head out of her fucking arse about the federal European superstate. Remember to wrap her Elsa doll.’
Build an aggressively un-PC snowman
If it snows, build a snowman in the shape of a golliwog, spray paint it black, post the images on Facebook and wonder why you’ve suddenly lost your job.
Binge-watch Question Time
If you’ve recorded lots of episodes of Question Time on your Sky box you’ve basically got a huge box set similar to the The Walking Dead but starring wankers such as Farage and Isabel Oakeshott.  
Get snuggled up under the duvet and enjoy your favourite classic episodes, like the one where a Labour MP is unconvincingly trying to be pro- and anti-immigration at the same time.
Plan a January detox
However much you’ve enjoyed a gammon Christmas, it’s important to reduce your blood pressure. Eat more salads and only rant about ‘snowflakes’ twice a day. ",NaN,20th December 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/gammon-2.jpg,Fake
Bachelor steps up preparations for no-deal Brexit,"A SINGLE man living alone has stepped up preparations for a no-deal Brexit by buying 24 tins of all-day breakfast and three crates of Stella. 
Nathan Muir of Leeds has also laid in 48 Pot Noodles, a full cupboard of teabags and six litres of vodka as anaesthetic in case he has to perform surgery on himself. 
He said: “The freezer’s stocked with burgers, chicken burgers, chicken strips and fish fingers, which I can eat on their own if I can’t get bread for fish finger sandwiches. Got to be adaptable. 
“I haven’t got everything – I’ve not seen Moody Tony down the pub, so I’ve not been able to bulk-buy my smuggled tobacco yet – but there’s a six-pack of lighters all ready. 
“And on DVD I’ve got highlights of every Premier League season since 2005, all the Top Gears, and the porn that Matt left when he moved in with Lucy. Think there’ll be streaming? Dream on. 
“I’m ready for no-deal. When they’re out on the streets fighting to the death for a bottle of ketchup I’ll still be dipping my fries. Bring it on.”

Family that didn’t send Christmas cards suffers no ill effects whatsoever,"A FAMILY that has opted not to send Christmas cards this year is reporting no negative consequences whatsoever. 
The Fisher family had feared being shunned for their lack of cardboard-based salutations, but confirmed their worries had been completely unfounded.
Mary Fisher explained: “I was making a Christmas card list and suddenly started to think about all the time and money I’ve spent on seasons greetings over the years.
“Then the idea hit me like a bolt of lightning: why not just fucking not bother? We decided we’ll still say Merry Christmas when we see people, using our words, rather than a series of overpriced multipacks from Marks and Spencer, and 15 quid’s worth of stamps.”
The Fishers’ concerns that they would be cast out from society, or subjected to enquiries about their wellbeing after failing to appear in card form, were quickly put to rest with the discovery that pretty much no one gives a shit about Christmas cards.  
The move has ended several friendships that were based solely on the annual exchange of Christmas cards, but this is also being considered a win for all involved, except Royal Mail. 
The decision hasn’t yet, however, saved them from receiving upwards of 50 cards and Aunt Joan’s remarkably passive-aggressive annual family newsletter.  ",NaN,19th December 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/fam667-3.jpg,Fake

Avoid militarist films
Reject capitalist war profiteering by not watching militarist propaganda like The Great Escape. I will also be avoiding superhero films due to their sickening elitism.
Have a marrow-based dinner
I love having people over for a sumptuous Christmas dinner, so I’ll be making my famous boiled marrow. Make sure your guests definitely get the invitation or there’s a danger no one will turn up, like last year.
Buy left-wing presents
Everyone loves socialist Christmas presents. This year I’m getting my wife a fascinating book I discovered called From Nye Bevan to Neoliberalism: Changing Economic Challenges Facing the Modern Welfare State. At 804 pages it’ll last a lot longer than a bottle of Chanel No. 5!
Be ‘revolutionary’ with your tree
Instead of a fairy on top of your tree, challenge bourgeois conservatism and put a scowling figure of Leon Trotsky up there.
Don’t forget the young socialists!
This year all my young relatives will be getting action figures from a wonderful non-profit socialist toy shop I found in Islington. I can’t wait to see them having adventures with Bearded 1980s CND Man and Earnest Middle Class Activist Woman.

How to cope when you’re five days deep into a festive hangover,"HAVE you been to some sort of Christmas ‘do’ five nights in a row and forgotten what it feels like to not be hungover? Here’s how to deal with it.
Drink more
The mere thought of alcohol might make you want to weep, but you have at least seventeen more Christmas things to go to and you definitely won’t enjoy them sober.
Have a big self-indulgent moan
Obviously whining because you chose to drink three bottles of wine and fall asleep in a kebab shop is annoying, but you can get away with it because everyone else is doing it too.
Carry a tub of Celebrations everywhere as an emotional crutch
Any notion of looking after your diet will have long since been abandoned so stuffing your face with chocolate can only help. Plus you can vomit in the tub if necessary.
Remind yourself that everything ends eventually
Even if you feel like the only way to escape the endless festive hangover is through the sweet release of death, try not to despair as Christmas will eventually end and your liver will start functioning again.

The best places to make an obnoxious hands-free call,"DO you love shouting inanely into thin air while doing your supermarket shop? Here are some other great places to ‘multitask’ in annoyingly.
Doctors’ waiting rooms
Ill people are rarely feeling their best and may be experiencing anxiety. Add to it by talking loudly about your own symptoms or something terrifying such as a person you read about who died of toenail cancer.
On the bus
Buses are basically big moving boxes full of misery. So why not shout aggressively into your phone about some work aggro like ‘Tina’s useless. FUCKING USELESS…’, or just anything that will generally depress people?
In a public toilet
There are two things you should be doing in a public toilet, and neither of them are having a long chat with a friend about whether you’ve got cystitis or your tights are just too small.
The gym
Gyms are hideous enough as it is, but you can make it even worse for everyone with a hands-free call that you shout over the loud, pounding music whilst running on a treadmill. Bonus twat points if it’s your lunch break and you’re talking about ‘business’.

How to deal with arsehole relatives this Christmas,"IF you’re cursed with visiting relatives this Christmas it will inevitably harm your festive fun. Here’s how to minimise the grief at this most joyous time of year.
Board game bastards
Board games are not only tedious but relatives always have their own bizarre version of the rules, eg. in Monopoly, every time you go to jail you get $500 for wrongful arrest.
Solution: Trivial Pursuit et al have been destroyed in a mysterious ‘board game fire’. Doddery 85-year-old Auntie Lynne will just have to go on a steep learning curve with Call of Duty.
Outdoorsy tossers
Sure as night follows day some relative will want to go for a very long walk in the countryside, which won’t be a delightful winter wonderland but instead more like a muddy yomp in the Falklands. 
Solution: It was just on the radio that there’s been an outbreak of anthrax. Looks like we’d better open more wine and watch Toy Story 3.
Teenagers who don’t want to be there
This is actually fair enough, but standing in a corner texting and moodily sighing really isn’t getting into the festive spirit.
Solution: Express grave concerns about your stocks of mince pies/bread sauce/milk and take the teens for a nostalgic evening of drinking cider and smoking crap weed in the park of their choice.
Joyless miseries
Every family has some miserable sod or soddette who just wants to whine about other people’s child rearing or the central heating not coming on at 4am.
Solution: Lock them in a bedroom for the duration with a black-and-white TV, a bucket of water, some Jacob’s Cream Crackers and a small piece of mild Cheddar. The misery will make it their best Christmas ever! 
Political arguers 
A family Christmas inevitably brings together people with opposing political views. Unfortunately after too many glasses of wine Uncle Steve and Uncle Pete will be going at it like Enoch Powell arguing with Trotsky.
Solution: Have a pre-prepared list of utterly insane political arguments that will disarm the combatants with their mentalness, eg. “Why aren’t trees allowed to vote? Tell me that, Steve!”

Full-time drinker’s heart sinks at prospect of part-time drinkers,"A HARDENED drinker’s slightly diseased heart has sunk at the prospect of his boozing sessions being interrupted by loud, tipsy Christmas parties.
Roy Hobbs, 54, who drinks 13 pints a day in the Dog & Duck in Aylesbury, feels his Christmas is in danger of being ruined by excessive occasional drinking.
Hobbs said: “I’ve nothing against people enjoying a dangerous amount of alcohol, just so long as they can handle it and sit quietly in the corner of the pub doing a crossword.
“It really unsettles me when the once-a-year drinkers pile in, already slightly inebriated at the prospect of becoming slightly inebriated, as late as 1.15pm.
“I like a quiet pub where I can get immensely pissed without having a friendly conversation or appearing to enjoy myself in any way at all.
“But these people start flailing around the pub with their Christmas hats being all flirty and jolly. Where’s the dignity in getting totally shitfaced like that?

‘What if I’m actually a dickhead?’ Boris Johnson wonders aloud,"FOR the first time Boris Johnson has realised he might not be a great statesman and future prime minister but just a dickhead. 
Johnson, who has long maintained that beneath his buffoonish exterior lies a steely political operator, today stared into the mirror and saw nothing but a buffoon staring back. 
He said: “This is a ridiculous thought, but what if – indulge me – I’m actually exactly the absurd clown I seem? 
“For example, I thought I was being supremely clever when I led the Leave campaign, knowing it couldn’t win but I’d put myself in pole position for Downing Street. But it did win, and everything’s gone wrong since.
“Could that in some way be my fault? 
“And when I got given a proper job I was shit at it. I told myself it was a canny move stoking Britain’s populist xenophobia, but maybe I’m just shit at jobs?
“Perhaps my unaccountable failure to become prime minister, which I assumed was just bad luck, is because I’m a fat, lying sack of shit who shags any passing posh bird and who nobody trusts an inch?

Muir said: “When she gave up sugar I could handle it, and I was even prepared to be understanding about her not drinking during the week, but cheese is sacred.
“Whilst Nikki has many excellent qualities she is, like all of us, at her very best when holding a small cracker that is falling to pieces under the weight of a massive lump of Cheddar.
“Hopefully it’s just a phase because if I look to the future and imagine her forever holding just a miserable stick of celery and a tub of hummus I can feel my love for her melting away like a wheel of Brie left in the sun.”

The British person’s guide to rioting,"THE French have done some good rioting recently, but is our famous ‘English reserve’ stopping us sorting out our grievances by setting fire to cars? Read our guide to smashing shit up.
Stop being so tediously polite
British people are proud of their pleasant manners, but this only leads to docile, painfully middle-class marches. Instead use a rolled-up Observer food supplement as the lighter in your petrol bomb.
Learn from our neighbours
The French will smash up shops on the Champs-Élysées at the drop of a baguette. The next time a Twix goes up in price at your local garage, drive your car through the window.
Be motivated by something other than looting Sports Direct
Trainers are comfy, but if you’re only out on the streets to to nick a pair of Nike Air Max we’ll never successfully stick it to the man. Unless that man is Mike Ashley. And to be fair, Sport Direct is a valid target if you’re sick to death of being pestered to buy insoles.
Use your Twitter hatred
If the amount of seething, bitter vitriol that’s put into attacking people in 280 characters was put into rioting it would make the French Revolution look like a quiet night in with your nan.
Realise you already have rioting skills

Atheists’ advent calendar just contains cold hard facts,"AN atheist family’s advent calendar contains nothing but reason and cold hard facts.

Vote for vote may trigger votes then vote followed by other vote,"TONIGHT’S confidence vote may trigger a leadership vote in the Commons followed by a vote of Conservative members then a referendum, say experts. 
If this evening’s vote goes against Theresa May then a leadership contest will see MPs take part in multiple rounds of voting before party members vote. The public may then vote in either a general election or a referendum, all of which is great news for fans of voting. 
Parliamentary correspondent Mary Fisher said: “It’s vote-tastic over here. It’s vote Christmas. It’s raining votes. Democracy is back in a major bullshit way. 
“Ironically all this began when Theresa May, who doesn’t like voting because other people get it wrong, cancelled a vote. Whooo-eee. Did that backfire. 
“It may be that tonight’s vote is the only one, because if May wins by a single vote she’ll claim it as an overwhelming majority to pursue whatever extreme Brexit totalitarian state she wants. 
“But if not, then the voting could never stop. We could have a leadership vote then a general election then a referendum. That’s not even unlikely.

Professor Henry Brubaker said: “I expected Britons to be demanding a fairer society, but it was more things like hating people in the next town for having a slightly better bus service.
“Many of the economic and geographic divides turned out to be weird made-up bollocks, like thinking employers immediately put your job application in the bin if you’re from the North.

Ryanair to compensate passengers by never letting them fly Ryanair again,"RYANAIR has agreed to compensate passengers whose flights were cancelled by banning them from flying Ryanair ever again.
Passengers owed hundreds of pounds have enthusiastically embraced the deal which they have called ‘more than we could ever have hoped for’.
Sue Traherne, from Bolton, said: “Just to know that when you browse flights that you won’t give in and pick the cheapest option because you’re actually banned gives me such peace of mind.
“They’ve circulated our names, our passport numbers and our photographs so there is absolutely no way they can go back on this. It doesn’t feel real saying this, but we’ve flown Ryanair for the last time.

The best winter coats to keep out the creeping dread of Christmas,"As well as keeping you warm, a good winter coat can shield you from the endless bullshit of Christmas, especially if you keep the hood up. Here are five of the best.
Duffle coat
Duffle coats should only be worn by children, which means that adult wearers will be protected by an armour of optimistic excitement about the festive season. They will also look like total idiots.
Sequinned bomber jacket
Allows you to disappear into the general tacky, sparkly, naffness of Christmas and therefore it won’t be able to get you. MI6 call it ‘hiding in plain sight’, but probably in relation to more serious matters.
High performance technical raincoat
People who love outdoor clothing are always banging on about taped seams and hydrophobic fabrics that keep out water, so wearing one of these is bound to stop Christmas seeping in, even after prolonged exposure.
A long, black cloak
Are you Dracula, the Grim Reaper or the Ghost of Christmas past? It doesn’t matter really, as you’re so scary and anti-festive that all Christmas bullshit will automatically bypass you.
Ankle length puffer jacket
As it is essentially a duvet, this coat is the sartorial equivalent of going to bed for the whole of Christmas and not getting up again until March.",NaN,4th December 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/wintercoat-667x375.jpg,Fake

"So-called ‘women’s cars’ have no female genitalia, discover experts","VEHICLES described by men as ‘women’s cars’ do not have breasts or a vagina, experts have discovered.
The ‘women’s cars’ were given a thorough examination but nothing gender specific was discovered, despite a stereo button having a passing resemblance to an erect nipple.
Professor Henry Brubaker, of the Institute for Studies, said: “There’s a lot of confusion, but cars are genderless lumps of metal and plastic, like snails that ruin the environment.
“Some alpha males refer to cars as ‘she’ because they’re too insecure to consider the idea of riding a man into work.
“Some cars have been labeled ‘women’s cars’ by petrol-head chauvinists because slagging off an MX-5 helps them deal with the fact that their wives have left them.
“We also found no evidence of hairdressers in ‘hairdresser’s cars’.”

“The overarching baddie for the series is capitalism – obviously – but we’re dealing with that in all its vile manifestations such as the meat industry, the police, the gender binary and Western science.
“In the special the Doctor arrives in the devastated Britain of 1988, joins the courageous resistance fighting the Thatcher dictatorship, and executes the PM. The last five minutes is happy multicultural Britain dancing around her head on a spike.”

"Is splitting the bill evenly a good idea, or do you have no concept of money?","YOU’VE enjoyed a marvellous meal with friends and now the bill has arrived. Should you just divide the whole thing equally, or do you actually understand how money works? 
Take our quiz:
Who are you dining with? 
A) My good friends, who’ve been looking forward to this get-together all week as have I.
B) Some acquaintances who call themselves friends who I don’t like that much and certainly have no qualms about casually allowing to suffer for my pleasure.
How pricey is the restaurant? 
A) Nice but not what you’d call expensive, with an affordable wine list.
B) I don’t care. It’s not my problem.
What are you ordering?
A) No starter, a mid-range main course and perhaps a pudding if I’m feeling indulgent.
B) A starter I won’t eat, Waygu steak, a side dish, three bottles of wine, the cheese board, a couple of single malts between courses.
What is money? 
A) A token of payment used for goods and services, and there’s never bloody enough of it, is there! Haha. Please God don’t suggest we split the bill.
B) You know, I’m not really sure. I’ve never had to worry about it.
ANSWERS
Mostly As: Of course you shouldn’t split the bill, even if it is a pain in the arse totting up. And put in for the tip.

Bishop said: “I see nothing wrong with telling people I used to be an RAF fighter pilot or ran a successful wine importing business. It just gives me a competitive edge over people who tell the truth.

Five great ways to obstruct people in public,"DO you like pissing people off with your big rucksack or stupid little dog on a massive lead? Here’s how to take being a pain in the arse in public places to a new level.
Stop at the top of an escalator
There’s no way people using an escalator could be in a hurry to get somewhere, so stop, relax and take in the view. Perhaps have a conversation with your companions, or generally dick around. That won’t make people want to punch you very hard.
Wear a fucking massive rucksack
A huge rucksack is the classic item for hitting people in the face every time you turn round. Refuse to take it off on the bus and get one made from extra scratchy material for the maximum effect when people get a faceful of it. 
Stand in a doorway
Stopping just the other side of a threshold so that the person behind can’t help but bump into you is superb. Bonus points if you turn and glare at them as if they’re the irritating fuckwit.
Dawdle along with a pushchair, a toddler and a dog
You’re living a perfect middle-class existence, so why not share it with people who might need to go somewhere urgently? Turn busy streets into an obstacle course, particularly if you’re just ambling to Waitrose for a pot plant to kill some time before ‘wine o’clock’.
Stand in a group of bantering twats
Whether you’re outside a pub or just blocking the pavement whilst absorbed in your own bullshit, everyone trying to get past hates you.

Are those teenagers laughing at you?,"IF a group of young people start giggling when you walk past, you could be the victim of mockery by little shits. But how can you be sure? Read our guide and find out. 
What sort of trainers are you wearing? 
Maybe those day-glo £165 Adidas trainers were wrong for a plump 42-year-old. Or maybe they just aren’t cool according to some arcane teenage knowledge. They’re the dicks because they’re pawns of Nike’s marketing, but they are definitely laughing at you. 
Have you got a strange affectation?
Perhaps you wear a bowtie in the mistaken belief you look like a raffish intellectual, when in fact you look more like a circus clown, or simply a twat? In this case the teenagers are right. 
Ditch any wanker’s style choices, including: outback jackets with a bushranger hat when you live in Birmingham, using a cane when you don’t need one and fob watches.
Is there an unfortunate thing about your appearance you can do nothing about?
You may have a general air of geekiness like Ed Miliband, or an odd, lolloping gait like a Muppet. Kids can be cruel, but let’s face it, you are pretty funny.
Have you been using outdated youth argot?
It’s possible the teenagers have overheard you yapping on your phone using outdated terms in an embarrassing way, eg. “Quentin made a lovely lasagne and we chilled out with some ganj.”
However teenagers also routinely use odd phrases like “feeling ya, bruv” so go over like a stern teacher and tell them to stop being fucking hypocrites. End your lecture if a 13-year-old girl starts crying because – ridiculously – you could look like the bully.
Are you older than 25 but riding a skateboard?
Sorry. We have no sympathy.
Conclusion: If you haven’t done any of these things your teenage tormentors are probably just laughing randomly at some pathetic bollocks like Hayley texting Liam to say Callum is ‘fake’. 
However if you have in some way offended teenage sensibilities, take comfort in the fact that with their ridiculously tight jeans and gormless phone-staring they are twats too.",NaN,30th November 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/teenagers-2-1.jpg,Fake

Do you remember why you voted for Brexit?,"IN JUNE 2016,  you voted for Britain to leave the European Union. But do you have any idea why you did this or is it lost in the mists of time? 
Did you want Britain to be free to trade with countries around the world? 
A) No, I don’t think I was bothered about that. Isn’t it already?
B) Yes! That was it. I was sick of being tied into reductive EU trade deals that don’t take into account the massive economic heft of our organic pear juice.
Was it because you were sick of human rights? 
A) Okay, I get that it sounds weird now, but possibly. I mean you had to be there.
B) Yes! Murderers serving life were getting PlayStations and all the adult channels, then getting released! I knew I had a good reason.
Did you want the NHS to get an extra £350 million a week? 
A) Don’t get me wrong I like the NHS, but that seems excessive. Wouldn’t that make it richer than, like, Google?
B) Yes! And it will!
It wasn’t because you’re racist, was it?
A) Not racist as such. Perhaps slightly more susceptible to racism. It’s genetic.
B) No! It definitely wasn’t that at all, and anyone who says that is the reason Brexit happened is so wrong!
Do you actually want Brexit now? 
A) Is it ungrateful if I say no? I don’t want to make a scene.
B) Yes! For all the reasons mentioned above, and any others!

“You cross the border and it seems distinctive with the bilingual signs and everything, but then it’s largely unpopulated and is either seaside, mountains or these tiny little cities.
“I thought they might be helpful for Brexit since they voted for it, but apparently they’re not really sure and mostly vote Labour or this party I’ve never heard of called Plaid Cymru. Four MPs. Makes the Lib Dems look big.

What’s your bullshit middle-class parenting style?,"ARE you convinced you’ve got a brilliant parenting style, when really it’s just some bollocks you read in a Sunday supplement? Read our guide and find out.
‘Having mature agreements’
What you think: Little Jack tidying his bedroom for six weeks in return for a Playstation game is a great way of teaching him about responsibility.
Reality: A chaotic system of bribery involving sweets and toys in which your children will come to believe everything they do must involve a reward and they can demand £20 for doing a poo.
‘Encouraging their creativity’
What you think: Your relaxed parenting style will cause your child to become a famous writer and you’ll be showered with champagne and kudos at their book launches.
Reality: You take your children to restaurants, fail to control them in any way and get sloshed while they run around calling other diners ‘paedos’ despite having no idea what it means.
‘Treating them like adults’ 
What you think: Talking to them about adult things and involving them in decisions will make them wonderfully mature.
Reality: A lifetime of therapy after you explained daddy’s inability to give mummy an orgasm and took them to see the family dog being put down. 
‘Hands-off parenting’ 
What you think: Encouraging their independence means your kids are going to be bold, self-reliant adults, probably round-the-world yachtspersons!
Reality: You mostly remember to feed them but they spend a lot of time subsisting on Haribo and using their iPad to visit the darkest recesses of the internet. Would involve social services if you didn’t have a Volvo.

Five entertaining ways to trigger a gammon,"ANGRY red-faced men are always criticising ‘snowflakes’ but are surprisingly easily triggered themselves. Why not set them off with these made-up ‘facts’?
The army is becoming transgender
Gammons will accept any bollocks about certain hot topics, so tell them every British squaddie is being forced to change sex. The Paras are changing their name to The Girly Gender Benders Regiment. 
If you’re feeling particularly sadistic, add plenty of ‘convincing’ detail, eg. the SAS will have to wear sports bras to support their impressive norks while storming embassies, and one of their ammo pouches will be reserved for tampons.
Millennials will get free protective suits
Young people are so delicate they’re getting padded suits to protect them from everyday life. A high-tech helmet will block out offensive sights such as people eating steak and normal heterosexual blokes giving their wife a playful pat on the arse. 
Being a white male is becoming illegal
Gammons often mention this, but are they aware it’s really happening thanks to the upcoming Pub Bore Resettlement Act 2018? This fictitious piece of legislation will force them to live in politically correct camps where they have to sing Baa Baa Rainbow Lesbian Sheep all day.
Any extremely unbelievable garbage about Islam
● To avoid upsetting Muslims, Crufts is going to replace dogs with mice.
● Big Ben is now a mosque. Regional gammons hate London, so this is clearly true.
● Dentists are becoming halal. This does not even make sense but they’ll still be furious. 
May’s secret deal to become part of France  
Gammons hate ‘remain traitor’ Theresa May with a vengeance because she’s not quite daft enough to deliver their precious hard Brexit. So tell them we’re becoming part of France.

Logan said: “It started off with just a quick argument – I shared a tweet with an opinion about Brexit, and a man commented saying I was a ‘fucking nonce’ and I should kill myself.
“I replied that he was being a bit harsh, and threw in some stats about Brexit. Harmless.
“But then, before I knew it, I was hooked. I started actively looking for people posting ill-advised tweets, and taking it upon myself to correct their information and share my perspective.
“I got so used to trying to prove a point to idiots online that I forgot that I have a life outside of the internet with nice people that aren’t going to threaten to murder me because I have a different political opinion to them.

Husband John said: “Mary loves the time I went mountain biking with my German pen friend. You can tell because she laughs so much.”
Mary Fisher said: “I might just say the punch line and watch his face drop or interrupt at the final moment with a needless question, I’m not yet sure.
“Now I must wait and laugh like a hapless buffoon hiding my venom like the anecdote assassin I have become.
“If all goes well he will get annoyed, his voice will go quite high, he might even try and tell me off in front of the guests, I can barely wait.

CORGI
The Queen’s dogs, these pampered princes strut around baffled as to why they live in your pauper’s cottage. Pretend they’re not with you if off the lead. Consider it an honour for you to pick up their shit.
PUG
Squat, ugly and pedigree, pugs are the curtain-twitching middle-class Daily Mail readers of the canine world, stumping around your house judging you for your liquid soap dispenser, your big television and your dusty pelmets.
COCKAPOO
Arriviste social climbers unaware of how gauche they are, this breed rejects antique furniture and 17th century farmhouses in favour of a brand new Wimpey home where the kitchen’s replaced every four years. Doesn’t understand why anyone lives any other way.
ALSATIAN
Basically security guards. Likes pornography and a copy of the Puzzler. Would join the police but their mate down the lamppost says they’re only hiring foreign dogs now. As working class as it gets.
LABRADOR
Traditionally a working dog, but thanks to being kept as a pet it is unable to work and just sits at home, watching daytime TV, with no pride left. It is a member of the underclass and attempted to vote for Brexit.
MIXED BREED

Explained: The six possible Brexit shitshows,"THE UK has reached a Brexit crossroads, but which ill-advised choice will we make and which completely avoidable shitshow will we stumble idiotically into? 
May deal passed by Commons
This scenario, requiring half of Labour, most of the Tories and fuck it the SNP to back a Brexit deal way worse than our status quo, condemns Britain to a twilit half-life trapped in and out of the EU like a ghost haunting the place of its murder waiting for someone to investigate but nobody is.
May deal rejected by Commons
This scenario, considered extremely likely because everyone a) hates Theresa May and b) wants to see what will happen, gives the prime minister 21 days to come up with a new deal. 21 days for someone whose last new idea was in 1998. Come on. That’ll be worth watching.
May replaced as leader by extreme Brexiter
Expected to make the EU quake in terror, it will instead cause them to walk away from negotiations muttering “Fuck this,” and seal the Channel Tunnel with concrete. Britain will then enjoy a wonderful, nostalgic re-run of its glory days in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. 
Extension of Article 50
The EU decides, given the level of the debate so far, to treat Britain like a toddler told he can definitely drive Daddy’s car next weekend. Consecutive indefinite extensions will leave Britain delighted it’s getting its Brexit without realising it will never arrive.
Second referendum
Forcing Nigel Farage out of retirement like Rambo in the 2008 film, this restages the referendum on the basis that enough people have come to their senses or died since then. Overestimating the intelligence and underestimating the death wish of the UK sees the same result returned, to the exact vote.
War

The Brexiter’s guide to what’s British,"SINCE June 24th, 2016, it has become apparent that some things which claim to be British are anything but, and only loyal Brexiters can tell the difference. 
Here’s the ultimate Brexiter’s guide to what is British and what will leave our shores forever when the Sacred Emerald is placed in the Queen’s crown to bring Brexit to completion.
The British legal system – not British. Based on the Magna Carta, clearly not native to these shores as it has a foreign name, the British legal system has spent centuries convicting British people who must logically be innocent by virtue of their nationality.
The BBC – not British. The ‘British’ in the BBC’s name is a Trojan horse which sneaks multicultural propaganda into the homes and hearts of decent patriots. All BBC News programmes have been entirely fictional since 1964.
News International – British. This US-owned media corporation is as British as steak-and-ale pie, dog-fighting in rural barns and Oxo.
16,141,241 Remain voters – not British. Probably Brazilian. Go back to Brazil.
Winning World War II – British. America was involved at the very, very end, for between five and ten minutes. Russia had no idea it was even going on.
Parliament – not British. None of them were elected. They were all appointed by a cabal of elite judges who are all homosexuals.",NaN,18th November 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake

Could you be the next useless Brexit secretary?,"HAVE you got what it takes to be the next ambitious twat to pick up the poison chalice of Brexit? Take our quiz and find out.
Do you own a sharp suit? 
A Brexit secretary must look smart and professional. This will buy you time before everyone realises you’re a bit dense with a crap 2:2 in English from Oxford.
Do you like doing things you later regret?
Maybe you insist on going to parties that are clearly going to be shit then wish you’d stayed at home eating crisps? Or perhaps you once put your penis in a vacuum cleaner and had to go to A&E? You could be Brexit minister material.
Are you all mouth and no trousers?
Do you like sounding off about things but never actually doing anything? This will come in handy when you need to make offensive comments about the EU, eg. “Britain will be making a ‘GREAT ESCAPE’ from the EU! See what I did there?”
Do you like pretending to read things? 
Do you carry an impressive-looking novel around but never actually read it? This will be a useful skill when you can’t be arsed to read any Brexit documents then wonder why clever Monsieur Barnier is looking at you like an idiot.
Have you ever bought an Ikea wardrobe and realised you are hopelessly out of your depth?
If you’re not up to the slightly complex task of assembling flat-pack furniture you’re not going to stand a chance with EU regulations. Luckily the government is extremely desperate, so get your job application in now.
If you answered mainly ‘yes’ you could have a great career as Brexit secretary. By which we mean you’ll faff about for a bit then resign when you realise it’s all going wrong and you might get strung from a lamp post at your next constituency surgery.

Basically say your co-workers are shit 
Gary keeps forgetting to copy you into emails, Lucy is too chatty and Rob eats his sandwiches in a distracting way. There’s no way a business genius like you can be expected to work in this hellish environment.
Your boss isn’t ‘inspiring’ you
It’s unclear how your hapless line manager not having the leadership skills of General George Patton is causing you to turn up late with a hangover every morning, but it’s worth a try.
Luckily many bosses read bullshit business books with titles like Crossing the Business Rubicon: How to Lead Like Caesar, so they will probably agree with you, the twats.
Learn from the bellends on The Apprentice
These tossers are masters of evading responsibility when their business plan to sell vindaloo baby food or whatever goes tits up. Try things like: “Sasha was disrespecting my input as project manager when I was trying to keep it real.” Remember not to add “Sir Alan”.
Use wanky business jargon
This works best in large companies where corporate drivel is the lingua franca. Say things like “Simon hasn’t been keeping me in the loop” or “Rebecca isn’t proactively intra-strategising me in the feedback synergy.”
Note: Less effective in small businesses in the North where your boss will simply ask you if you want a toe up your arse.
Demand to have every trivial piece of shit confirmed
You MUST have an email confirming you’re meant to go to meetings or exhibitions you’re clearly meant to attend. Otherwise you’ll just sit at your desk eating cashews and playing World of Warships.

They’re just tired

They’re just ‘testing boundaries’
Try saying things like: “It may look like he just kicked you in the bollocks, but actually he’s testing boundaries. He knows he shouldn’t do it now, and your bollocks helped with that. Good for you.”
It’s the ‘terrible twos’ 
Say: “I’m so sorry my child shat in your shoe – it’s the terrible twos!” For best results accompany this with a helpless shrug and look like you’re on the verge of tears. People will immediately sympathise – and the great thing is you can use this excuse for a whole year!
They’re hungry
“She only tried to gouge your eye out with a plastic fork because she hasn’t eaten for six minutes!”. She’s definitely not already exhibiting psychopathic tendencies. No. Although she is attempting to decapitate her toy Mickey Mouse.
It’s a phase…
… or a leap, or a growth spurt or fuck knows what but it’s definitely not your kid’s fault.
Claim they are ill
“He’s only wrecking your house because he’s coming down with something. He’ll crash out when we get home.” Hope that no one notices your child looks fit as a fiddle as he rushes around energetically trying to put the cat in the oven.

Either way, the deal is on the table ‘in spirit’ and only requires a little movement on their par. I cannot compromise because the democratic will of the people forbids it, but the EU hasn’t had a referendum so I don’t see why they can’t meet me halfway.
Any negotiation is about give and take. I have given them several of my hard stares, such as Paddington gives in the film Paddington 2.
So a Brexit deal is about to happen. As soon as they give in. Or, alternatively, I could capitulate, agree to the deal we already agreed last December, and pluck up the courage to disagree with 10 DUP MPs  instead of 27 EU countries.
Either way, definitely within 48 hours. Splendid.",NaN,13th November 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake
What does your car say about whether you believe your car is your personality?,"THE car you drive says a lot about you, if you’re one of those people who consider their car to be a core component of their self-image. But are you one of those people? Find out: 
LEXUS IS 250
The Lexus driver has the confidence to spend big, a leaning toward luxury and a willingness to experiment with less traditional marques. If you’re into cars, that is. Otherwise it’s just a big car.
MINI COUNTRYMAN
A witty, innovative take on a classic, three qualities which drivers imagine reflect those same qualities in themselves. To everyone else it’s a extra-large version of a car defined by being small, which is stupid.
AUDI S4
These motorists admire the Germans and their characteristic efficiency right up to the point of claiming that whatever else you might say about him Hitler was a military genius up to at least 1942. Arouses in others a mild dislike which is soon justified.
RANGE ROVER
Size, aggression, off-road ruggedness and being a Premier League footballer but a sensible one, a defender, perhaps Kyle Walker. These are the qualities drivers of Range Rovers are convinced their cars convey. All others wonder why you would need one if you are not a farmer.
KIA PICANTO
To car people this is unforgivably Korean, painfully unoriginal, shamefully reliable and if you were on a low budget, why not go for something vintage?

Is your partner a pain in the arse to sleep with?,"IF you wake up knackered and irritable most mornings it’s possible your partner is an annoying bastard to sleep with. Take our test and find out.
How do they go to sleep?
A) By drifting off quietly like a little mouse on valium.
B) By fucking around with their phone for an hour, reminding you of that really stressful thing you’ve got to do tomorrow, then passing out instantly to begin the night’s snoring.
Do they make sounds while sleeping?
A) No. It’s like sharing a bed with a statue but a bit warmer. 
B) If they’re not heavy-breathing like a rhino with a nasal mucus problem, they’re waking you up with weird dream-talk like “That’s the wrong dildo, Gromit!”.
What is their ‘duvet policy’?
A) They take only their fair share.
B) A bitter struggle for total control of the duvet that would leave the Red Army impressed with their tenacity.
Do they move about?
A) No. They’re like a lovely log.
B) If they’re not constantly wrestling the pillow they’re taking their third trip to the bathroom because who’d have thought drinking all that lager before bed might have an effect?
What is their waking up routine? 
A) They silently slip out of bed like a hungover snake. 
B) After hitting the snooze button for the fifth time they get up to shower, leaving the alarm on to rudely awaken you from the first precious bit of sleep you’ve had all night.

How to blame your parents for f**king you up,"IF your life is a depressing failure, why not blame your mum and dad as Philip Larkin suggested? Here’s how to make them responsible for your personal shortcomings.
They sent you to the wrong school
If your tightarse parents had sent you to private school you would have magically overcome your innate laziness. You could have been a top barrister or something, instead of your current career in fried chicken.
They didn’t teach you how to be popular
If your parents had been witty raconteurs who socialised with fascinating, sparkling people, you would have a heaving social diary rather than spending every evening watching Hollyoaks in a slanket.
They’ve got dodgy genes
Are you a bit of a fatty with a bad haircut and body odour? Technically you can sort out those things yourself, but it’s much easier to blame it on your parents and their bad genetic make-up. Thanks a lot for the beer gut, dad!
They avoided giving you the ‘sex talk’
Your parents never discussed healthy relationships with you, which is definitely the reason you can’t keep a partner, not because you can’t be arsed to brush your teeth and only watch horror films involving lots of torture.
They won’t die so you can buy a house
If your parents have the temerity to still be alive and won’t move to a nasty little bungalow so you can have their money to buy a house, it’s basically child cruelty. Even if you’re 42.",NaN,9th November 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/parents-2.jpg,Fake

42-year-old man wrongly thinks he can still have ‘massive weekends’,"A MAN is desperately clinging to the belief that he enjoys spending the whole weekend binge drinking.
Stephen Malley, who now has hangovers lasting several days, claims he loves a ‘proper bender’ even though he spends the rest of the week quietly weeping in the toilets at work.
Friend Wayne Hayes said: “Steve thinks there’s some manly honour in getting so shitfaced every weekend that he wants to die from the moment he stops drinking on Sunday until he starts again on Friday.

Brexiter watching Britain ‘take back control’ from luxury mansion in France,"A LEADING Brexiter feels the unfolding chaos of Brexit is going well from the vantage point of his massive house in France.
Denys Finch Hatton, head of the ‘Make Britain British Again’ group, is monitoring the progress of Brexit from his estate near La Rochelle where he is living on the advice of his accountant.
Finch Hatton said: “It’s heartening to see the brave citizens of Hartlepool, Swansea and Sunderland stand firm and tell the liberal elite where to stick their jobs.
“It’s vital we have the hardest possible Brexit. Anything else would be a disgusting sell-out. Excuse me, I just have to finish my duck confit and Dauphinoise potatoes.”
Finch Hatton admitted he had agonised for weeks over how to vote in the referendum before realising he would still be very rich whatever happened.

What to say about someone’s new baby if you don’t give a shit,"TELLING someone their beloved newborn looks like a wrinkled ball sack or Iain Duncan Smith tends not to go down too well. Here are some things to say instead.
‘Hasn’t she got tiny fingernails?’
In any other context this question would be considered embarrassingly trite but new parents will be so out of their minds with tiredness it will be received as a great wisdom.
‘He’s a big one, isn’t he?’
What you’re really thinking is ‘Christ, how the hell did you force this massive thing out of your privates, you lunatic?’, but don’t actually say that out loud, even though the mother is probably thinking something similar herself.
‘Things are certainly going to be different when she’s growing up’
This inane statement will make you look thoughtful if your new parent friends are a bit dull. However it may spark a rambling conversation about The Future which will be more interesting than more stuff about bloody baby food.
‘He doesn’t look much like you’
This comment will demonstrate that you have spent a polite amount of time looking at the baby, and also create some potentially entertaining conflict around its paternity.
‘If I drop him, will he bounce?’
Both an interesting theoretical proposition and a sure-fire method of having the baby taken away from you instantly.

How are you pretending it’s OK not to have a pension?,"ARE you secretly shitting yourself about not having a pension but want to pretend it’s fine? Here are some great ways to delude yourself.
There’ll be lots of people in the same boat
Tell yourself there’ll be loads of people without pensions so the government is bound to make sure they’re OK. Ignore the fact that you’re more likely to be put in a ‘granny camp’ surrounded by razor wire making cheap socks for Primark.
You can live off your inheritance
This might be the case if you’re a character in a Dickens novel, but in reality your parents are more likely to sell their home to pay for Saga cruises and things old people shouldn’t have, like MacBooks and Viagra-fuelled swinging parties.
Convince yourself you’re a rebel
Keep telling yourself not having a pension is like being Peter Fonda in Easy Rider. You’re a free spirit and The Man ain’t going to make you pay into a pension. 
You’ll be too old to enjoy yourself anyway
Paint the bleakest possible mental picture of retirement, eg. watching Eggheads again in a grim retirement home while eating mashed banana. Don’t dwell on all the ‘silver foxes’ having a high old time in retirement with their sports cars and wine tasting holidays.
Have an improbable last-minute ‘plan’
You can probably do something that will make you rich just in time for retirement such as writing a best-selling novel. Other unlikely schemes might include inventing a ubiquitous product such as Post-it notes or a jet engine powered by tap water.
Note: This plan may unravel as you find yourself aged 64 still stuck on page three of your dire novel about a giant man-eating squid which is basically Jaws but much, much shitter.
Hope that society collapses
Pray that Brexit obliterates the UK economy or there’s a nuclear war so everyone is equally fucked. As you cook squirrel stew in a filthy dustbin lid at least you didn’t waste money on a boring pension back in ‘the Happy Times’.",NaN,2nd November 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/worried-man-2.jpg,Fake

Running produces endorphins, but so does getting changed into exercise clothes, opening the door and deciding it’s probably going to rain, and lying on the sofa instead.

Social class based on how you feel about Wotsits,"YOUR feelings about Wotsits are the strongest indicator of your true social class, it has been revealed.
After decades of using traditional markers including the number of books in your house, where you went to school, and how many seconds of The Archers you can stand, scientists have found the Wotsit Principle to be the most accurate.

“Working class people will sympathise enthusiastically. Most upper class people, while not being snobby about it,  just won’t have a clue what you’re talking about. Upper class people eat Monster Munch and Frazzles.
“Middle-class people have a different reaction, usually taking the form of a wistful half-smile. This is the result of them remembering that scally mate from school who would have Wotsits in their packed lunch.”

The Mash guide to avoiding a shark attack,"SHARK attacks are a regular occurrence in modern Britain, but what most people don’t know is they’re actually largely avoidable. Here’s how:
Stay out of the sea
Nearly all shark attacks take place in the sea so first and foremost stay away from the sea. Even if it means physically never leaving the house ever again. You’ll thank us when you’re not getting eaten by that shark.
Stay away from the beach 
You might think you can still go the beach but what if a shark somehow managed to get halfway out of the sea, grab you in it’s jaws and then drag you back out into the ocean. To avoid this stay in on the couch and play Xbox instead.
Don’t go to any pubs or bars
Whilst there may not be any sharks actively in the pub or bar, there could be gangsters and you might spill one of their drinks and then they take you off to some massive warehouse they have which has got sharks in a big pool in it and then feed you to them.
Buys lots of tinned food and bottled water and barricade yourself in the house 
The simplest way to avoid being eaten by a shark is to nail two pieces of wood across your front door, buy lots of bottled water (remember ‘a running tap is a shark’s open window’) and buy a few hundred pounds worth of tinned food, meaning you’ll not have to risk leaving the house anytime soon and being devoured by one of Britain’s many Great Whites.",NaN,30th October 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake

Six bullshit fast food hacks we copied off the internet without checking,"DO you desperately want to believe you can outwit fast food restaurants with secret ‘hacks’? Here are some amazing ones that definitely aren’t bollocks.
McDonald’s 
Turn an ordinary hamburger into a Big Mac by asking for special sauce instead of ketchup. Then add two cheese slices, a cold burger you’ve brought from home and a slice of white bread cut into a 5” disc. Hey presto – a bargain ‘Big Mac’ and you only look like a sizeable twat!
KFC
Just order coleslaw and gravy. They’re not expecting this so it confuses their till system which means they have to give you £1,500 in cash and 600 pieces of chicken.
Chicken Cottage
All Chicken Cottage branches have a secret VIP champagne bar if you know the codeword. Simply say the phrase ‘Beaky beaky grease grease’ and you’ll be ushered to an elegant Georgian room where you can eat chicken with your fingers with Tom Hiddleston, Patrick Stewart and the Queen.
Burger King
Get free Whoppers as follows. When your burger arrives, gobble it down BEFORE handing over your money then refuse to pay. The police can’t touch you because there’s no evidence a crime has taken place. (This also works if you want to do a murder.)
Nando’s 
Nando’s chicken is yummy, so simply set up an international peri-peri chicken franchise of your own that uses an identical recipe. If your staff won’t give you free chicken, just sack them.

Coward already has heating on,"A WEAKLING has turned his heating on before it has even hit November, it has emerged.
Tom Logan put the heating on on Thursday morning, like some sort of decadent billionaire lizard that requires a tropical climate to live.
His grandmother Eileen, who has not even started wearing the big cardigan yet, was visiting at the time and said she is deeply embarrassed by the incident.
She said: “I got up to open all the windows in the house, get a nice breeze going, and this little coward’s sat there suspiciously-near the kitchen radiator.
“That thing should be cold as balls until at least mid-December, but he’s pressed up against it like he and the pipes are on the first night of their honeymoon.”
“I don’t want to be a dick about it but his mother raised him wrong.”

May, who was given the job immediately after an enormous load of shit arrived and all other candidates pulled out, saw her request for a new shovel refused and was ordered to get on with it.
A member of the 1922 Committee said: “There is a lot of shit. But she volunteered.

“No, we’re not giving her any help or anywhere to get rid of it. That’s her problem. She’s the shit-shoveller.”

Reintroduction of wolves ‘should start in London’,"PACKS of wolves should be reintroduced to London to curb unmanageable population growth, experts have claimed.

The wolves, who last ran wild in the capital in the eighth century, will be prepared by training them in a dark grey maze and giving them a taste for human flesh.
Naturalist Dr Helen Archer said: “It’s a much more humane way to thin numbers than issuing hunting licences.
“The wolves, which are adult greys and can easily take down a full-grown man who has a latte in one hand and a laptop in the other.
“At first they’ll pick off the weak, the slow, and anyone who tries to livestream them on social media, but as their numbers and confidence grow we’re hoping nobody will be safe.
“Within six months they should have reduced the human population down to a more manageable level, as well as hugely cutting emissions and forcing the cancellation of Made In Chelsea.
“It’s okay, because if nature meant you to survive you’ll be fine.”

"How to shave seconds off your commute by being a rude, pushy dickbag","SO you’re walking through a train station and someone is coming in the opposite direction and headed right for you.
The human thing would be for you both to split difference so you don’t collide. But you’re not human you’re a timelord. You are the master of time. Stay on course. This is a game of chicken and you are going to win.
Now, imagine you’re at the platform and a train has arrived. People are lining up either side of the doors. Ignore politeness and basic physics by standing in front of the doors like a psychopath. Sure, this makes everything slower as you’re in the way of people getting off the train, but this isn’t about being literally quicker, it’s about creating a quicker ‘vibe’.
You’ve stepped onto the train, there’s space to move into, but stay close to the doors so that you can get off quickly at your stop. Don’t move, even if it stops someone else from being able to get on. If you start to feel guilty just tell yourself “Their journey is not my journey”.
Whatever you do, don’t take your rucksack off. And try to use as much space as physically possible, really stretch out. But how will that make you faster? Well it’ll piss everyone off, increasing the stress hormones in their bloodstream and in turn slowing their reactions. And if they’re slower, then what are you?
Faster!

Every toilet in the land used to have a cistern full of smug little books about how to be calm or why being a grammar Nazi is great. Where have they all gone?
Would drinking a bottle of Domestos be fatal?
Before phones and toilet books, the only bathroom entertainment was deciphering the difficult chemical names on the back of cleaning products. Clue: probably, so don’t try it.
Is there a murderer behind the shower curtain?
It’s unlikely, but pursuing this line of thought could turn your bathroom visit into a thrilling and frightening experience similar to an immersive screening of Psycho, rather than a humdrum bodily function.
What is the meaning of life?
A hard hitting question with much to explore, but luckily you’ve only got as long as it takes to do a shit so you probably won’t fall into endless existential despair before it’s over, unless you’re constipated.

Your guide to dealing with the aftermath of a one-night stand,"ONE-NIGHT stands can be tricky. Should you sneak off like a criminal before they wake up or sit down for a full English with their parents? Our handy guide will help.
Remember where you left your clothes
If you decide to sod off without saying goodbye, don’t end up having a 15-minute game of ‘find the pants’. Somehow that’s more embarrassing than shagging a complete stranger who says weird things during sex.
Don’t ask them what their name is
You will probably have forgotten their name the second you necked your seventh Jägerbomb, but they don’t need to know that. Also, calling them ‘mate’ will immediately clear up any confusion that this might be a continuing romance. 
Don’t feign interest in them just to be polite
If you never want to see them again, don’t try to salve your guilt by pretending to admire their vast collection of rubbish action movies or commemorative Harry and Meghan thimbles. Instead say ‘Thanks!’ briskly and leg it.
Look for subtle clues that they just want you to fuck off home
Your temporary sex partner might want you to leave immediately rather than hang around all day eating their crisps and poking around their flat. Be receptive to signals such as them looking incredibly pissed off.
Lie about how amazing it was
Friends will demand to hear the salacious details of your steamy romp. If the sex was crap maintain your dignity by describing a particularly hot porn movie instead. It’s also sexier if you don’t mention you’re now totally paranoid about STDs.

Would your partner rather go out with their phone than you?,"EVERYONE loves their smartphone, but are you concerned your partner would rather have a relationship with it than you? Take our quiz and find out. 
You are watching a film together. Does your partner:
A) Watch the film.
B) Spend the entire time looking at reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, tweeting about it and googling members of the cast they’ve “seen in something else”, then act as if it’s a massive achievement to identify Amy Adams. 
Your partner is in the mood for sex. Do they:
A) Give you a cheeky wink and ask whether you fancy an ‘early night’.
B) Claim they’re exhausted and head upstairs with their phone whispering, “At last we can be alone, my sweet.”
How does your partner spend their evenings?
A) Talking to you about what to watch on Netflix, how your day has been and perhaps joking about whose turn it is to take the bins out.
B) Having long ‘conversations’ with people they don’t know on other people’s Facebook pages and watching YouTube videos of skateboarding animals with an expression of utter devotion on their face.
You go for a meal with your partner. Do they:
A) Listen intently to your opinion on the chicken jalfrezi.
B) Spend the entire evening in a state of agitation because they are desperately trying NOT to check their notifications. When you go to the toilet they furtively update their social media to proudly tell everyone they’re having a phone-free evening.
Your partner gets a promotion. What do they do?
A) Call you straight away to share the news.
B) Post it on Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram, Snapchat their mates about it and set up a WhatsApp group called ‘I GOT A PROMOTION’, then casually tell you about it the next day.
Mostly As: Good news – your partner loves you more than their phone. Discourage them from getting a snazzy new one just in case.
Mostly Bs: You are facing stiff competition from your partner’s phone. Try showing them amusing pictures of cats, listing 16 things you can do with an avocado and making beeping noises to get their attention.

It should include something painfully bourgeois
Normal people get bored of shagging the same person. You should no longer fancy your partner because you’re obsessed with the attractive watercolours tutor Valentina on your two-week creative retreat in Sardinia. 
It should be hideously complicated
“I can’t get it up” or “My husband has become fat and unattractive” are genuine sex problems but not really intellectual enough for the Guardian. Try something more poncy, like: 
“I’ve always envied my sister’s lesbian relationships but with a demanding new job in arts management I don’t have time for sexual experimentation. My husband is straight but had same-sex relationships at university, so am I feeling a justifiable sense of ennui or is it just ‘new job jitters’? Also…” [Continue until readers are utterly confused.]
It should prove how liberal you are
This sort of thing is good: “My wife and I have a great sex life, but recently I realised I’ve never had a gay or transgender experience. Should I get a sex change and start sleeping with men who used to be called Naomi?”
It should be pretentious
You know the score. “I cannot achieve orgasm unless I imagine my colleague Matteusz. He has an appreciation of Paganini my husband, an IT consultant, can never hope to have.” 
It should include a jaw-dropping ‘WTF’ element
The best Guardian sex problems are totally unlike the average person’s sex life. Definitely send in problems such as:
“My boyfriend only enjoys sex if we do it doggystyle with me dressed as Darth Vader while he inserts exotic fruit into his rectum and our mutual friend Hugh watches.

Yet another place that’s too far away legalises weed,"YET another country that is far too distant from Britain to be worth the trip has irritatingly made weed legal.

“The Irish are voting for some radical shit these days. They might do it. Man, that would make me entirely against a hard border.” 
Following Canada, Australia is planning to legalise cannabis within the next three months solely to piss the UK off. ",NaN,17th October 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/joint667.jpg,Fake
Woman with whole life ahead of her going to spend it worrying about what someone just said,"A YOUNG woman whose life is bursting with possibility plans to spend the next sixty years obsessing over minor social interactions.

The older person’s guide to ruining social media,"ARE you old? Do you want to embarrass and annoy younger family members? 
Here’s how to use social media platforms to do just that.
Over-share about your sex life
If you’re retired you’ll have plenty of time for both social media and middle of the day shags. Why not combine the two for the maximum mortification of your relatives?
Misunderstand hashtags
Even if you know that #MeToo is a movement against sexual harassment, pretend you think it’s a trendy digital way to agree with someone’s opinion about who’s going to win Bake Off this year.
Share ‘patriotic’ images with links to far-right groups
If your kids are lefty hipster types they’ll be mortified if you share anything with a Union Jack on, especially if it came from a website about how white people are an endangered species.
Ask incredibly personal questions
Pretend you’ve forgotten that their Facebook wall is on public view and ask them questions like ‘How did it go at the gynaecologists this morning?’
Use emojis inappropriately
Some emojis have curious double meanings, such as the big purple aubergine. Post that multiple times under an Instagram picture of your son’s new girlfriend and enjoy the ensuing weirdness.",NaN,17th October 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/computer667.jpg,Fake
"Daniel Craig unmanly for carrying baby, say fans unaware that Bond made quiche","JAMES Bond fans criticising Daniel Craig for carrying a baby are totally unaware that their hero cooked a quiche in A View To A Kill. 
The fans, who believe that James Bond is actually real and the actor who pretends to be him every four years should behave accordingly, appear to have overlooked the key moment of the 1985 film.
Cinema writer Nathan Muir said: “He doesn’t just eat it. He dons the apron and makes it, then serves it up with a bashful smile.
“It’s implied that he has sex with the girl involved, but it would probably be right-on-style 80s sex with an emphasis on caring foreplay and the importance of contraception.
“You can still get in a gunfight while wearing a baby harness, but you can’t when you’re wearing oven gloves to bring your aubergine-and-feta quiche garnished with black olives to the table.

Five idiotic Irish border solutions Brexiters will love,"ARE you a Brexiter with no grasp on reality? Here are some solutions to the Irish border problem you’ll consider perfectly sensible.
Invade the Republic of Ireland
The Republic of Ireland used to belong to Britain anyway, so the Irish are unlikely to object to the country reverting to the wise and compassionate rule of the British army.  
A quick blitzkrieg will quickly overwhelm the Irish army and Dublin will be renamed ‘Stag-Do-on-Sea’. It is impossible to spot a flaw in this excellent plan. 
No border at all
After years of screeching “We’re full!” it might seem odd to have no border. However Brexiters are mainly concerned with keeping out Eastern Europeans and Muslims, whereas the Irish are okay, like Liam Neeson or Val Doonican.
Herbaceous border
An eight-foot wide border planted with a mix of brightly-coloured hardy perennials and South American grasses too delicate for smugglers to step across or terrorists to bomb without ruining its splendour for everyone.
Trained leprechauns
Leprechauns are small and crafty and thus ideal to sneak onto lorries travelling from Ireland to Britain and inspect their goods. If contraband or migrants are discovered the ‘little people’ will simply impound the vehicle using magic.
Killer robots
Swarms of nanobots will locate economic migrants and turn their brains to mush. Any IRA members smuggling arms will be blown away by Terminator 800s saying things like “Top o’ the mornin’ to ya – ASSHOLE!”.",NaN,16th October 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/rep667.jpg,Fake
Family holiday offers chance to clean up in exotic new kitchen,"PARENTS of two young children have booked a foreign holiday so that they can clean up in an exciting new kitchen.

Tom Booker said: “We don’t see why we should stop travelling just because we’ve gone from being a cultured couple to a four-person whirlwind of faecal matter. It’s been a lifelong dream to visit the Colosseum, or at least to organise a trip there and then cancel it on the day because one of the kids has explosive diarrhoea.”
Clare Booker said: “I can barely imagine the thrill of cleaning dried cereal off a marble kitchen surface in a hot country.
“We’re also excited about watching 15 consecutive episodes of badly-dubbed Peppa Pig.”

The former London mayor and foreign secretary has used his column in the Telegraph to assert that he is the legendary prime minister who led Britain through World War Two and he is ready to lead us once more. 
He continued: “Bald. Cigar. Bulldog face. When you look at me that is what you see, for I am Churchill.

“Now is not the time for questions, such as ‘Has he always been Churchill?’ or ‘Didn’t Churchill die in the 60s?’. Such questions are unhelpful and unpatriotic. 
“No, now is the time for Theresa May to resign and for me, Churchill, to take over and lead Britain to an unlikely but resounding victory.”

Northerner attempts to pay on London bus with correct change,"A NORTHERNER visiting London has caused chaos after attempting to pay a bus driver with exact change. 
Carlisle resident Tom Booker was enjoying a three-day trip to London when he found himself in a dispute with a bus driver over what those round shiny things in his hand were.
Booker said: “I’m no yokel. I know you need the right money on buses these days. And I wasn’t being cheated out of 65p.
“But I couldn’t see that little metal dish you put the money in anywhere, and the driver kept barking ‘contactless’ at me even though I wasn’t even trying to touch him.
“I held out a fiver, assuming the fare had gone up, but that only seemed to aggravate him more. Finally the woman behind me muttered ‘fucksake’, did something that beeped and he waved me on.

The six best sexual positions you’ll only do three of,"BORED of your sex life? Why not read about these wild new sexual positions, suggest to your partner you try them, and then not bother because surely sex is one thing you shouldn’t over-complicate? 
MISSIONARY: The tried-and-true favourite, popular with men and women but has the unfortunate side-effect of slight guilt that you’re not trying something more adventurous like the glamorous people do. So you will, then you’ll go back to this.
COWGIRL: Otherwise known as ‘Her On Top’ or ‘Her Best Chance Of An Actual Orgasm’, this enduring popular position is unfashionable because it’s popular. Kate Moss would probably call you a ‘basic bitch’ for doing it. Can you really risk an imaginary diss from a middle-aged supermodel?
DOGGYSTYLE: The last of the positions you’ll actually bother with, this one’s good but tends to tempt men to slap arse like a jockey on a racehorse. Also you’ll have to put the fitted sheet on again afterwards, and is it worth it when you could do it another way and save yourself the trouble?
REVERSE COWGIRL: Like cowgirl, except instead of facing your partner you’re looking at that mysterious stain on the wall and all that stuff you should tidy up on the drawers instead. Not recommended if the lady has an ill-advised Take That backpiece.
SPOONS: Combines sex and sleep, or to be honest unfavourably compares sex to sleep. If you’ve got kids and/or a demanding job will simply become sleep. And you’d finally got round to having sex.
ONE WHERE SOMEBODY’S GOT A LEG IN THE AIR: After this there are loads of positions, all of which involve one partner having one or more legs in the air. You will tire of having a leg in the air so quickly. Even Stormy Daniels only does leg-in-the-air for 45 seconds.

“I tried to listen but all I could think was ‘That’s not true’ and ‘This guy does not know what the hell he’s talking about’. Then a terrible thought occurred – is that me?

Theresa May’s guide to never answering a single f**king question,"ARE people constantly asking you annoying, awkward questions? Here are my foolproof ways of never giving a straight answer.
Waffle like a bastard 
This is my favourite way of avoiding questions. In everyday life – perhaps in a flatshare scenario – you might use it as follows:
“Dave, did you eat all my fucking cheese?”
“Karen, I think we can both agree cheese is delicious. I absolutely share your commitment to cheese. Let me tell you about some of the cheeses I have eaten. Cheddar, Cheshire, brie, goat’s cheese, grated cheese…” [Continue until other person loses the will to live.]    
Cough as if you’re about to suddenly expire
My extended coughing fit at last year’s Tory conference was actually a cunning ruse to avoid divulging information about my incredibly shit policies. I felt I pulled it off brilliantly.
Slag off Labour instead
I like to avoid valid questions by making irrelevant criticisms of Labour, eg. “Yes, it’s impossible for a young couple to buy a house, but do we want to go back to the Winter of Discontent when you’d come home from work and find a family of rats watching your telly?” 
If faced with a difficult real-life question like “Do you love me?” simply reply: “I think you’ve got to ask, would you prefer to be shagging Jeremy Corbyn? He probably keeps his Lenin cap on and says ‘Well done, comrade’ afterwards.”
Say ‘Let me be clear’
And then be as clear as a drunk mumbling in Sanskrit backwards with a mouth full of dry-roasted peanuts. Never fails to work on BBC journalists.
Dance like a wanker
A last resort but worth trying next time someone asks you a difficult question. Although probably not if the question is: “Have you been drinking tonight, madam?”",NaN,12th October 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/theresa-may-2.jpg,Fake

He said: “Fighting’s like riding a bike. Once you’ve done it once, you’re brilliant at it forever.
“I don’t go to the gym or do self-defence or boxing training like a lot of these muppets you get. I just rerun that fight over and over in my mind. 
“If someone kicked off now I’d be straight in there like I was in 1978. I imagine it would be over something more serious than who’s the best character in Blake’s 7 though.

The Queen looks like she’s chewing a wasp
Although after spending eight decades doing this sort of nonsense you can’t blame Queenie for being a bit jaded and only able to crack a smile when she sees a horse or a massive gin.
Harry and Meghan’s wedding is mentioned
Eugenie’s wedding is creepily identical to Harry and Meghan’s, so comparisons will be made. However, given that Jack Brooksbank is a forgettable tequila ‘ambassador’ and Meghan is a glamorous American from the telly, it’s still going to look a bit Poundland.
Fergie reminds you of your mum when she’s had a few
Red-faced, over-excited and trying to hog all the attention, Fergie is the nation’s most embarrassing mum, even when she’s not sucking some bald bloke’s toes. (Have an extra drink at this point to blot out that mental image.)
Eamonn Holmes mentions the bride’s ‘charity work’
Princess Eugenie doesn’t have any royal duties, so pissing taxpayer’s money up the wall on her wedding has to be justified somehow. 
A B-list celebrity forgets they’re on camera
Take a drink if you spot Robbie Williams, Cindy Crawford or either of the Beckhams picking their nose or yawning. Down it in one if it’s a D-lister there to make up the numbers, eg. Dean Gaffney or Myleene Klass.

"Life coaching basically rent-a-friend, life coaches confirm","LIFE coaching is essentially renting a friend, life coaches have confirmed. 
In a statement, those working within the profession took pains to differentiate themselves from therapists, counsellors and psychologists.
Life coach Nikki Hollis explained: “We’re not weighed down with all that studying and learning and understanding of psychology.
“I became a life coach when I started calling myself one and made a website. I’m fully qualified to listen and nod and sometimes offer herbal tea.”
She added that her many lonely and suggestible clients found her services – which cost £90 an hour – very beneficial. 
Meanwhile, fellow life coach Roy Hobbs runs “radical action” sessions, encouraging people with more money than sense to get off their arses and do things they want to do, much like a friend would. 
He said: “It’s true, I am absolutely like a friend, the best one you’ll ever have.

"Britain to get laid-back, breezy Australian cigarette warnings after Brexit","BRITISH tobacco warnings will be replaced by Australian ‘You probably won’t get cancer, mate, but go easy in case’ warnings in the event of a no-deal Brexit. 
The UK will no longer be allowed to use harsh EU warnings and instead will print chilled Aussie ones, including ‘Not when the little buggers are about, mate’ and ‘Have a tinnie inbetween’.

Most popular stag-do activity is ‘testing limits of friendship’,"THE most popular activity on a stag weekend is to test the limits of a long-term friendship, according to new research.

Professor Henry Brubaker said: “Make sure the weekend involves long distance travel, preferably overseas, and costs more than anyone would reasonably want to pay. Everyone will resent it.
“Airport drinking should be unreasonable and exhausting. This will create a bitter division between those who would rather be at home reading a book and those who think that getting a drunk in an airport is not tawdry and pathetic.
“The relentless alcohol, the ghastly strip clubs and the increasingly emotional hangovers will exacerbate the weird dynamics that already exist within the group. Bullying and intense rivalries will emerge within the first 24 hours.”

B) Even with a phone or book I will still be concerned that people think I’m a pervert or on the run.
Can you lie convincingly?

Wayne Hayes, owner of seven investment properties, enforces a ‘no shoes on carpet’ policy, does not allow toasters  and warns that Blu Tack marks mean the automatic forfeiture of deposits, but is surprisingly lax on the rain coming in.
He said: “My properties are my future, and looking after them is only good sense. Except when it’s not.
“The fact is that we’ve had a quote to fix that roof and it simply isn’t competitive when compared to the longstanding bucket solution we already have, so fixing it doesn’t make sense. You wouldn’t know that because you’re only a tenant.
“I didn’t see you complain during the heatwave when it was providing ventilation. You need to take more responsibility for your own living conditions. Getting it fixed professionally at your own expense would be a step toward that.”

Scientists demand urgent action to stop extinction of pub pool tables,"PUB pool tables are at risk of becoming an endangered species, experts have warned.
New research has revealed that pub pool table numbers have plummeted from over two million in 1981 to a mere 485 today.
Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: “The pool table’s natural habitat, a manky little room at the rear of the pub, is being destroyed by ‘restaurantism’ – the trend where pubs basically become brightly-lit family eateries that serve beer as an afterthought.
“If this continues the pool table could be driven to extinction, or worse still end up being played only in weird American-themed games warehouses where they also do ‘ten-pin bowling’ and ‘nachos’.”
Pub naturalist Susan Traherne owns a breeding pair of pool tables with which she hopes to repopulate the pubs in her local area.

But I decided to completely ignore that, and try to use it to find a serious relationship anyway.”
At first Hollis was pleased with the response, adding: “Pretty much every man that I fancied was a match. It must be destiny. Either that or men just swipe right on every woman they see! Haha!
“I then noticed that almost every man I talked to wasn’t after a serious relationship at all. How could I have possibly known Tinder would be like this, apart from what all my friends said and the hundreds of articles I’d read about it online?”
Hollis changed her profile to say that she was only after a serious relationship and ‘wanted to start a family in the near future’.
“People were just swiping right without reading. I didn’t realise people on a picture-based dating app would be so superficial!”

Someone on Facebook had a glass of wine
A completely rock-solid reason to have a drink. If you become an alcoholic it’s clearly the fault of social media. Or the government. Or whoever invented computers. But definitely not you.
You put wine in the meal you’re cooking so the bottle’s open now
Just neglect to mention you have spaghetti bolognese six times a week so you can add a tiny splash of red wine and drink the rest of the bottle. 
A news story saying alcohol is good for you
Every couple of months a news story claims alcohol is good for you, so get stuck in. Ignore the fact that it usually refers to a small glass of red wine, not the 10 cans of Stella or bottle of gin you’re planning.
You may also see news stories saying alcohol is bad for you, in which case also get pissed to show you won’t be bullied by the nanny state.
You partner is having a drink
This may sound as though you are simply giving in to temptation, but actually you’re helping to cement your relationship. If you got divorced it would be awful, so actually you’re drinking all that Merlot out of love for your kids.
There is half a bottle of wine in the fridge that ‘needs’ drinking
Everyone agrees unfinished wine ‘needs’ to be drunk so it must be true. Undrunk wine will probably become dangerously unstable and explode, or grow deadly bacteria that wipes out mankind. Do the right thing and get pissed.

Walking under a ladder –  not bollocks
Even men who own BMWs don’t walk under ladders. That’s how unlucky ladders are.
Friday the 13th is unlucky – absolute bullshit 
A myth perpetuated by horror film fans who smell of pizza and unwashed pyjamas. It’s a ruse to take the day off work and watch Paranormal Activity again, whilst eating Honey Nut Cornflakes with their hands.

Delegate Norman Steele said: “As a wealthy retiree whose life is a routine of lawn-mowing and petty boundary disputes, the highlight so far has been complaining about breakfast at my hotel because they wouldn’t let me have seven sausages.

Are you throwing good money after bad? You are Modern Apprenticeships, and will always be remembered as one more way in which the Tories fucked everyone over by giving public funds to their mates.
Are you fumbling, desperate and destined to fail horribly? You are either the annual Connecting With Young Voters event or an unnamed Cabinet minister who will resign in shame next month after his actions at the conference are exposed. 
Are you nostalgic, jingoistic, and likely to resemble a cross between Midsomer Murders and the Radio One Roadshow? You are Theresa May’s Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to which attendance will only reach double figures if it is mandatory under threat of imprisonment. 
Are you a conference regular, a proven failure and evidently some kind of incurable addiction? You are Tax Cuts Boosting the Economy and not even your most fervent supporters expect you to succeed.

Tom Booker said: “We met when we were both in a corridor confused, I was like ‘Is Room 4B this way?’ and he replied ‘I’m looking for 4B too.’ At the time it seemed like such a crazy coincidence that we were both looking for Room 4B, and a reasonable basis for an incredibly close friendship that transcends even brotherhood.

The best musical instruments to be a wanker with,"DO you enjoy playing your music to people but never notice how hideously uncomfortable they look? Here are the best instruments for being a musical wanker.
Guitar
If you’re a woman there’s a strong chance at least one date has ended with a man inviting you back to his house to play their insipid songs for a tediously long time. They may as well just toss off in front of you. Wanker rating: 7
Keyboard
If you expect people to listen to you dick around with a little Casio keyboard with a bossa nova beat – well done, you have reached new levels of self-absorption. However the true music bore needs a big cumbersome keyboard that brings back unpleasant memories of Level 42.
Quite simply it’s the only instrument for musos who want to show off their 18-minute jazz-trance-ambient compositions with titles like Infinities of the Aural Soundscape. Wanker rating: 8
Saxophone
Chances are you’re learning the sax purely because it’s cool, although in your hands it sounds more like painful flatulence. Before you fart out various tracks from your Late Night Sax compilation you should really ask anyone present to sign a consent form. Wanker rating: 6
Ukulele
The instrument of choice for people who also list vintage teacups and Wes Anderson films amongst their interests. Usually used for playing something twee and irritating from the soundtrack of Juno.
You may also be in a hipster ukulele band still doing ‘hilarious’ covers of Smells Like Teen Spirit and Purple Haze six years after everyone lost interest. Wanker rating: 9
Bongos
If you think people genuinely enjoy listening to you play the bongos you are worryingly delusional. If you play them to embellish a poem you wrote then prison is too good for you.

Blazing rows to be judged by VAR,"COUPLES’ arguments will be adjudicated by video assistant referees to determine who is in the wrong.
With the Champions League planning to introduce VAR technology, experts now want high-definition video footage to become a routine part of relationship counselling.
Therapist Tom Logan said: “The problem we face is not knowing which side to take, because it’s one person’s word against the other and they’re usually both bloody liars.
“With VAR technology we can easily establish whether Iain had been criticising a perfectly nice meal, or if indeed it was Gemma who’d had a bad attitude all evening. 
“Then we can really get to the meat of the issue, such as if he did subtly imply that he fancies her mate Vicky. 
“And with cameras installed throughout homes for weeks, months or years, we’ll definitely be able to clear up whose turn it is to put the bins out.”
Emma Bradford, who participated in a trial of the technology with her boyfriend Matt, agreed it was highly effective, particularly when it proved Matt was an idiot.

The bellend’s guide to ruining conversations,"ARE you the sort of twat who likes to hijack conversations or stop other people joining in? Here are some tips for ruining any pleasant chat.
Exclude people
Find a subject half of your friends are unable to contribute to, such as classical music or finding a good primary school in your area. Savour their glumness as they realise they’d have more fun sitting at home listening to Radio 4.
Bring everyone down 
If everyone’s having a light, frothy conversation about weird kids they knew at school or Bagpuss, now is the time, apropos of nothing, to bring up your aunt’s recent cancer scare.
Watch with satisfaction as everyone is forced to talk about your serious thing instead. Other good topics include: the time you were burgled; dead pets; how you wish you could do more to help the victims of genocide.
Talk about something balls-achingly dull 
Steer the conversation onto subjects from the deepest pits of boredom hell: going on an advanced spreadsheets course, or how your new squeegee mop has been a bitter disappointment compared to the last one.
Get everyone using their phones 
Start showing people pictures on your phone. You’ll start a phone ‘chain reaction’ and soon everyone will be looking at utterly pointless photos, such as the carvery meal Gavin and Sue had last April in Ipswich. 
Encourage others to be morons
If any of your friends are having a vaguely intelligent discussion about the economy, derail it with moronic comments like: “Even economists don’t understand it – and they’re all bloody liars anyway!” 
Any dunces present will love your populist stance, and soon you’ll be able to drag the conversation back to droning on about your new cooker or whatever.",NaN,28th September 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/pub-conversation-2.jpg,Fake

“By the time we got to the pub he actually looked quite scared. I should know, because I was wondering if there was some way to just run off.”
Bishop said: “We had a really painful conversation about rugby which neither of us are into. The awkward silences were getting so excruciating I thought I was going to have a panic attack.
“There was no need to take our relationship to the pub. It worked perfectly in the confines of Wanstead Insurance Services and now it’s ruined forever.
“I don’t know how I’ll face Tom tomorrow. We’re both straight but it’s like we had really bad sex.”

UK can’t understand why May announcing vote-winning plan to slash corporation tax quietly in New York,"BRITAIN cannot see why Theresa May is announcing plans to slash corporation tax, sure to be acclaimed by ordinary voters, discreetly in New York.

“But instead of announcing this hugely popular common sense policy in the UK, perhaps to kickstart an election campaign, May seems to be doing it almost as though she’s trying to keep it quiet. 
“I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s privately proposing more hit policies, like contracting US healthcare providers to run the NHS or abolishing all employment rights, to billionaires without realising they’re what we all want to hear.

“And when I go on about how much better Queens of the Stone Age are than anything around today, there’s still a nagging sense of perspective. I don’t have the rock-solid certainty you see in comments on YouTube.
“It’d be nice to never have to bother again, because I keep doing things like listening to the new Arctic Monkeys, so it’s doing me harm.
“It definitely needs to be over before I have kids. A father can’t be open-minded about music. What would they despise?”
Muir also asked at what age he would begin to believe a suit jacket and jeans was a stylish sartorial choice ideal for flirting with younger women, because he is basically ready now.",NaN,24th September 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bored-man-headphones-667x375.jpg,Fake
Parents prepare toddler for life by buying him a little toy cubicle,"A COUPLE are preparing their toddler for adulthood by buying him a tiny grey cubicle to sit in all day, it has emerged.

Sarah said: “My friend’s youngest Isabella loves playing in her little kitchen and looking after her crying doll, so she’s going to be well-prepared for the drudgery that awaits.
“But it was only when Jamie was playing at driving in his Little Tykes Cozy Coupe and wasn’t stuck in traffic beating his head on the dash in frustration we realised he hadn’t learned what he’d be driving to.
“So we’ve got him the cubicle and we’re teaching him to do basic admin in a soul-destroying fluorescent-lit workspace.
“Each day we have different games, like arse-covering, internet skiving, claiming important emails went into his junk folder and, most importantly, clockwatching.

Woman discovers #metoo not for just general agreement,"A WOMAN has discovered that the Twitter hashtag ‘#metoo’ is not meant for just generally agreeing with things.
Nikki Hollis, 27, first saw the hashtag being used in October last year, but failed to realise its significance, and just thought it was a good way to support other Twitter users.
Hollis has used the hashtag to agree with a wide variety of tweets including statements about cheese on toast and cute little dogs.
Hollis finally realised her faux pas when replying to a nostalgic tweet about Thundercats. Hollis wrote: “I always imagined there was something going on between Lion-O and Cheetara #metoo”.
She said: “I was then contacted by a blog that was interested in my feminist reading of Lion-O’s toxic masculinity, and would I be interested in writing an article”
After a protracted and bewildering exchange of messages, Hollis’ confusion was finally cleared up.

Father-of-three Julian Cook said: “You don’t see him at sports day. You don’t see him at the Christmas Fayre. You don’t see him at recorder concerts or any of the other dull shit. I wish I was him.
“He boasts he’s never changed a nappy. For me, that’s not just a routine but a key part of bonding with my son. Though it stinks and you get shit under your nails and I hate it.”

24-year-old Tom Booker has been provoking fight-or-flight reactions in every canine he gets within sniffing distance of since he was a child, and is starting to take it personally.
He said: “You can only laugh it off for so long before it starts getting to you.

"It’s not ‘treating yourself’ if you do it all the time, say experts","CONSTANTLY treating yourself is not actually treating yourself, it is just what you do, scientists have confirmed.
Research by the Institute for Studies found that most Britons were confused by the concept of ‘treats’, with some treating themselves eight times a day or more.
Professor Henry Brubaker explained: “A takeaway once a week is a treat. A takeaway 14 times a week isn’t a treat, it’s being a fat bastard.
“Drinkers were the most confused, saying things like ‘I think I’ll treat myself to a glass of wine’. Frequently this would be followed by at least two more similar ‘treats’.
“Most treats were not a reward for anything. One woman constantly ‘treated’ herself to new tops for no particular reason, which means she was rewarding herself for merely existing.”
Study participant Eleanor Shaw gave a distressing account of how excessively treating herself caused her to lose her ability to enjoy cupcakes.
She said: “I’d treat myself to cupcakes at work for doing something demanding like turning my computer on. Once you add in all the other treats like new earrings I was on about 90 treats a week.
“Now cupcakes do nothing for me and if I want to treat myself I have to get an extra-large doner kebab, which is difficult to eat when you’re on the phone.”",NaN,21st September 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/cupcake-2.jpg,Fake
Couple admit they want ‘no kids’ wedding because they’ll f***ing ruin it,"A COUPLE have decided to be brutally honest about not wanting a load of little bastards at their wedding. 
Nikki Hollis and Tom Booker had originally planned to word the invitation in a devious way so that ‘no children’ sounded like a lovely break from the responsibilities of parenting.
Hollis said: “On reflection this was a transparent lie, so we decided not to insult our friends’ intelligence as well as telling them not to bring their shrieking, snivelling spawn.
“We were going to imply it was a chance for all us old friends to chill out, but we thought, no, we just don’t want kids running round the reception until they injure themselves like the little twats they are.”

B) I’ve got this thing called ‘real life’ going on that tends to overshadow the precise time-bending abilities of Dr Strange.

Man comes out amazingly well from own anecdote once again,"A 28-YEAR-OLD man has emerged as the wry, ballsy hero of his own story yet again.
Administrator Tom Logan told colleagues about an altercation with a motorcyclist in which he came close to punching the man but, as ever, had the self-control not to.
Co-worker Emma Bradford said: “It’s amazing, really. He comes out of these situations cool as a cucumber. I’d be a nervous wreck but I suppose Tom’s used to it because it happens practically every day.
“He was really brave to stand up to that burly motorcyclist. Then saying ‘Don’t come out without your stabilisers next time, mate’ is a brilliant quip to think up on the spot.
“Tom’s wasted as a low-ranking member of the civil service who lives with his parents. He should be in the SAS or something. Actually James Bond would be more like it.”
Logan’s anecdotes regularly combine the skills of a hostage negotiator, stand-up comedian and martial arts expert, but sadly have not yet been witnessed by anyone he knows.

Claim poor people all have loads of pets 
They did on that clearly trustworthy Channel 5 documentary, Skint and Skiving. Is it really too much to ask that they grill a couple of hamsters for a cheap and nutritious meal? 
Do a bizarre calculation about food costs 
Speaking of food, no poor person ever cooks cheaply. However you’ve worked out a 25kg sack of oats would feed a family of four for seven weeks for £20 if they only ate porridge made with water instead of milk. They could fry up congealed bits for variety.
Say they should have done better at school
Let’s face it, poor people are the type who mucked about at school. Or just weren’t very academic. Whatever. Luckily they now know the value of education, which will prevent them being poor once boffins find a way to reverse time and make them 11 again.
Ask why they have mobile phones
As everyone knows, all mobiles cost the same as a top-of-the-range iPhone and are purely a frivolous luxury item like a life-size clockwork peacock.
Make stuff up

John Lewis starting to suspect it is being undersold,"JOHN Lewis is beginning to wonder if its prices may be much, much higher than its rivals after years of wilful ignorance.
The department store is in crisis as customers appear to be buying the same products elsewhere for less money, leaving bosses baffled.
A spokesman said: “We’re the cheapest. Right? You’d tell us if we weren’t, wouldn’t you?
“Because I know this is hard to believe, but it seems that some people think of us not as a bargain-basement outlet but as ‘one of those expensive shops’.
“For years we’ve never knowingly been undersold, but it turns out that was largely because we’ve religiously avoided finding out what they charge for toasters at Argos.
“In retrospect perhaps it was a mistake to, whenever anyone discussed pricing at other shops, put our hands over our ears and sing ‘lalala’ as loud as we could.”
Loyal customer Susan Traherne said: “£30 may seem like a lot for a pair of salad tongs, but they’re lovingly gift-wrapped by a woman called Mel who asks me gently about my holiday plans.

Even pub not sure why it’s playing music everyone bloody hates,"A PUB has made the strange decision to play extremely crap music at a deafening volume despite it being loathed by everyone including the staff.
Every night without fail, bar staff at the Green Man in Nuneaton put on mixes of mediocre house or bad 80s compilations featuring Level 42 which they would never listen to at home.
Meanwhile customers complain bitterly as they struggle to make themselves heard above the nondescript racket, but equally mysteriously come back every night.
Landlord Tom Logan said: “It’d be unthinkable not to crank up the music to nightclub levels at 6.30, even though it would be incredibly strange if someone ever got up and danced to it. 
“No one ever complains so it must be pleasing somebody, though I’m not sure who. Not me. I fucking hate it. Right, time to put on Megabeatz Euro House, Volume 17.

What sort of car twat are you?,"WITH so many makes and models there are lots of ways to be a car-owning twat. But what sort of vehicular twattery is right for you? Read our guide.
Thrifty twat 
You have a decent income but hate spending money so you drive a 90s Golf or ancient Volvo that leaves a plume of black smoke like a squid under attack. You’re such a tightarse you’ll endure endless breakdowns until it completely falls apart like a clown car. 
Show-off twat
You love people staring at your Porsche Spyder or Aston Martin. Sadly the kudos quickly wears off whenever you get out and everyone realises you’re a portly middle-aged businessman in ironed jeans who’s been rocking out to Chris Rea. 
Wide boy twat 
You drive a Beemer or Merc. You like to imagine you look like a successful drug dealer. You are not. You work in a shop and are skint as usual so you’re driving over for dinner at your mum’s yet again.
Illegal twat 
You lurch around the streets in an uninsured 1980s Ford Escort with no MOT or hubcaps. Other drivers dread an accident with you, but to be honest a minor bump will probably reduce your ride to a pile of rust flakes and an old Shakin’ Stevens cassette.
Boy racer twat 
You’ve modified your Citroen Saxo or Honda Civic so much it’s technically a different car. Your proudest achievement is dicking around with the exhaust so other road users think they’re being overtaken by Apollo 7. 
Anal retentive twat 
Your Qashqai or Skoda gives you a sexual thrill when you think about the resale value and excellent miles-per-gallon. You love to talk at length about fools who spent more on an Audi with the same boot space.

Teenager’s accent changes dramatically when parents leave the house,"THE neighbours of a well-spoken teenager have noticed his accent radically alters when his parents are not around. 
17-year-old Tom Logan’s speech transforms from middle-class ‘nice boy’ into hardened South London ‘roadman’ the minute his parents go to their well-paid jobs or Waitrose.
Neighbour Julian Cook said: “Today I heard Tom say, ‘Bye mum. I’ll finish off the leftover quinoa and feta salad if that’s okay with you.’
“But when one his mates came over a bit later I distinctly heard him saying things like, ‘Shut up fam, she’s proper peng ting.’ 
“I thought perhaps his parents had hired a Chinese tutor, but when I heard him describe our stockbroker suburb as his ‘endz’ I realised it was just middle-class teenager identity bollocks.”

Everything you need to be a bellend at university,"IT’S traditional to be a bellend during your time at university, so what will you need? Forget the family-sized bag of pasta and cheese grater, here are the real essentials to take with you.
Lame ‘hard’ anecdotes 
Freshers often compete to have the most pre-uni ‘street cred’, so be ready to mention any drug experiences or ultra-minor run-ins with the police. Don’t try too hard – being put in detention will make you look like NWA.
Weird clothes 
If you’re going down this road you can try anything from the classic ‘unconvincing vampire’ Goth look to a random jumble of ‘alternative’ clothes such as corduroy dungarees and a Rasta hat. This will definitely never come back to haunt you in the age of camera phones and Facebook.
Conversations about A-levels
If there’s one thing you’ll talk about a lot at uni, it’s A-levels. Have lots of scintillating A-level chat ready, such as: what A-levels you did; what grades you got; the person who wet themselves during the English Lit exam. (Neglect to mention that was you.)
Dance moves
Learn these approved student dance steps:
● A single moderately competent move, eg. the running man, but which you repeat endlessly all night as if mentally unwell.
● Robotically moving your arms up and down and occasionally jerking left and right like the Duracell Bunny. Pretty cool move if you hang out with science students.
● Just jumping about frantically. It’s punk. Or something.
The ability to bullshit
Crucial in every sphere of university life. Have you done the pre-reading? Yes. Do you like listening to a stranger drone on about his arse-end-of-nowhere hometown? Sure! Are you only at this tedious SU meeting because you haven’t made any friends? No way!
Selective amnesia
You’re definitely going to make a total tit of yourself many, many times, whether it’s shitting yourself during an alcohol blackout or mispronouncing ‘hyperbole’ in a seminar. 
Practise blotting out unwanted memories. This will also come in useful whenever you remember how much getting a degree from a university nobody has heard of is costing you.",NaN,13th September 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/students-university-2.jpg,Fake

How are you pretending not to be pissed at work?,"YOU popped into the pub at lunchtime ‘for one’ and now you’re feeling surprisingly shitfaced. So how can you conceal it from your colleagues? Read our guide.
Dick about on the internet
Non-work internet surfing is probably frowned upon, but you’re a million times safer doing that than communicating with clients. Just don’t forget where you are in your stupor and send your boss a ‘hilarious’ clip of a monkey trying to shag a zebra.
Tidy up the stationery cupboard
The perfect place to hide until you sober up. You could even have a little lie down. Place some Post-its by your hand so you can claim you were “just picking them up” if someone comes in.
For fuck’s sake don’t answer the phone
But how? Simple. Suddenly realise the phone you breathe all over every day is probably more hygienically hazardous than a medical waste facility. Point this out to colleagues and unplug it from the wall until facilities management come to clean it.
Offer to give a urine sample
If anyone says they think you’ve been drinking, get a mug from the kitchen and offer to piss in it. They will immediately leave you alone.
Pretend to be ill
If you drank enough to feel queasy, vomit in your bin and claim it’s food poisoning. You’ll be sent home immediately, maybe even with some nice sympathy. Just don’t do it every Friday or people might get suspicious.",NaN,7th September 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/happy-office-woman-2.jpg,Fake
Kids vote shoe shopping best time to be proper little bastards,"SHOPPING for shoes is the best time to be a complete and utter dick, children have decided.
Despite stiff competition from car journeys and trips to the supermarket, the UK’s small children believe shoe shops provide the most satisfying ‘kicking off’ experience.
Mum-of-two Emma Bradford said: “I don’t know if it’s something in the chemicals they use to treat leather but as soon as we step into a shoe shop my kids turn on me.
‘My six-year-old threw a size 9 Start-Rite at my head just because I asked the shop assistant about growing room. Then my four-year-old disappeared somewhere with a pair of crocs and I’m pretty sure he ate an odour eater.  
“Not to mention the fact that we always go back three times because shoes that fit perfectly in the fucking shop suddenly feel ‘too tight’ once we get home.” 
Child Martin Bishop said: “At the shoe shop I demanded totally unsuitable shoes then screamed until the shop assistant became genuinely worried.

Your no-deal Brexit emergency survival guide,"THE government has set up ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ to make emergency plans for a chaotic no-deal Brexit. So what should you do if everything goes to shit? Read our survival guide.
Stay in your home
This will actually cause society to collapse more quickly but if it means a few days off work, sod it. Also dads will enjoy doing things like checking the batteries in torches in a manly way.
Assemble a survival kit
Include matches, a camping stove and a multi-purpose tool. Actually let’s be honest, what you’re really going to need are shedloads of bog paper and tampons. Funny how they never mention those in post-apocalyptic Hollywood movies. 
Listen to the radio for official broadcasts 
The government will give you regular updates on the situation and instructions on what to do next. Or there might just be a recorded message saying everything’s fine and some ‘on hold’ muzak. You be the judge of that one.
Stockpile food
If you haven’t already done this go to Asda and grab whatever’s left after the panic buying. There’ll probably only be things like manky carrots and tinned turkey, so get a Jack Monroe book about cooking tasty meals on the dole.
Prepare for law and order to break down
Society is never far from anarchy, according to every apocalyptic drama ever. Before you know it your neighbour could be turning your dog into drumsticks and looking at your kids while holding the BBQ sauce ominously. Therefore it is a good idea to…
Arm yourself
Due to the UK’s sensible firearms laws you won’t be able to get any big sexy guns so you’ll have to improvise. Make a ‘deadly’ mace by hammering six-inch nails through the tennis ball on an old Swingball set.
Buy several ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ mugs

‘Miracle’ mum learns to stick to relevant points of story,"A MUM has baffled scientists by learning to tell a story in a clear and concise way.
Donna Sheridan, 52, used to recount anecdotes in a long and confusing fashion, including people and places that had nothing to do with her eventual point, if there was one.
However after extensive coaching in a laboratory setting, Sheridan has learned to cut out tedious, unnecessary detail such as what the weather was like that day.
Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: “We’re stunned by her new ability to convey information quickly and succinctly without digressing into the plot of Emmerdale.
“We repeatedly exposed her to examples of economical storytelling such as the film Jaws and gradually she learned to cut out irrelevant guff like whether she is planning pasta for dinner.
“We’d assumed mum anecdotes were an evolutionary trait whereby Stone Age mums protected their families from sabre-toothed tigers by keeping them in the cave listening to long, unfocused stories.
“But now this breakthrough offers hope to millions of children who suffer painful mum stories every weekend, often about rhododendrons.”
Sheridan said: “I bumped into my daughter’s old English teacher on Tuesday. Nothing of interest emerged. The end.”",NaN,6th September 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/mum-on-phone-older-woman-2.jpg,Fake
Man so excellent at driving he can set his own speed limits,"A DRIVER is so brilliant at controlling a car he knows exactly how fast he can go without crashing or mowing people down.
Without even needing any specialist training, 29-year-old Tom Booker has used the power of self-belief to master the art of driving at twice the speed limit.
Booker said: “I’ve cut it fine a few times but that’s the only way you achieve excellence – not playing it by the Highway Code.
“Sure, other people – shall we say ladies? – should stick to the speed limit. But a natural driver like me knows instinctively when to overtake on a blind corner.
“Superb driving is a state of mind. That and pushing the pedal down quite far. And sometimes pushing the other pedal quite quickly when you realise an oncoming lorry is about to turn you into jam.”
Booker now feels his superlative driving skills have qualified him to rewrite other areas of the Highway Code, such as overtaking on the inside and parking in disabled spaces.
He added: “The same goes for drink driving. If you can’t handle a vehicle after four pints you shouldn’t really be driving in the first place.”",NaN,6th September 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/male-driver-2-1.jpg,Fake

Why it’s fine for me to buy a house next door to a pub and then try to get it shut down,"By Joseph Turner
I WANTED to move somewhere that has a thriving local community, but only until 10pm when I go to bed with some Horlicks and a John Grisham book.
As a lifelong member of CAMRA I am appalled by the amount of pubs closing down in the UK, but not appalled enough to stop being a belligerent arse about people being rowdy when they leave the pub next door at midnight.
You might ask why I bought a house next to a pub when I want to go to bed early, and the answer is because when the pub is shut it looks like a bucolic scene from Last of the Summer Wine.
The illusion is sadly ruined when people stumble out of the pub singing and shouting, some of them clearly drunk. If they would just shut up and stop spoiling the peace then I could get on with living in an old-fashioned version of England where everyone wears chinos and goes to church.
Don’t get me wrong – I’m all for community, as long as it doesn’t inconvenience me in any way whatsoever. But it’s win-win for me because if the pub does shut I can moan about that too.",NaN,5th September 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/pub667-1.jpg,Fake
Is it really so ridiculous to suggest Corbyn is literally Hitler?,"By Daily Telegraph columnist Denys Finch Hatton
THERE are many photographs of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. There are also many photographs of Jeremy Corbyn. But we never see them in the same room together. Why is this?
I put it to you that Hitler and Corbyn are the same person. They are both socialists. They are both fanatical anti-Semites with a fondness for hats. Perhaps most damning of all, they are both vegetarians. 
Hitler escaped the advancing Soviets in 1945 in a flying saucer and hid in a secret arctic base where he plotted to regain power taking over the Labour Party in 2015. 
But, you might say, wouldn’t Hitler be 129 years old and therefore dead? No. The Nazis were known for their experimental technology such as the robot suit worn by Hitler in the meticulously researched computer game Wolfenstein 3D.
My belief is that Hitler’s head was grafted onto a robot body, and thus ‘Jeremy Corbyn’ was born, ready to slake his insatiable thirst for power by becoming MP for Islington North.
As if further evidence were needed, just watch Herr Corbyn at a Momentum rally. The resemblance to the Fuhrer addressing the Hitler Youth is so obvious it barely needs pointing out.
By now you are probably asking, is it time to destroy robot Hitler-Corbyn with a surgical RAF strike? 
Yes. And if we’re going to spend the money on pilots and plane fuel we probably should bomb Stonehenge while we’re at it, to annoy the powerful Pagan lobby and also deter foreign tourists.

‘Doing the horizontal Theresa May dance’

‘Plugging in your laptop’
Contemporary version of grim, outdated euphemisms like ‘poking the fire’. See also: ‘Emptying your spam’ and ‘Having a good hard software update’.

Trains are a common sexual metaphor, but even in a fit of passion many people are unable to forget the increasingly shoddy service offered by many of Britain’s rail operators.

F**king weirdo has genuine passion for telemarketing,"A MAN who everyone assumed was lying about his “passion for telemarketing” has a genuine love of the shitty, time-wasting career. 
Martin Bishop’s bosses at Telelink Solutions assumed he was just saying the right things in the interview for the cold-calling job, but now fear he may be evil.
Bishop said: “I love everything about telemarketing – the little headset, the soulless office, annoying hundreds of people a day with my ‘Have you had an accident recently?’ bullshit.
“I particularly enjoy being persistent when they’re clearly not interested. For me every second of their time I waste is a glorious victory.
“The best calls are when you make a confused elderly person all agitated and frightened. If one of their children is visiting and tells me to fuck off I just think ‘Job well done!’.
“Am I a bit strange? I don’t think so. I’ve got lots of perfectly normal hobbies like cutting the wings off bees and burning them to death with lighter fluid.” 
Bishop’s boss Mary Fisher said: “I assumed Martin’s ‘passion for telemarketing’ was a lie but it’s not. He’s actually described it as ‘better than sex’ so now I try to avoid touching anything on his desk.

Which patronising local greeting are you using?,"ARE you fond of ‘authentic’ regional greetings that make you sound like a character from Coronation Street? Here’s a complete list from around the UK.
Duck
It’s unclear why the people of the Potteries refer to each other as waterfowl. Some linguists believe it is a version of ‘Duke’ but an alternative explanation is that Stokies simply have webbed feet. 
Lover
Implying you are someone’s lover when you aren’t is already quite stalkerish, but saying it in a West Country accent makes you sound like Fred West.
Chuck
Supremely irritating chirpy Northernism. Favoured by people who desperately want you to know they’re from the North and come across like Victoria Wood crossed with Brian Clough even though they are a fucking university lecturer.
Guillemot
Plymouth slang derived from Plymouthians deep – some would say too deep – love of the popular local seabird. 
Bastardo!
Norwich slang for ‘my dear good friend’. So widely used that locals will be deeply offended if you do not say things like: “Pint of Stella and a medium chardonnay, bastardo!”
Star Lord
Ubiquitous throughout North Wales, ‘Star Lord’ denotes friendliness or gratitude, as in the following exchange: “D’you want your fringe a bit shorter?”, “No, that’s just right, Star Lord.”
Massive shiteball
Originating in the west of Scotland, this greeting is used in all situations to show deep affection, eg. “Happy birthday, Nana, ya massive shiteball.”",NaN,28th August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/wave667.jpg,Fake
Corbyn under pressure to remove head from arse,"JEREMY Corbyn is under increasing pressure to remove his head from his rectum and do something about Brexit.
Campaigners for a second referendum fear the Labour leader may not be fully aware of the risks facing the UK from within the enclosed space of his own anal cavity.
Remainer Donna Sheridan said: “You can’t follow complex issues like the Irish border and leaving the customs union with your head inside your anus. 
“Sure, your own arse is a safe, comforting place to be, but how are you meant to judge the public mood? Unless he’s got a TV up there too, which would be incredibly painful.”
However Momentum member Tom Logan said: “Jeremy’s insertion of his head into his own bunghole just shows how incredibly self-sacrificing and principled he is. He’s a man of his own anus.”

Breakfast in bed just a massive pain in the arse,"HAVING breakfast in bed is not actually enjoyable and just involves lots of discomfort and mess, it has been confirmed.
The Institute for Studies found that a successful breakfast in bed is merely a popular myth with no more basis in reality than fairies, vampires or Atlantis.
Professor Henry Brubaker said: “First there’s the hassle of cooking it. By the time you’ve prepared all the stuff like sausages and toast you’re wide awake and may as well just get up.
“Then there’s the problem of eating while propped up awkwardly in bed. Any enjoyment of the food is completely negated by the stress of trying not to drip egg yolk everywhere. 
“Of most concern are the baked beans, which will escape from your plate with more determination than the inmates of Colditz.
“My advice is to either go back to sleep or get up and have a civilised meal using a popular food consumption device known as a ‘table’.”

Five ways to say ‘I told you so’ while being a passive-aggressive dick about it,"NOBODY likes to hear ‘I told you so’, but everyone loves finding a way to say it. Here’s five particularly dickish ways to say ‘I told you so’ without using the actual words:
‘I thought this might happen’
The perfect way to let everyone know that you saw a disaster coming, could have averted it, didn’t and now expect recognition of your prescient wisdom.
‘I’m not going to say it’
Conveys that you are thinking the words ‘I told you so’ and even putting them in others’ minds, but just stops short of actually saying it. Which is even worse.
‘It’s a lesson for next time’
And that lesson is ‘Next time listen to me, you useless twat. I’m not eye-rolling for nothing over here’.
‘If only someone had said something’
Somebody did say something. You did. But this way you get to look gracious enough not to take credit while still patting yourself on the back.
Heavy sigh
Pure judgement – no words needed. The message will be clearly received and if it’s not, you’ve always got more sighs in the sigh-bank.

The middle class person’s guide to working class people,"ARE you middle class and unsure how to interact with working class people? Don’t worry, here is a guide to their strange – and often frightening – ways.
What do working class people like? 
Mostly a form of interactive theatre known as ‘football’. Unlike Chekhov or Mamet it allows you to join in by shouting “WANKER!” or, if you are particularly passionate about the unfolding drama, hurling a £1 coin.
What language do working class people speak?
It may sound like a foreign language, but listen closely and you’ll realise it is a version of correct English but with odd grammatical constructions like “You what?”.
Much like the French they appreciate it if you attempt to master their tongue. The next time you meet a builder say: “Alright mate? See the fucking Villa play the fucking Tottenham? Gor blimey, I’d like a pint and some tits.”
Are working class people dangerous?
Yes and no. A certain type of ‘hard’ working class bloke is what is known as a ‘bullshitter’ and will shut the fuck up instantly if anyone says, “No, I don’t agree with that I’m afraid.”
However others are very physically strong due to carrying heavy things like spanners all day, so think twice before asking if their tattoo is ironic.
Where do working class people live?
Traditionally, in a pokey council house with a whippet, mother-in-law and parrot. However due to getting a job and not poncing around expensively at university many of them now have better houses than you, albeit with more shit solar lights of fairies.
Should I have sex with a working class person?
Biologically you are compatible and may even produce offspring. However bear in mind Lady Chatterley’s Lover is a fanciful novel and not a scientific paper on working class virility, so some of them may be disappointing in bed.
Am I actually working class myself?
No. If you are middle class you are not working class “because you go to work”. That does not make you working class, it makes you a twat.",NaN,24th August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bin-man-2.jpg,Fake

Rail staff subsequently decided it would be unsafe for the train to continue on its two-hour journey with dangerous levels of irritation on board.

“That and them doing strange poses in the aisle which looked as if they were rehearsing, but were actually just them showing off.”

Any chance of a film that isn’t for kids or idiots? ask filmgoers,"ADULT filmgoers have been wondering if there is any chance studios could produce something that is not the cinematic equivalent of Haribos.
After a glut of superhero franchises, reworkings of children’s books and inane sci-fi, audiences would be intrigued to see a film with some connection to reality.
Regular cinemagoer Norman Steele said: “Just for once I’d like to see a film that isn’t about cartoon CGI wasps that bizarrely tries to tug at your heartstrings.
“It would also be awesome to not see a film in which various superheroes endlessly pummel each other in extreme ways that would surely reduce their insides to mush.
“Believe it or not, there’s a vast audience for films that don’t appeal to your inner nine-year-old but instead your outer 42-year-old who can cope with things that are real. 
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m not looking for critically acclaimed four-hour cult masterpieces of North African cinema in which a boy spends the entire film looking for his lost goat, then dies.
“I’d just like to see a film that’s resolved by things that are actually possible, not characters reversing time with the Cube of Krondos, or some other bullshit that’s basically magic.” 
Steele then went to his local multiplex and saw a film in which the heroine dangled from a blown-up building 200 feet above a massive inferno, only to be rescued by someone with a long, stretchy arm.

What do the new GCSE grades really mean?,"GCSE grades used to be letters but are now numbers, because politicians like to fuck around and change stuff to feel important. But what do the new grades actually mean? 
1: The lowest grade without actually failing. If you got this you’re probably dense enough to briefly think it’s the top grade before realising it isn’t and pretending you knew all along. 
2-3: Grades for pupils who did not see the point of school. Not of much practical use, but at least you’ll be able to look back on cherished memories like melting that geeky kid’s pens in a bunsen burner until he cried.
4-5: Congratulations! You’re in the zone where technically you got GCSEs, and they’re better than some people’s, but they still don’t count for anything and no employer or educational institution will ever be interested. Why does this zone even exist?
6: You’re probably bright but fucked about just that little bit too much. Or maybe you’re thick and tried your best but it wasn’t good enough. Either way this near-miss is the most tragic of grades. 
7: You are over the line. You scraped a real grade, and as a reward you will never have to study, use or think about this subject again. 
8: A good grade, but if you’ve got a certain type of parents – possibly Guardian readers – it will disappoint them deeply. They will sit you down at the kitchen table, their faces drawn and anguished, asking what went wrong as if you’re in prison for heroin offences.

Things you’ve been doing wrong for years according to bullshit articles,"FROM eating pasta to putting on your socks, you’ve probably been doing it wrong for years – at least according to articles like this. Here’s how to correct your mistakes.
Cooking pasta 
You’ve probably been boiling it in water with a pinch of salt, right? WRONG! Italians soak their pasta in a bucket of cold water for a week, put it in a liquidiser and suck it up through a straw. 
Tying your laces 
Most people just tie a simple bow then walk around all day without problems. This is clearly inadequate. Tie your laces with a double half hitch knot (ask a sailor), put superglue on so it goes solid, then nail your shoes to your feet. 
Building a wicker man
You probably build your horrific effigy first and bundle the human sacrifice in later. But it’s much easier to tie up your victim and build the wicker man AROUND him before hauling it erect with ropes and setting fire to it.
Peeling an orange
Here’s a brilliant ‘life hack’ we got from some tit on the internet – buy orange Tropicana with bits in and freeze it in 4” spheres. Hey presto, ready-peeled oranges with no mess and no fuss.
Having sex 
You probably think you’ve got sex figured out, but you’re actually meant to just hold hands and wait for a stork to bring you a baby. Sex is actually a relatively modern invention dating back to the 1940s when only a few people had televisions.

Indie band reunites for one last argument,"AN INDIE band from the Britpop era have announced they are reuniting for a final massive argument.
Lupus Gazebo, who made 43 appearances on tapes that came free with the NME, released a statement on their website telling fans they would be in Sheffield this November for a comeback disagreement.
Lead singer Tom Booker said: “We’re not doing this for the money, we’re doing this for the fans. And also because Carl still hasn’t paid the rest of us back from when he crashed the van without insurance and I’m still massively pissed off about it.
“When I see him and the rest of those arseholes it’s going to be like we never went away. Get ready for some classic rows, including the one about eating spicy food on the tour bus and the one about Martin not sharing his coke even though he bought it with money from the band kitty.

If you enjoyed my ‘jerk rice’ you’ll love these authentic cultural flavours from around the foreign world.
Samurai prawns
The ancient Japanese warrior class needed a slap-up feed after a big battle. As you tuck in imagine you’re a deadly swordsman and the sweet-and-sour dipping sauce is the blood of your enemies.
Tibetan buddhist pepperoni pizza 
Buddhist monks are all I can think of to do with Tibet but because they were such laid-back dudes they probably loved to chill with pizza and a movie. Comes with garlic dip for a truly spiritual experience.
Pasta al Wall’s Viennetta 
This traditional Italian dish consists of spaghetti in mint ice cream sauce with dark chocolate sprayed on top to make it look ‘classy’ if you are a bit common. 
French-style gourmet beans on toast 
Haute cuisine pioneers like Escoffier loved their grub, so they wouldn’t have hesitated to perk up their baked beans with some grated cheddar. Only takes 30 seconds in the microwave, so you don’t have to devote your life to the art of cooking. 
Southern fried bangers and mash

Nan explains latest confusing reasons for voting Tory,"A NAN who lives in a local authority affected by Tory cuts has given an utterly incomprehensible account of why she always votes for them.
Mary Fisher of Northampton is opposed to things like library closures, but doggedly votes Conservative for reasons that would baffle even the most brilliant psychologist.
Fisher said: “My main reason for voting Conservative is a documentary I saw 20 years ago about a family from Leeds. I forget the details but the son was a right little so-and-so.
“I wouldn’t want them living next door, and the same applies to Australians. They’ve got a jokey attitude so you don’t want them doing something important like flying a plane.
“By voting Conservative I feel it somehow stops bad things happening, even though I think they’re smarmy gits just in it for themselves who’ve done nothing about all the wasps.
“Still, it’s better than Arthur Scargill running the country. Or Gerry Adams. What a pair they are. Never trust a man with a beard, I say.”

She continued: “It was a combination of things, really. The shopping-mall decor, the other passengers, and the constant attempts to sell you overpriced glitzy tat just built up until I decided the sea would be better. 
“And, while it wasn’t fantastic bobbing in the waves in total darkness, at least nobody tried to make me watch a fourth-place X Factor contestant or go for a spa treatment. 
“As soon as I touched land, I asked ‘And there’s no coach waiting to take me back to the ship in four hours, after I’ve bought enough of the local jewellery or whatever? I’m free?'”

Britain’s favourite sexual position is watching television,"BRITAIN’S favourite sexual position is watching the television, according to a new survey.
Tom Logan and his girlfriend Emma Thomas, who have been together for eight years, are among the 95 percent of long-term couples that prefer to have sex this way.
Logan said: “We thought our sex life was dead but then Emma she suggested we try something new that she’d ‘seen in a magazine’, which got me quite excited. It was the Radio Times.
“She told me to stay fully dressed and sit on the sofa with my eyes open. She then gripped tightly onto the remote, one thing led to another and before you know it we were watching a repeat of QI on Dave.”

Can it ever be morally right to stop drinking after four pints?,"YOU’RE four pints in. The highlight of your evening is behind you. But is it ever ethically defensible to say ‘Right lads, I don’t want to spend another 30 quid to feel like shit, I’m off home?’ Take our quiz to find out. 
Are you a killjoy? 
A) I’m not a killjoy, I’ve just had enough that’s all. I don’t want to end up like last week when I went all the way to the nightclub just to be chucked out for throwing up in the smoking area.
B) You’re a fucking killjoy is what you are mate. Si, get him another drink in. Put a Jägerbomb in it.
Are you abandoning the lads? 
A) The ‘lads’ are all well over 30 and can handle themselves, unlike me, who was found trying to get a night bus that turned out to be a National Express to Hull a fortnight ago. The ‘lads’ will be fine.
B) You’re abandoning the lads. You’re abandoning the team. We have to stick together in this world full of fuckers, you know that. Is that twat on the pool table looking at me?
Are you pussy-whipped? 
A) I don’t have a girlfriend. She dumped me after you put photos of me with that stripper, that I don’t even remember meeting, on their WhatsApp group. I just want to be alone.

How not to be Madonna when you hit 60,"ARE you wondering if you should be like Madonna when you hit the big 6-0? The answer is probably ‘no’, so here is a guide to not being an ageing pop megalomaniac in later life.
By all means wear youthful clothes but try to be age-appropriate. Avoid going to the library in six-inch stilettos, a black leather thong and a bondage harness.
Try not to flirt with lesbianism to get attention. Snogging your friend Audrey at a Women’s Institute meeting will put everyone off their ginger cake and really it’s a bit insulting to people who are sincere about their sexuality.
Don’t seduce a string of much-younger male dancers while your husband Geoff is pottering about in the shed. You know what his blood pressure is like.
Avoid being obsessed with looking the same as you were 35 years ago. The odd Botox treatment can be a great confidence booster, but your grandchildren will freak out if you start looking like a prototype android.
Get a worthwhile hobby, maybe creative writing or volunteering. Don’t make a series of pisspoor films that are clearly embarrassing vanity projects made worse by your total lack of filmmaking knowledge.
Don’t go on a punishing 60-date musical tour in which you grimly try to do everything a 25-year-old trained dancer can. If you put your back out it’s your own fault. 
Try not to show people your arse at every opportunity. This is nothing to do with being 60, it’s just fucking abnormal when anyone does it.",NaN,17th August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/madonna-weird-outfit-2.jpg,Fake
Cheeky bastards asking for help with renovations want friends to be their slaves,"A COUPLE asking friends to ‘pitch in’ with their home improvements essentially want their friends to be unpaid slave labour.

Emma Logan said: “We went on to explain that we can pay in love and gratitude. But not money, obviously. That’s expensive.
“We’re hoping there’ll be a ‘DIY party’ atmosphere so the issue of unpaid labour won’t come up. Come on guys, there’s nothing more fun than sanding skirting boards for hours on end.
“We could even stretch to a hot meal – if one of them can install an oven.”
Friend Nathan Muir said: “Doing work without payment is pretty much the definition of slavery. If they got some whips and guard dogs at least it would be more honest.
“Unfortunately ‘love and gratitude’ is not a recognised currency I can use to pay my electricity bill. I’ll see if they accept it in Sainsbury’s, but I think probably not.”

Middle aged man vows to one day find out what a carb is,"A 55-YEAR-OLD reading the newspaper over a full cooked breakfast has renewed his commitment to discovering what a carb is. 
After reading that a high-carb diet can shorten life expectancy but not as much as a low-carb one, lorry driver Wayne Hayes has sworn to find out what a carb looks like and if he is presently eating any. 
He said: “I should have done this back in the 00s, when everyone was on that Atkins, but I’ve always felt taking an interest in what you eat is just for bodybuilders and fat women. 
“I know protein is eggs and meat, fat’s like… chips? I haven’t a fucking clue what milk is. And then there’s greens. I don’t see where carbs would fit in there to be honest. Do you have to ask for them specially? 
“I could be living a no-carb lifestyle for all I know. The doctor never mentions it, he just says have less fry-ups. Maybe I could get carbs on prescription with my heart pills.” 
When informed by a fellow driver that the meal he had just finished was, in fact, very high in carbs, Hayes replied: “That’s not a carb. It’s a sausage.”

‘I never dreamed about success. I worked for it’
Do you work in an office doing something dreary with data inputting? Do you constantly go on about your dream of opening a gourmet sausage roll shop but do fuck all about it? This one is for you.
‘Sometimes when things are falling apart they may actually be falling into place’
Tell yourself this when your wife has found out you’ve been cheating on her and she’s just sprayed ‘WANKER’ across your car windscreen. Remember: sometimes things are just falling apart.
‘The smile on a child’s face is worth a million dollars!’

‘A problem is a chance for you to do your best’

‘Be a pineapple: stand tall, wear a crown and be sweet on the inside’

Which WhatsApp group is ruining your life?,"WHATSAPP is a nightmarish deluge of unwanted crap and distractions. So which groups in particular are sapping your time and general will to live?
The lads’ bants group
It started as a group to organise a lads’ holiday in 2012 but is still going, like a porn mag being passed round school in the 1980s. This group makes you say things that are totally out of character and see things you can’t now un-see, such as a midget electrocuting his own cock.
The friends you’re not really friends with group
This group is for making insincere plans you have no intention of seeing through but which you’ll spend forever thinking about, eg. ‘How can I say I’m not doing that 100-mile run I only agreed to because I’d had nine glasses of wine?’
The pictures of kids for grandparents group
You didn’t get enough attention as a kid. Your parents were a bit too pleased when you left home. Now this group allows you to carry on this unspoken personal war. 
Your method of attack is to bombard them with pictures of your happy kids. They retaliate with pictures of themselves drinking in the garden and making chutney. You put up more pictures of your kids. And so the bitter psychological conflict continues endlessly, like Vietnam but more passive-aggressive. 
The work group
This WhatsApp group starts casually to organise work drinks, but soon becomes a cutthroat game of which crawly bastard is going to get promoted first.

"Why A-levels are bullshit, by someone with a D and two Es","By Tom Logan, A-level student
I BELIEVE now is the time to address the issue of A-levels being stupid bullshit, which has nothing to do with my somewhat underwhelming results of D, E, E and U.
Let’s get one thing straight. A-levels do not prove you’re intelligent. There are many types of intelligence, such as ‘emotional intelligence’ or being intelligent at catching a ball. So with that myth demolished, let me move on.
All A-levels prove is you can digest information and make a logical argument. But what use is that in the real world where someone could come at you with a knife? 
Subjects like chemistry are obsolete these days because everyone works at a computer. It’s obvious that A-levels are just a scam to keep nitpicking mediocrities like Mr Gosling, our head of sixth-form, off the dole queue.   
But the most damning criticism of A-levels is that most successful people don’t have any qualifications. Hard to believe, I know, and I haven’t checked it, but Sir Alan Sugar, Mark Zuckerberg and Alfred Einstein haven’t got a GCSE between them!
To a smart guy like me it’s clear the way to succeed is to sit in your bedroom inventing a smash hit app like Angry Birds, which I am going to do when mum gets back from Tesco with an A4 pad and some felt-tips.
So let’s ditch this A-level bullshit and allocate places at uni based on important skills: whether you’re a nice person and if you can play bass. If they did that I’d have a place at Oxford.
I wouldn’t go though, because now I intend to go travelling and use my real-life wisdom to become incredibly rich, although I might just go to Keele via clearing.",NaN,16th August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/teenager-male-2.jpg,Fake

Telegraph readers demand more stuff about Muslims and a free pair of gardening gloves,"READERS of the Telegraph have confirmed they want more anti-Muslim propaganda and a free pair of gardening gloves.
After Boris Johnson’s comments about burqa wearers proved massively pleasing to them, Telegraph subscribers said they would like to see the newspaper really hammering Muslims and also doing a gardening gloves giveaway where you collect the tokens.
86-year-old Roy Hobbs said: “It’s about time somebody had a go at the Muslims, you definitely never see that in any other British newspapers.
“I’d like it if the Telegraph was all about Muslims apart from some vouchers that you cut out every week and then when you’ve got ten you send them off in an envelope and get a free pair of gardening gloves – blue for men or pink for women.
“Gardening is a wonderful way to relax when you’re stressed out and exhausted from thinking about Muslims.”
A Telegraph spokesman said: “It’s always useful to hear reader feedback, especially as we’re currently targeting a younger 81 to 94-year-old demographic.”
Hobbs added: “I’m not sure if the Telegraph can help but people still keep turning in my driveway even though I’ve put a sign up.

"I can’t wait to see Jason Statham fight a massive vagina, sorry I mean shark","by Wayne Hayes, founder of the Statham Appreciation Society
AS a huge fan of the Stath I’ve always wanted to see him punch a giant predatory vagina – oops I meant to say shark.
Jason Statham is the ultimate embodiment of masculinity, and vaginas are the ultimate aquatic evil.
Shit sorry did I say vaginas again? Duh! Clearly I meant sharks. I don’t hate or fear vaginas in any way, even if they represent a gaping maw of vicious female darkness that lurks in the shadowy waiting to devour innocent men who only want to enjoy football, affordable sports cars and the pub.
I think women are great, even if they are too daft to understand why The Transporter is the greatest film ever made, or to want a long-term relationship with me.
Although – and I know this might not be considered very ‘PC’ in some quarters – the I do like the idea of a film about a massive vagina that swims around eating men, or even just toying with their emotions and then callously rejecting them.
In fact I’ve already written a script called The Vadge in which Jase and his funny Chinese sidekick ‘Short Trousers’ face off with a 500ft labia in an underwater cave system. So if any film producers are reading this, give me a shout. But I will want to keep all the rights to ‘The Vadge’ spin-off burgers and pencil cases.",NaN,13th August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/meg667.jpg,Fake

The rest of her team are morons who are obsessed with house prices and big tellies, she will probably have to keep working there until she is really old.
Team leader Stephen Malley asked Kramer: “What’s up with you this morning? You look like you got out of bed on the wrong side.
“Have you got period pains? Because you know that’s not a proper excuse, right?”
Tom Booker, who sits opposite Kramer, also wondered why she was in a mood and speculated that it might be because she needs a “good portion”.
Kramer said: “If you must know it’s because I hate this job, and you people, with every fibre of my being. And we’re all trapped in a stupid, vicious consumerist culture from which the only obvious escape is getting pissed a lot or death.

Be there for them when nobody else is
Show up when nobody else would. This could be during bathroom breaks, when they’re showering, sleeping or at their children’s school football match.
Have your picture taken with them
Stand behind them while they sit at their desk. This makes them look important and you look like an obsequious turd who’s desperate for the slightest validation. They like that.
Tell them their eyes sparkle
Sure, you like your boss’s eyes, but more specifically, you like the way they dance with delight. Also, tell them they have fantastic thighs.
Make a list of people they are better than
Gareth Southgate is a great manager, but compared to your boss he’s as useless as Iain Duncan Smith or Gordon Brown. And any fucking idiot could have started Amazon.
Bring in homemade gifts 
It could be a mug, some lollipop sticks you stuck together or a life-size bust of your boss sculpted from finest Italian marble.

A. Politely tells the waiter he’s been given the wrong meal and waits for the correct one to arrive.
B. Opens fire on the whole restaurant with a Gatling gun before throwing you over his shoulder, blasting his way past the concierge and escaping on a big motorcycle.
When he meets your parents, how does he come across?

B. He accuses your father of being a shape-shifting robot that’s been sent back from the same future as him and is planning to kill you. He also gets on well with the dog.
He’s thinking about proposing. Does he ask your dad first?

The Wetherspoons guide to manners and etiquette,"RECENTLY a Wetherspoons refused to serve two homeless men. So how can you make sure you are not turned away from this elite drinking establishment? Read our guide.
Have perfect table manners
Your fork should be held in your left hand like a spoon to shovel up your full English, while your right hand should be used to hold your pint. Anything else is simply unacceptable.
Be courteous to ladies
A gentleman always asks a lady if she wants some crisps. Also be sure to pay her regular compliments about her appearance, eg. “You have the most exquisite tits, Kelly-Marie.” 
If you should be so lucky as to ‘pull’ a lovely Spoons enchantress, do the chivalrous thing and buy her an extra large doner with everything.
Consider whether your conversation is appropriate
It is bad form to hold forth on topics that may offend the sensibilities of others. Subjects to avoid include: Brexit not being excellent; Britain having an acceptable number of immigrants; why Nigel Farage cannot automatically be prime minister.
Observe the dress code
Ensure your tracksuit is starched and from a respected tailor such as Sports Direct, not a fake brand off the market called ‘Adridas’ which may set you ablaze when you savour a fine cigar or roll-up.
For ladies: Retain your feminine mystique by allowing no more than 25% of your be-thonged arse to be exposed by your jogging bottoms.
Be polite at all times
Coarse language is not tolerated in Wetherspoons. Do not say “Fuck off, d’you want to take this outside?”. Instead say: “May we perambulate, sir, to a suitable arena for a pugilistic exchange?”",NaN,9th August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/wetherspoon-pub-2.jpg,Fake

How to easily survive if you’re a character in a horror film,"HAVE you got a demon in your basement or are you planning to go hiking in hillbilly country? Don’t worry – just follow our guide to surviving horror movies.
Just leave
If you’re convinced a cabin in the woods is attracting evil entities, simply leave and never come back. You wouldn’t stay to investigate a dangerous but non-paranormal bear, and you can easily find another cheap holiday on the internet.
Reach obvious conclusions
Don’t spend days puzzling over the identity of the mysterious figures lurking near the abandoned Nazi bunker full of occult symbols and half-eaten corpses. They are not lollipop ladies, trainee accountants or Simon & Garfunkel.
Get the authorities involved
If ghosts in your home start harming you immediately contact the police. They’ll think you’re mad at first but once they see proof they’ll be legally obliged to protect you.
Similarly, scientists will be desperate to study your ghosts. What are malevolent spirits going to do, wipe out dozens of researchers from Imperial College? You’ll be able to charge them millions to study this incredible phenomenon too.
Escape after meeting the first inbred weirdo
Rather than wait until a whole family of cannibals are chopping you up, run like hell after meeting the first clearly inbred oddball with a bad attitude.
Buy a book on demons straight away
All horror film demons can be quickly identified in a demonology book. At the first sign of demon aggro get one from Amazon with next-day delivery. You’ll immediately know their backstory before they can abduct your kids to another dimension. Doddle.
Become a Christian
As soon as Satan is linked to evil goings-on, do the logical thing and worship God. Satan can’t exist without God and is much weaker, so basically he can fuck off now.

Five ways you can be an twat when someone else is talking,"WHETHER someone is hosting a meeting or telling a story, they are taking precious attention away from you. Here are five handy ways you can get the focus back on yourself by being an absolute shit.
Interrupt with an irrelevant question
Aren’t great stories horrible? The way they enrapture everyone around the table but you. Best to wait to the crescendo of the tale then butt in with an irrelevant question. It’s the narrative equivalent of a hard kick in the genitals.
Yawn
Yawns are as infectious as herpes. You can kill any atmosphere created with a really loud yawn as soon as someone starts speaking. Obviously apologise but in the full realisation your work is already done.
Eye-roll
Managing people is really hard, so if you feel someone is hosting a meeting well undermine them with eye-rolls. It’s amazing how you can convey to everyone in the room that the person speaking is a dick just with your ratty little eyeballs.
Teeth suck
Like the eye-roll but with enhanced audio. Sucking on your teeth is brilliant for showing your disdain for a speaker by making a weird, really annoying little sound that could pass as you just trying to remove some ham from your head.
Coughing fit
Your dinner party host is being really charming. Stop them dead with a coughing fit, which you can amp up by asking everyone if they think the room is really hot too?

“You Northerners are fond of telling Southerners we’re soft, but have you ever been trapped all afternoon on the North Circular with nothing to eat except half a bottle of Evian and two Polos?
“There’s heavy goods vehicles trying to get from Epping to Guildford that set out in 2012 and they’re still only in Clapham.
“In a proper London jam you might never move again. Just yesterday I armed myself with the jack handle in case we were stuck there permanently and people started turning cannibal.”

Middle-class woman runs out of hobbies to pathetically give up on,"A MIDDLE-CLASS woman has officially run out of creative projects to abandon.
35-year-old Emma Bradford came to the realisation after adding an unfinished hand-weaved basket to her pile of crap handicraft projects in a cupboard.

“I’m usually about a quarter of the way in before I realise that making my own soap isn’t going to cut it. 
“Once I’m halfway through I tend to think things like ‘Why the fuck am I crocheting a hat?’ and give up completely.
“I’ve done jewellery-making, knitting, sewing, you name it. I’ve built half a dolls’ house, I’ve done watercolours that look like my five-year-old did them and I started painting bottles for some reason.

Jeremy Corbyn’s guide to acting decisively,"HELLO, comrades. As a top politician I know only too well the importance of acting swiftly and decisively. Here’s how to take the bull by the horns in a variety of real-life situations.
Noisy neighbours 
Set up a music volume committee and invite your neighbours to take part. If they tell you to sod off, buy them some quieter music, eg. Mellow Moods on the Pan Pipes rather than Dubstep Apocalypse Volume 8.
Burglar in your property
It’s all too easy to call the police in a panic or grab a weapon. Instead commission a report entitled They Stole My MacBook: Perspectives on Theft in a Globalised World.
If you have to confront the burglar, make him aware he is harming his own community rather than the ruling elite. If he refuses rehabilitative training such a plumbing course, only then should you twat him with a cricket bat. 
Confronted by a fierce dog 
If you’re in the park and are attacked by a dog, act quickly and get out your phone to set up an independent inquiry headed by a respected barrister.
Ideally you should establish working definitions of ‘being mauled’, ‘massive teeth’ and ‘serious blood loss’. Let the dog have its say, assuming it has not already run off with your testicles.
House on fire
Before rushing to put out the fire it’s important to establish the facts. Is that smoke or just steam from the kettle? Are people screaming “Fire!” because the building is ablaze or are they just singing along to The Crazy World of Arthur Brown? 
When you are sure there is a fire, call 999 and insist that only a gender-balanced team of firefighters should be sent to rescue you.
Fight in a pub
If someone says “Did you spill my pint?”, refuse to commit to whether you did or did not spill the pint because to do so would be playing into the hands of the Tory press.",NaN,3rd August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/corbyn-2-1.jpg,Fake
Man who’s slept with loads of women just has no standards and lies a lot,"A MAN who has bedded a vast number of women does it by sleeping with anyone and lying frequently.
Stephen Malley has had sex with 548 women, but the secrets of his success are not being picky in any way, giving false information about himself and generally being a sleazy ballbag.
Malley said: “I’m sort of like Casanova or James Bond, except my Mercedes is hired and I still live with my mum.
“Even so I’ve had a fuck of a lot of minge. Okay, some of them weren’t exactly supermodels, but you’re not looking at the mantelpiece when you’re poking the fire, as we suave ladies’ men like to say.
“It’s all about confidence, dressing well and giving the ladies lots of respect and attention before you fuck off the next day to play football with your mates and brag about it.
“And let’s be honest – women like a man with a good job and prospects. That’s why I tell them I’m a trainee barrister, an RAF pilot or on my way to becoming a tech millionaire.
“It’s not really lying because I’d quite like to do those things if I ever leave Carphone Warehouse.”

“You do know what I’m talking about, right? Good. Just wanted to check.”
Wayne’s mother Susan Hayes did not seem too concerned about her son’s drug habit.

Tom Logan and Nikki Hollis believe friends in the pub were gripped by their account of their daughter’s attempts to say ‘daddy’, which lasted almost half an hour. 
Hollis said: “It’s a wonderful story because Emily-Rose tries to day ‘daddy’ but it comes out as ‘taga’. Who’d have thought babies did things like that? 
“I set the scene with a detailed description of Emily-Rose’s activities – crying, eating, sleeping – then launched into the main story. I should probably become a children’s author like Roald Dahl.
“You could tell everyone was enjoying it because they kept nodding slightly. Martin in particular loved it. The grin on his face was absolutely fixed.”
Logan said: “Nikki told the story brilliantly but I added some great impressions of Emily-Rose saying ‘taga’. I said it about 30 times because Sally laughed politely every time.

Mark Kermode’s top films that are set in his own rectum,"HI, I’m Mark Kermode and it’s fine if you think I’m a twat.
But I’m not here to talk to about the reasons you might dislike me without ever having met me, today I’m here to tell you about my favourite films that are set entirely in my back passage. So, let’s begin…
In the Dark
It’s dark, it’s scary. Well, it would be, wouldn’t it? It’s my anus after all.
The Arsenator Franchise
Now, as everyone knows, I’m not usually one for franchises and all that kind of thing but The Arsenator movies are different. They’re subtle, wonderfully observed, tender at times but also pretty non-stop when they get going.
Conversations at the Back Door
A beautiful film, filled with ordinary people, all just talking out of their own back doors. You can probably see why I like it so much.
The Arsorcist
I love this classic horror film, just love it. It has everything, suspense, drama, just everything. At it’s heart it’s the story of an ordinary family who might be the victims of a hostile paranormal entity or they may just be up my arse. The director bravely leaves it to the viewer to decide (although if you ask me, they’re up my arse).",NaN,1st August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/kermode667.jpg,Fake
Middle-aged people ask ‘Generation Sensible’ what it’s like having sex sober,"MIDDLE-AGED people have asked the younger fitness-obsessed generation what sex is like when you aren’t drunk.
Joseph Turner, 58, did not think sex was possible without the aid of wine, scotch and a packet of dry roasted peanuts for energy.
Turner said: “Alcohol helps my wife believe she’s with Daniel Craig and not a man who subscribes to Classic Car magazine.
“And with Chardonnay’s help my wife looks like Catherine Zeta Jones and not the woman who constantly nags me for a better conservatory.”
23-year-old Susan Traherne said: “We don’t actually have sex because we’re too busy either at the gym or worrying about house prices.
“If we were to have intercourse it would purely be for reproductive purposes, or as part of some incredibly depressing ‘five year plan’.”",NaN,1st August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/older667.jpg,Fake
Which zoo animals are the easiest to steal?,"WITH school summer holidays under way, now is a great time to visit the zoo and perhaps steal one of the animals.
Here, in reverse order, are the best animals to nick.
Galapagos tortoise
These majestic creatures, the largest species of tortoise in the world, are enclosed by only a small wooden fence. They can be heavy, so team up with an accomplice, or invest in a sturdy wheelbarrow, before committing to stealing one. They also live to be 200, giving you plenty of time to enjoy your spoils.
Humbolt penguin 
Walk into the penguin enclosure dressed as a zoo employee – zoo employees do it all the time. If challenged, explain that you are a psychiatrist there to check none of the penguins are depressed. Once you’re in, just grab a penguin and just walk out with it. All penguins are basically identical, making your theft unlikely to be discovered until you are safely on the road with your new friend.
Stick insect
Replace the stick insect with a medium-sized stick; it is likely to be weeks before anyone notices.
Malayan tapir
Tapirs are placid and passive creatures, and the Zoological Society of London has been complacent in assuming they will not try to escape. Slip it some strong stimulants, such as coffee or dark chocolate, then overpower the guards and ride it to freedom.
Ring-tailed lemur
Lemurs have a mischievous nature, and will not need much encouragement to run away with you. Spend some time near the enclosure to build trust, and use your phone – or perhaps an iPad – to show the lemurs episodes of Prison Break. After three or four seasons, offer them a bag with Wentworth Miller’s face on it and they will jump right in.",NaN,1st August 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/lemur667.jpg,Fake

Kind, thoughtful man Nathan Muir said: “I’ve spent years cultivating my nice image, only to find out that loads of other men have been doing it too.
“It’s really annoying because being nice is my thing. I was actually the first man to ever think of it.
“The other week I offered to help my friend Nikki move, to show her I’m not like the other bastards in her life, and that what she really wants is a nice guy like me.
“Then what bloody happens? She brings her mate Tom along to help, with him claiming that ‘many hands make light work’. Who the hell is this Tom with his weird politeness and thoughtfulness? I bet he’s only pretending to be nice to hump her.

Is your child enough of a little shit for primary school?,"AFTER government warnings about children being unprepared for primary school, how can you ensure your kids have the right ‘little bastard’ skills? Read our guide.
Discourage sitting still
Teach kids it’s fine to run around wailing like a banshee the moment they feel slightly bored, or if they just really need everyone to look at them.
Are they aggressive enough?
Before starting school, children should be given questionable macho advice about bullying from dad, e.g. “You’ve got permission from me to stick up for yourself with your fists”, which their immature brains will obviously interpret as “it’s fine to twat people.”
Make sure they kill the school pets
Not in the grisly ‘future serial killer’ sense, but by being the sort of gormless little shit who releases Jojo the hamster into the wild for a taste of freedom and rapid death.
Give them a mobile phone
Even very small children will soon get the hang of disrupting lessons with their mobile. For added annoyance value encourage them to ring home for the slightest reason, such as confirming they have eaten their crisps.
Give them pointless extra lessons at home

Houseplants a complete f**king waste of time,"OWNING a houseplant adds absolutely nothing to your life and very little to the houseplant’s, scientists have confirmed. 
Wide-ranging research into the supposed benefits of keeping vegetation around the house has shown that it benefits nobody while wasting time, money, effort and possibly oxygen.

George R R Martin’s guide to procrastination,"HOW to avoid doing any work, by Game of Thrones creator George R R Martin.
Although I am good at writing fantasy books, I am even better at avoiding writing fantasy books.
Usually when I wake up the first thing that flashes across my mind is ‘shit, I’d better finish those throne books’. It gives me a sort of sick feeling, if I’m honest. Then I start thinking about thrones, how they’re quite like toilets and how I probably need to buy a new toilet. So I drive to the bathroom shop and have a wander round there for a bit, buy a toilet and then put it in the garage with all my other spare toilets.
By that point it’s usually about half eleven, so I sit down at the computer. Time to do some serious writing, perhaps about dragons. I decide to research dragons on the internet in case I’ve forgotten what they are. Then I also end up googling drain unblocker, amazing BMX tricks and watching a whole episode of Harry and the Hendersons on YouTube (less funny than I remember).
Then I go and have a sandwich and quickly check to see if Game of Thrones is on TV, because if so they might have some ideas I can use. It isn’t, so instead I watch the 80s fantasy film Willow with Val Kilmer. It’s quite good.
I go outside and have a look at my house, just to check it’s not on fire. It isn’t.
By now it’s 4pm and time to really crack on. Unfortunately my desk has a wonky leg so I spend half an hour fixing that with some beer mats. Then I sit down ready to at least wank out 500 words before dinner, just as the doorbell goes.
It’s the Amazon guy with the latest Game of Thrones book! I’m disappointed to discover that I’ve already read it, in fact I wrote it, but it’s good to be sure.

Couple arguing in public are bloody excellent,"A COUPLE who had a blazing row in public both entertained bystanders and gave them a valuable psychological boost.
The latest public slanging match between Wayne Hayes and Donna Sheridan left people feeling incredibly cheerful about not being trapped in their fraught domestic hell. 
Onlooker Tom Logan said: “Obviously there was the entertainment value, like when she called him an ‘impotent tight-arsed piss-weasel’. I felt that was very creative. 
“But it affected me at a deeper level too. I’d actually just been made redundant but after hearing him say ‘Where’s your broomstick, you rancid old slagbag?’ I realised my problems were tiny compared to being in that relationship.”
Fellow bystander Francesca Ryan said: “What I enjoyed about the row was that it made me feel so much better about my own partner Jeff, who I often think is a bit of a twat.
“However Jeff and I only argue in private and it’s usually about something fairly tangible, like him being a selfish arse who needs to lose weight. I love him so much.”
Psychologist Dr Nathan Muir said: “Watching a couple arguing in public is as good for your mental health as a six-week holiday on an idyllic beach accompanied by a Labrador puppy.”

Heatwave advice for people who lack even the most basic common sense,"HOT weather can be dangerous if you do not understand anything.
Britain is basking in the glorious sunshine of a long heatwave – but it can be hard to enjoy the sun safely if you are shit thick. Here is some advice for you:
If you stand naked in direct sunlight for a long time, you may start to experience discomfort caused by your skin burning off. One clue to this is a smell like roasting pork coming from your flesh.
Avoid staring directly at the sun. This should be easy enough to do as there is no practical reason why you would ever need to stare at the sun.
That feeling of dryness in your body is called ‘thirst’. It means it is time to have a drink. Not beer though. Fight the urge to drink more beer.
Water is best ingested through your mouth. Do not try to pour it up your nose.
Remember, whatever the weather, to keep breathing in and out. Breathing is an important part of not dying.

“Men can’t masturbate in baths for the same reason you can’t start an old lawnmower in a jacuzzi.”
Office manager Emma Bradford said: “The key is being able to multi-task. My male colleagues find it impossible to frot themselves off while compiling a quarterly sales report in Excel.
“Also, their idea of cunning is to look themselves in the disabled toilet for 15 minutes then emerge muttering something about ‘bad prawns’.”

B. Admit you are still crying over accidentally leaving a tenner tip at Pizza Express when you only meant to leave a fiver because the dough balls were cold.

How are you pretending to be busy at work?,"WHAT devious techniques are you using to look as if you’re working when you’re not? Read our guide – and maybe even learn some new ways to skive!
Unnecessary photocopying
Bad for the environment, but great when you’ve got a hangover. If someone asks why you just spent an hour copying paper documents, angrily reply: “At least some of us are prepared for a cyber attack, Gavin!”
Internet skiving 2.0
Nowadays everyone knows you’d rather be browsing than working, so cover your back by loudly shouting out, “Has anyone else’s spreadsheets been hacked by Facebook?”
Carry an Important Document at all times
This makes you look as if you’re doing something vital when you’re just going for a relaxing stroll round the building. If you’ve printed out a Batman comic to read in the lift make sure the top sheet is something business-related, such as your company’s plunging profit figures.
Become a ‘mentor’
Offer to ‘mentor’ a younger colleague. You’ll discover you can actually get paid for nothing more taxing than listening to their pathetic fantasies about joining the ‘management stream’.
To block out their dreary, naive ramblings put in your earphones and claim they’re hearing aids because you are so old and wise, even if you’re 31. 
Organise bullshit meetings
Good meetings can really achieve something. Those are the wrong meetings. Organise something unfocused and pointless such as a ‘creative innovation and efficiency brainstorm’, with sushi.
Take charge of all the activities that aren’t really work 
Booking a Christmas do, watering the plants, buying doughnuts – these are all piss-easy activities you can offer to do and look like a ‘team player’ to boot.

Second referendum to include ‘Are you an idiot?’,"ANOTHER vote on leaving the EU should include questions designed to weed out total idiots, it has been claimed.
The Institute for Studies has been investigating how to prevent the vote being swayed by people who live in a Murdoch-fuelled fantasy world and have zero common sense, like last time.
Professor Henry Brubaker said: “The obvious question is ‘Are you an idiot?’ but most idiots think they’re geniuses so they’ll say ‘no’ even if they’re too thick to understand the concept of lying.
“It’s better to ask things like ‘Are you sick of the EU trying to destroy the British banana industry?’ or ‘Is it time the EU did something about all the potholes in the roads?’.
“Alternatively there could be very basic tests of idiocy, such as ‘Does Lord of the Rings depict an actual period of British history?’ or ‘Do you regularly eat raw chicken?’.
“If people answer ‘yes’ their ballot paper can go straight in the bin. It’s not very democratic but then neither is lying about 99.9 per cent of things to do with the EU.”

Your guide to making sure no one sits next to you on the train,"THE only way to stop a disgusting stranger sitting next to you on the train is to be that disgusting stranger. Here’s our guide to ensuring peace and quiet on your journey. 
Take a portable cooker
Guzzling smelly food like an animal is already popular on trains, but for the maximum effect take a camping stove. Frying up a nice bit of liver will save you the cost of a sandwich and really kill some time on a boring journey.
Neglect your personal hygiene 
Try not to wash, brush your teeth or use deodorant in the weeks leading up to your train journey. There’s a risk of gum disease or scabies but it’s worth it to avoid some twat looking at porn on his iPad like that’s normal now.
Use the power of Special Brew 
Have a couple of cans of Spesh before you board the train, giving your breath a good ‘trampy’ aroma. Then put a few more cans on the table and drink them throughout the journey. The nausea will pass once the alcohol kicks in.
Note: This works best if your journey is to a job interview or date with someone you really like.
Take some bizarre item with you 
Dogs and massive suitcases are ideal ‘seat blockers’, but if you take something strange people will be even more reluctant to ask you to move it. Try an old boiler or harpoon gun.
Make a sign saying ‘Do not sit here’
However amateurish, the sign will appeal to people’s natural fear of authority. If someone asks who put it there, say ‘the police’.
Just put your bag on the seat next to you 
An obvious ploy, but this is Britain – nobody will ask you to move it. Aside from a few passive-aggressive clucks, there will be no consequences at all except being hated forever by the guy standing all the way from Euston to Stoke.",NaN,13th July 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/woman-train-seat-2.jpg,Fake

Today
11am. Meeting with Theresa May at Chequers
Topics to include security, the Middle East and UK-US trade. Trump will take an old copy of Hustler and his only contribution will be to show people porn stars he banged in the 1980s.
2pm. Crazy announcement out of the blue
Completely contrary to the spirit of cooperation, Trump will suddenly announce some horrifically anti-UK policy like demanding his new bud Kim Jong-un is allowed to use Kent as a ‘missile testing zone’.
3pm. Meet Queen
Trump to rapidly lose interest when he realises the Queen is not hottie Claire Foy from TV series The Crown. Plans to grab Queen’s ‘pussy’ abandoned.
4pm. Completely incomprehensible speech
Sample: “England, America, yeah. I was at a cocktail party in Manhattan. Great, great party. Franny Humpenfinkel was there. Owns 22 stud farms. Bigly good guy. But the point is – Hillary is a liar. A liar and a murderer. That’s it. No more questions.” 
Saturday
10am. Meet with senior UK politicians and diplomats and blank them
Trump to sit there rudely ignoring everyone like a vile, petulant child. He will also spend most of his time tweeting rubbish like “US border control tell me they got dogs can sniff out RAPISTS!!! America comin for ya, Sanchez the rapist!!!”. 
5pm. Feeble attempt to laugh off protesters 
After a huge blimp with the words ‘DONALD IS A THICK FASCIST SCUMBAG AND SHIT AT BUSINESS, ACTUALLY’ on the side drifts over London, Trump claims he could “kick those guys’ asses”, despite being 72 and terrified of his hair falling off.
11pm. Romantic time with Melania
Finally a chance for the couple to relax and watch some TV in hotel rooms 150 metres apart.
Sunday
9am. Golf in Scotland
Harmless photo opportunity and quite jolly until Trump goes off on a tangent and threatens to nuke Belgium, for reasons known only unto himself.
12pm. Departure

"I don’t know how I did it either, by Gareth Southgate","TO BE honest, I’m just as confused as everyone else.
From journalists to fans, the first question people have asked me over the past two weeks is: “Gareth, how did you take a team with little international experience and turn them into genuine World Cup contenders?” To be honest, I haven’t got a fucking clue.
When it came to picking the squad I was lucky, because it pretty much picked itself. Kieran Trippier is very, very good at FIFA and he always plays as Yeovil. With that combination of skill and humility he was my first choice.
I chose Jordan Pickford because I used to have a poster of Jordan in my locker, and I chose Ruben Loftus-Cheek because I used to have a tortoise called Ruben Loftus-Cheek.
Also, and I don’t know if you’ve noticed, Harry Kane is very tall. I put him up front so he can get the ball when it’s higher. Harry Maguire is tall as well, so I put him down the back so he can get the ball when it’s higher but down the back.
I’ve just noticed that they’re both called Harry! Maybe it’s that?
Anyway, we’ve just got to concentrate on getting past Croatia and then it’s the World Cup final. If I find out how I got us this far, I’ll let you know.",NaN,9th July 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/southgate667-1.jpg,Fake

What totally regrettable thing will you be doing if England win… or lose?,"WITH a chance of going through to the World Cup final at stake, England vs. Sweden is going to be somewhat tense. So how will you be losing your shit over the outcome?
If England wins 
Offer to buy everyone in the pub a drink. Then remember there are bloody 300 people there precisely because it’s a crucial England game. Do the only sane thing and run off.
Get an England tattoo, ideally something deranged like the entire team drawn on your body. Then really hope they win the tournament because you’ve got Gareth Southgate’s frowning face peeking over your collar for the rest of your life.
As is traditional, strip off and run around naked. Note: Do NOT do this in places with a large number of nettles, barbed wire fences or ‘paedo hunter’ vigilantes.
Get drunker than you’ve ever been before. Have your enjoyment of the quarter-finals somewhat marred by drinking your lager through a straw. 
If England loses
Shamefully vent your anger on anything Swedish. Smash your copy of Abba’s Arrival then, in a fit of regret, mentally apologise to Agnetha, Anni-Frid, Benny and Bjorn.
Despite being a grown man, sob uncontrollably like a little girl who’s lost her dolly. Then remember everyone has a camera on their phone and it may not be the last time you hear of this.
If you’re part of the hooligan element, irrationally wreck whichever bar or pub you’re in. It’s entirely likely the fake Irish pub chain O’Neills helped Sweden cheat their way to victory.

True crime not for weirdos if it’s a podcast,"BEING obsessed with murderers is fine if you get the podcasts rather than the magazines, it has been confirmed.
’True crime’ had been considered the preserve of people who wear fingerless gloves and always have their curtains drawn, but it is now socially acceptable to be into real-life murder cases if you enjoy them in podcast form.
Julian Cook, host of the Boutique Vintage Murders podcast said: “We’re making stories about poisoning your wife tasteful.
“This isn’t titillating nonsense for those shut-ins who buy Britain’s Ten Most Deadly in paperback from a charity shop, or who subscribe to Gruesome Murder & Wordsearch Magazine.”
True crime aficionado Emma Bradford said: “I like Manchester City, house music, and hearing the stories of men who killed their neighbours with a claw hammer, as told by someone called Daryl who speaks very slowly.

“The roads are no place to learn to drive. If you can’t handle me being right up your arse in my company car, flashing my lights and making a slightly outdated ‘dickhead’ hand gesture, then just give it up and get a horse.”

What does your ice lolly say about you?,"YOUR choice of ice lolly reveals your personality on a deep and profound level.
As the heatwave continues, now is the time to visit your local corner shop for a frozen, phallic object on a stick. But your lolly choice is about much more than your preference for orangey things. It is a window onto your innermost being.
Feast/Mint Feast
Feasts are the workhouse of the lolly world – solid, dependable, could possibly pull a plough. But few realise the Feast was created by 12th-century mystics, for whom the soft not-quite-ice-cream exterior represented the physical body while the hard chocolate pellet inside is the eternal soul. Thus the Feast lover has hidden depths and may possess magical powers.
Calippo
Calippos are well-known for having the look and texture of a dog’s penis. The message for Calippo-lovers could not be clearer – stay away from attractive dogs.
Twister
Twisters actually glow in the dark, and were designed by the US army to provide emergency lighting in underground combat  situations. In America they are still known by their original name of ‘Tunnel Sticks’. Thus it is the ‘warrior’s lolly’.
Magnum (normal or limited edition)
You are a calculating psychopath who craves the social status that only a boutique cream snack costing three quid can confer. Your luxurious home is entirely covered with brown leather and during your spare time you like to writhe around with a massive snake making sex noises.
Mr Freeze ‘Ice Pops’
You are calm, tenacious, and quite prepared to gnaw at a highly resilient condom-like exterior, swallowing some plastic in the process, to achieve a fairly disappointing result.
Solero

He said: “The modern dating market is a jungle. A hot, steamy jungle full of women desperate for an oasis of cool.

"Are you drinking enough water? No, but take our test anyway","ARE you drinking enough water? Of course not. Doctors or fitness experts or whatever recommend you drink at least 18 litres of water a day. But why not take our test to confirm it? 
How much water do you realistically estimate you drink in a day?
A. About eight or nine litres. There doesn’t seem to be time to drink more.
B. Five cups of coffee, three cans of Sprite, and a bottle of wine.
Do you ever feel dehydrated?
A. No because I drink water constantly. I’m answering this between swigs.
B. Is that not what movie stars’ publicists say when they’re in rehab for drug addiction? I thought that was what it was. What, they just needed water?
What colour is your urine? 
A. Almost clear but not quite as crystal clear as precious, wonderful water, which proves I need to drink more water.
B. Urine-coloured.
How much do you spend each week on bottled water? 
A. Approximately 80 per cent of my income. I know, I know, it’s not enough, I still don’t have skin like the supermodels.
B. Like, the water you get from the taps at home?

"I lost my life savings for nothing more than being a naive, greedy bastard who fell for a get-rich-quick scheme","IT could never happen to me, people say. And unless you’re an avaricious knobhead so convinced of their superiority they believe they can double their money in six months, you’re right. 
But if you are, a word of warning. Because I was one of those people and somehow, between my naked greed and my howling stupidity, I lost everything I had.
Who wouldn’t, I ask you, respond to an anonymous email promising incredible returns on capital? Who wouldn’t assume they were the only one savvy enough to spot this amazing opportunity?
Only the smart and prudent would miss out on the chance to own a whole floor of a luxury, fictional apartment block for just £5,000, then another £30,000 in six months, then an unexpected extra £68,000 later.
Being stupid alone wouldn’t do it. And the just plain greedy often have a measure of cunning that rules them out. No, deals like this are reserved for people like me who are that winning combination of both.
And when, a year down the line, I discover that a deal that was too good to be true was, in fact, neither good nor true? I won’t blame myself.
Instead I will appear in your local newspaper standing self-righteously in front of the empty patch of land the apartments were never going to be built on, officiously saying my bank should give me the money back.

Diego Maradona’s guide to having friends over for ‘wine’,"HOLA! I’m footballing legend Diego Maradona and here is my guide to having a few friends round for a quiet evening with cheese, pleasant conversation and ‘wine’.
Step 1: Supplies
Make sure you have plenty of ‘wine’. Get the good shit, nothing that’s been mixed with anything. Put your ‘wine’ merchant’s number on speed dial. You don’t want to run out of ‘wine’. 
Step 2: Preparation
Loosen up with a couple of ‘glasses’ of ‘white wine’ before your guests arrive. Start getting out the cheese and biscuits but decide to do it later and have some more ‘wine’ instead. 
Step 3: Greet your guests  
Invite your guests in and get them some ‘wine’. Ask whether you should put a couple of pizzas in the oven. Don’t worry if no one is interested – they’re probably just saving room for the ‘wine’. 
Get an interesting conversation going – for example, everyone repeatedly saying, “Fuck, this is good ‘wine’!”
Step 4: Listen to deafening rock music
The best music for an evening of cheese and ‘wine’ is 1980s rock turned up to maximum volume. The power chords and macho posturing sound great after you’ve done lots of ‘wine’.
Step 5: Threaten your neighbours
At this point your neighbours may complain because you’ve been listening to Livin’ on a Prayer on repeat for several hours. Threaten them with a firearm and calm your frayed nerves with a large glass of ‘wine’.
Step 6: Deal with the police
By now your neighbours have probably called the police. Have another ‘glass of wine’ and barricade yourself inside the house.
Step 7: Tidying up 
There’s nothing worse than waking up to a mess after a gathering, so flush all your ‘wine’ down the toilet before the police smash the door in and turn your house upside down. 
And that is how to have a wonderful evening with nothing stronger than a glass of ‘wine’.",NaN,28th June 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/maradona-copy-2.jpg,Fake

The A-Level student’s guide to being a wanker all summer,"WITH A-Levels coming to an end, you’ve suddenly got loads of time on your hands for self-absorbed teenage crap! Here are some ideas for activities.
Form a shit band with terrible priorities 
Put together a band that doesn’t do basic things like writing songs or finding a singer. Instead spend hours designing your first album cover and discussing the coolest ‘amp’.
While you’re recruiting your mate Gav – who can only play the recorder – act as if you’re already U2. No one has ever found the music industry hard to break into.
Fall in love in a shallow way 
Meet that special someone who is your soulmate for life and has incredible depths to their personality. Talk about them a lot and do some secret poetry. Then have a proper conversation with them and realise they’re actually quite boring.
Relentlessly slag off where you live because you’re going to university
This is fair enough if you live on a grim South London estate or a backwater of Stoke where there’s nothing except a tyre shop and a pub that closed in 1993, but a tad self-indulgent elsewhere.
Contrary to popular teenage belief, places are not inherently shit because there isn’t a large nightclub, a venue capable of hosting the Foo Fighters or 24-hour drug dealing. You’re only going to Leicester anyway.
Make overconfident long-term plans
If you’re studying graphic design and Kelly is doing business studies, why not have your own business in New York once you graduate? You’re not sure where Rob will fit in because he’s doing chemistry, but you can easily subsidise him once you’ve made your first £10 billion.

How to work in the heatwave,"A GUIDE to surviving the heatwave whilst you are technically meant to be doing a job.
Council workman/Builder
It’s surely too hot to work, so just sit around, reading the paper and drinking cups of tea. Then if the boss shows up quickly jump up and look like you’ve been working the whole time. Basically the same as any other working day.
Office worker
They can’t be expecting you to give 100 per cent, not in this heat, surely. The toilet will be the best place to avoid work as you can just sit there watching old cartoons on your phone. When you finally return to the office, hold your stomach and mutter about some bad prawns.
Police officer
Who can be bothered chasing criminals in this kind of heat? Just sit in the police car, turn the air conditioning up and maybe eat a Mint Feast or Solero. If it’s too hot for you to work then it’s definitely too hot for criminals to work.
Heart surgeon
Even in normal-weather operations they have those people who dab your sweaty brow, so just imagine how much dabbing they’d have to do during a heatwave. Most heart operations probably aren’t that urgent anyway, and hospitals are full of beds so simply find an empty one and have a siesta.",NaN,26th June 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/hotweather67.jpg,Fake

Lineker finally admits he won Golden Boot in 1986,"BBC presenter Gary Lineker has finally solved the mystery of who won the Golden Boot at the 1986 World Cup.
The former England striker had remained tight lipped about the prize for the tournament’s top scorer, refusing to even say the words ‘Golden Boot’ at every available opportunity.
But he admitted: “It was me. I had hoped that everyone had forgotten. I have been so disciplined in not mentioning it repeatedly, every single day on live television for the past nine days.
“But after each match Alan Shearer and Frank Lampard have been saying to me ‘Gary, at no point have you talked about the Golden Boot, which is kind of odd, because you won it in 1986 by scoring a hat-trick against Poland, then another two against Paraguay and then your sixth goal in three games against Argentina in the quarter final’.”
He added: “I hate taking about winning the Golden Boot in 1986. I’d much rather talk about the 1990 World Cup, particularly the opening game against Ireland, because that’s when I shat myself.”",NaN,23rd June 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/lineker-667x375.jpg,Fake
Ex-boyfriend’s voicemail more emotionally supportive than he ever was,"A WOMAN calling her ex-boyfriend’s voicemail up to 18 times a day admits it is more understanding than he ever was. 
Emma Bradford of Deptford called ex Tom Logan at 2am last Saturday to air grievances about their relationship but ended up after 40 minutes of voicemail chat with a real sense of closure.
Since then she has taken to calling it with frequent updates about her lunch, her day at work, what TV she is watching and what that bitch Jeanette has done now, and believes the relationship between them is only getting stronger.
She said: “The first time I heard that reassuring voice saying ‘Hi, Tom here, please leave a message and I’ll call you back’ I knew finally I had someone I could really unburden myself to without being interrupted or talked over.
“Tom’s voicemail isn’t just pretending to listen while waiting to play FIFA. It’s not texting its mates while I’m unburdening about what my mother said. It’s patient, and it’s open, and it’s kind.
“It’s made me feel okay about the split, and encouraged me to feel like one day I’ll find a man who can come to the phone right now, and really will get back to me when he can.”

‘Sound of the summer’ is bastard neighbour’s hedge trimmer,"BRITAIN’S neighbours intend to trim their hedges relentlessly until Autumn, they have announced.
Annoying neighbours say the only sound people will be hearing for the entire summer is the loud grinding of trimmer blades as they obsessively hack away at hedges and shrubs.
Neighbour Roy Hobbs said: “I’ll be going at it like a madman all day, every day, all summer. You’d think I’d run out of things to trim, but I fucking won’t.

"I made £600 million from racist jokes in the 80s, says Lord Sugar","ALAN Sugar has defended an offensive tweet by saying nobody minded when he built a business empire selling racist jokes in the 1980s. 
The Apprentice star, criticised for tweeting an amusing observation about black people looking similar, said he made a fortune buying up racist jokes cheaply and selling them on at a profit.
Sir Alan said: “Racist jokes may seem outdated now but people couldn’t get enough of them back then. Everyone wanted one.
“I’d buy van-loads of them from comedians in Northern working men’s clubs then ship them down to London and flog them to the City boys at three times the price. I was making 80 grand a week.

How to make the World Cup tolerable if you f**king hate football,"ARE you totally uninterested in football but face weeks of men kicking a little a ball around and analysing it? Read our handy tips for making it less tedious.
Take a fuckload of drugs
The ideal World Cup drug is probably LSD. Even the dullest Iceland vs. Saudi Arabia clash won’t be boring if the TV remote grows a face and starts whispering to you.
Note: If you’re watching in the pub, it’s probably not a good idea to be so high you’re laughing hysterically as England inevitably gets knocked out in the quarter finals.
Make your own game of World Cup buzzword bingo
Make your own bingo card of grimly overused football phrases. Here are some to get you started:
● “Germany showing all the Teutonic efficiency that brought us the excellent Braun Oral B electric toothbrush.”
● “They’ll be dancing like wankers in the streets of [capital city] tonight.”
● “Write them off at your peril!” (Just before the struggling team concedes 15 goals and the captain shoots himself.)
Troll proper football fans
Offer absurdly fuckwitted analysis of what’s happening on the pitch, eg. “Six-nil is a mountain to climb for Morocco, especially with four minutes to go, but they said the Titanic wouldn’t float.” 
You may be surprised what you can get away with, and quite possibly be regarded as a ‘football intellectual’.
Buy some ‘smart’ glasses
Pretend to watch the football while actually watching something else on a pair of smart glasses. Hey presto! Spain vs. Iran or Chris Waddle’s interminable moaning about FIFA becomes something life-enriching like Toy Story 3.
Put massive bets on matches
Increase your interest by putting large bets on matches. You may not be interested in Peru vs. Australia, but you’ll be interested in losing £400.
To really be gripped increase the sums from merely irresponsible to financially insane, eg. remortgage your house and put £80,000 on England vs. Brazil. You’ll be the keenest England supporter in the country!",NaN,22nd June 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/watching-football-2.jpg,Fake
May jacking it in for job at Aldi,"BREXIT is such a massive fuck-up that Theresa May is quitting politics for a less stressful life working in Aldi.
After spending several weeks trying to stop MPs fighting over deals that will never exist, May is resigning to retrain as a store assistant at an Aldi in Bracknell.
May said: “As you might have noticed from my constant strained grimace and cack-handed bungling of everything I do, I’m finding Brexit to be a total fucking nightmare.
“Stacking shelves at Aldi doesn’t have the same glamour as being PM, but I think there’ll be more job satisfaction in neatly lining up packets of ‘So Malty’ malt loaf than shafting the UK and being hated by everyone forever.
“I’m also looking forward to being able to relax in the evening, rather than nervously refreshing the BBC News website in case Boris has told the Indian finance minister we’ve got the recipe for curry now.
“And of course I’ll get first dibs on all the treasures in the middle aisle. They’ve got inflatable kayaks this week, you know.”

Five books to pretend to read while thinking about how clever you look holding a book,"READING a book in a cafe, on the Tube or at the wheel of your car makes you look wise and mysterious, even if you’re just posing and not taking in a word. 
Here are five books to skim while feeling really smug about how clever other people must think you are. 
The Power by Naomi Alderman
This dark dystopian tale of a world where women are suddenly more physically powerful than men will completely pass you by as you glance up from it every five seconds to see who’s looking approvingly at your cutting-edge choice of contemporary literature. 
Animal Farm by George Orwell
Ideal for feigning knowledge of literature because hardly anyone has actually read it. The pigs are the bad guys and communism is a bit shit, is really all you need to know. Now you can get on with thinking about what you’re having for tea.
Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
You’ve seen the movie(s) or the TV adaptation(s), and the story’s the same as Bridget Jones’ Diary, so you can just let your eyes glaze over for this one and sporadically turn a page for effect. 
The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath 
Everybody wants to look like they’re emotionally stable enough to read The Bell Jar, so now’s your chance. Just make sure not to actually read it, it’s a real bummer.
Any Harry Potter with a fake sleeve by JK Rowling
On the off-chance you do actually want to read a book, you can’t go wrong with any of the Harry Potter books. Just pinch a Tolstoy dust jacket from Waterstones, stick it on The Goblet of Pixies or whatever and you’ll look like a proper intellectual.

“He clearly had meditation boner problems like me, because why is he always wearing loose robes and sitting down?

Man who thought he had World Cup fever actually has malaria,"A MAN who diagnosed himself as having ‘World Cup fever’ has actually got malaria, his doctors have confirmed.

How to pretend you know about football,"NOW is the time to pretend you’re into football, even though the only player you know is David Beckham. Here is your essential guide to being part of the national frenzy.  
The man with the whistle is the umpire. Like tennis, a really good sport, the umpire controls everything and can award a player with a yellow or red card if they think their hair is shit.
If someone asks you who you support you should not mention your standing order to The Red Cross.
The fight lasts for 90 minutes but extra time can be added if there isn’t enough waving from the audience. 
If England score grab a nearby man by the head, look into his eyes and say ‘Ooooo, Bill Beaumont-esque.’ Then kiss him on the lips.
On football history, you should know that women were banned at the Brazil World Cup for biting, much to everyone’s relief.

“I did also shout ‘THEY DON’T LIKE IT UP ‘EM!’ and put on the Dambusters theme, but that was just a coincidence.”

Man interested in open relationship can’t even cope with sharing his crisps,"A MAN who thinks it would be cool to have a ‘polyamorous’ relationship gets jealous and possessive when asked to share his crisps.
Office worker Nathan Muir has claimed monogamy is unnatural and he is evolutionarily hardwired to have sex with multiple women, despite only having slept with three of them in his life.
Muir’s partner Nikki Hollis said: “Nathan says he could handle me sleeping with other people, but when I asked for some of his pickled onion Monster Munch the other day he got really annoyed. 
“I don’t think he’s thought this polyamorous relationship thing through. He seems to think it just means he can shag around and that’s all there is to it.
“But considering how tetchy he gets about other people dipping into his Frazzles I don’t think he’d be able to cope with me having amazing sex in our bed with a string of serious or casual lovers.
“With a bit of luck he’s just having another phase, like when he got obsessed with Breaking Bad and wanted to retrain as a science teacher.”
Muir said: “Me and Nikki having lots of different sexual partners sounds really hot. Hey, did you just have one of my kettle chips? Fuck off, there’s only six left.”

"There is no non-wanky way to sign off an email, study finds","THERE is no way to end an email that does not make you sound like a bit of a twat, it has been confirmed. 
The Institute for Studies found all email sign-offs suffered from problems such as being weirdly matey, passive-aggressive or sternly formal like a threatening letter from a bank.
Professor Henry Brubaker said: “Does anyone actually know what ‘kind regards’ means? Also it sounds a bit drippy and outdated, as if you’ve somehow received an email from a Victorian aunt.
“An abrupt ‘thanks’ sounds sarcastic, or as we academics would describe it, ‘a bit pissy’. 
“Then there’s ‘Cheers’, which gives the impression you want to take the recipient down the pub for a blokey night out, when all you’re doing is sending a work email about some marketing toss. 
“Don’t get me started on sign-offs like ‘Yours sincerely’, which make you sound like an elderly gran who thinks all emails have to be written like a formal letter of condolence.

You won’t believe what actress X looks like now!
Except you will. They look like an actress who was in their 20s in the 1980s, but is now 35+ years older due to the linear nature of time. Disappointingly none of them has undergone a genuinely unbelievable transformation, such as becoming a cyborg.
Also because the actresses are invariably Jaclyn Smith from Charlie’s Angels and Erika Eleniak from Under Siege, you can just google them and save a lot of time while still being a sad bastard.
Quizzes you can’t fail 
‘Can you answer 40 questions about World War 2?’. Yes you can, because the questions tend to be: ‘Was Hitler: (A) German; (B) American; (C) Martian.’

In reality the only people talking about these games are probably the programmers, bitterly saying things like: “Man, I could have worked for Rockstar, but I’ve pissed my life away animating these crappy cartoon cows.” 
Local millionaires reveal their secrets!

Idyllic life on canal boat actually massive pain in the arse,"LIVING on a boat appears relaxed but actually involves things like emptying a big box of your own excrement on a regular basis, it has emerged.
Tom Logan and Francesca Johnson purchased a narrow boat six months ago to experience a ‘change of pace’, which they definitely have due to the vast amount of extra stress.
Graphic designer Logan said: “I wish I hadn’t wanked on about how tranquil it would be because I can’t sleep at night for worrying about buying a home that’s constantly rotting away slowly.
“We couldn’t get a mooring in a gated marina so we’re out on the canal bank. It sounds nice in theory but towpaths seem to attract every kind of nutjob from pissed-up vagrants to psycho bastard cyclists.
“The actual boat is a nightmare. Initially we thought everything being so small was quirky and cute, but have you ever tried to turn a dining table into a bed after you’ve had five glasses of Merlot?
“Also I think I may have started to develop claustrophobia.

The mum’s guide to keeping your children informed about tedious shit,"IT is a mother’s duty to keep your grown-up children informed about dull things that don’t affect them. But are you passing on enough tedious information? Take our quiz.
You see a programme on BBC2 about eskimos. What do you do next?
A. Nothing. 
B. Ask your son if he saw “the programme about eskimos” as if it was a major cultural event that gripped the nation. If he did not, explain eskimo life to him in enormous detail, including going to the toilet through an ‘ice hole’.
It is raining. What is your response?
A. Wait until it stops before going out.
B. Ring your children. They need to be made aware of this phenomenon known as ‘rain’.
A friend’s daughter is marrying a man who got divorced 10 years ago. What should you do? 
A. Be pleased for them.
B. Phone your daughter and speculate that the new husband – who you know nothing about – is probably not to be trusted, as if he is some sleazy womaniser with a gold medallion who possibly does a bit of pimping on the side.
How would you describe ‘email’?
A. A revolution in global communications technology.
B. A means of sending your children a constant stream of recipes that they “might be interested in”, eg. an insanely complicated cauliflower curry recipe because they have been known to eat cauliflower.
You see a TV news report about street crime in London. What is your response?
A. Just be glad it is a rare occurrence.
B. Remember your son went to a conference in London three years ago and ring immediately to warn him about the ‘acid gangs’. When he points out he lives in Norwich and has no plans to visit London assure him they’ll be coming to Norfolk soon. 
Mostly As. You are not giving your children nearly enough dreary information. Try giving them twice-daily updates on local roadworks and email them a picture if you buy a new cheese grater. 
Mostly Bs. You are an excellent mum! Now take it to the next level with utter tedium like their dad finding a completely unused paintbrush in the shed.

Why I would rather a man who was blackout drunk flew my plane than a woman,"by Wayne Hayes, opinion owner
YESTERDAY a British Airways pilot was disgracefully sent to jail just for being more than four times over the alcohol limits before a long-haul flight to Mauritius. 
But the health and safety Nazis have got it wrong again. Because I, like every passenger on that plane, would rather be flown by a male pilot so drunk he was slurring obscenities and punching out at thin air than by a woman.
Flying, like driving, is done mainly on muscle memory. A relaxing few doubles, and perhaps a quick fag while waiting for a clear runway, actually gives a male pilot the clear head he needs.
Lady pilots, on the other hand, are such perfectionists, demanding everything be done their way, that they fall apart and ground their planes at the slightest dodgy reading or fuel leak.
A male who’s had a few finds worries about weather, whining passengers and ‘pre-approved flight plans’ just melt away so he can get on with being the stick-and-rudder flyer he was born to be.
Women? Desperate to please. Every time they hear the ding of a passenger’s call light, their natural cabin crew instinct is to leap up and refresh their drink. They can barely remember they’re meant to be at the controls!
And when it comes to landing? Well. Ever see a woman try to reverse into a parking space? I’ll let you into a little secret: no female pilot has ever landed a plane. They ask their co-pilot to do it.
Meanwhile their male counterparts, as long as they’ve been kept topped up to stop dangerous hangovers kicking in, can barrel in blindfolded and still land their aircraft with pinpoint precision. It’s in the blood.
And before anyone calls this sexist, it isn’t. It’s just science.",NaN,13th June 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/whiskey-pilot-667x375.jpg,Fake

"The pros and, for the sake of completeness, cons of cannabis legalisation","LEGALISATION of cannabis would raise billions in tax, free up police resources and deprive criminal gangs of income. But let’s pretend there’s a bad side.
However, for the sake of ‘balance’, there are probably a few minor disadvantages if you look hard enough. Here’s a look at the pros and, supposedly, cons:
PRO: Cannabis is already used by four-and-a-half million otherwise law-abiding Britons without major negative effects on society.
CON: Cannabis is a ‘gateway’ drug, although so is Ibuprofen if you’re that way inclined.
PRO: Legalising and taxing cannabis would provide a major new source of income for ailing public services.
CON: EasyJet flights to Amsterdam would be hit hard, cancelling at least eight routes per week with possible redundancies.
PRO: Cannabis is a naturally-produced substance which can have significant medical benefits.
CON: Police would no longer have a ready-made reason to arrest young men who may then be found guilty of, or fitted up for, other crimes.
PRO: Cannabis is notably less physically harmful than alcohol and causes fewer fights outside kebab shops.
CON: Jamaican dub music is very bass-heavy and could disturb the neighbours.
PRO: Being stoned is fun.
CON: Those Reefer Madness films from the 1930s are terrifying.

Nikki Hollis, aged 19, of Topshop in Leamington Spa has almost complete control over which lines are stocked, which sizes are available and pricing so is the ideal person to approach with any issues.
She said: “I was scanning and folding a customer’s purchases when she upbraided me on our ‘unflattering’ summer lines and yes, she had definitely come to the right person on that.
“She also said that our Coventry branch had more choice, and that this one needed more people on the till as she’d been queueing for four minutes. Again, two issues well within my remit.
“My next customer tried to negotiate a discount on a T-shirt because of a make-up stain, and of course all part-time Topshop staff are expected to involve themselves in haggling. It’s just part of the job.
“Finally, I was told I should be ashamed that our white denim skirt wasn’t available in a size 20, and I agreed that I certainly should be as I was personally responsible for that decision. Received and understood.
“I’m going to have a lot to tell Sir Phillip Green about in our next meeting. Oh wait, that won’t happen because he doesn’t know who the fuck I am and doesn’t care.”",NaN,9th June 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/topshop-jumper-667x375.jpg,Fake
"You don’t need to secretly record me to hear me saying stupid shit, says Boris","BORIS Johnson has assured the public that he says ill-thought-out, inflammatory nonsense quite openly, so there is no need to secretly record him.

Johnson said: “Remember when I said that we’d get a good deal because of prosecco? I said that to the Italian government. Hard to believe, isn’t it?
“Or when I recited that racist poem in a Buddhist temple? Or told Libya it’d be a lovely place for a holiday once they cleared the corpses away?

Couple in late 30s weirdly not bothered about parents paying for everything,"A COUPLE who are supposedly proper adults do not seem troubled by being given loads of money by their parents, friends have noticed. 
Despite already getting massive financial help buying a flat and a car, Tom Logan and Nikki Hollis pathetically now expect their parents to chip in towards everything from holidays to their weekly shop.
Hollis said: “The cost of living is so high these days it’s entirely reasonable that our parents contribute towards those lovely shoes that caught my eye last week and Tom’s large collection of Playstation games.
“Yes, Tom and I both have jobs, but it’s not like the olden days when I could be a housewife and Tom could do an ordinary job like working in a factory and we could still buy a house and have loads of money.

Man with neck beard wondering what the hell he was thinking,"A MAN is having a major rethink of his neck beard after realising he has no idea why he grew it.
Administrator Martin Bishop began to have doubts about the beard – which is unconnected to other facial hair – after looking in the mirror and realising he had made himself look strange.
Bishop said: “Why did I grow this fucking neck beard? Does anyone know? I certainly don’t and I’m the one who grew it.
“It’s not really a hipster beard and it’s not a masculine beard like Action Man had. It just makes me look slightly like an internet troll or an Amish guy, which is a really odd look to go for.”
Bishop’s mum Sandra said: “He certainly does look like a twat.”
Bishop has theorised that he wanted a beard like many other men but also wanted to be ‘a bit different’, something he achieved by looking like an arse. 
He added: “I’m going to have to cut it off. I could grow more facial hair so it all joins up into a proper beard, but then I’d have several weeks of looking like I’ve got mange.” ",NaN,7th June 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/neckbeard.jpg,Fake

The Institute for Studies found that on closer examination the phrase suggested someone was grubby and unpleasant to look at most of the time.
Professor Henry Brubaker said: “On the surface it may seem like a compliment, but it’s actually what we lexicologists call a ‘bitchy backhanded smackdown’. 
“If we break down the words used, ‘scrub’ implies that the rest of the time you are disgusting and unwashed. In fact so filthy you can’t just bathe or shower, but need to actively ‘scrub’.
“Nor is it a compliment about your current appearance. You scrub up ‘nicely’. Not ‘beautifully’ or ‘wonderfully’, but ‘nicely’. 
“Nobody wants to be told they look ‘nice’. ‘It was nice’ is what you say to a friend who’s cooked you a meal when really you mean ‘bland and actually quite horrible’.”

David Davis to use SAS skills in Brexit disagreement,"DAVID Davis plans to halt publication of the government’s Brexit white paper by using his SAS experience to swing through a window on a rope. 
After a disagreement over customs plans, the Brexit minister and former Territorial SAS trooper will assault the final meeting about the document, ‘taking out’ cabinet colleagues if necessary.
Speaking from the roof of 10 Downing Street and wearing a balaclava, Davis said: “The time for talk is over. I’m a man of action, despite sometimes giving the impression of being half asleep. 
“At 11.10am exactly I’ll give myself the ‘go’ signal by closing my fist, then rappel down the building and smash through the glass feet-first.

The elderly parents’ guide to computers,"ARE you quite old and find computers baffling and terrifying? Don’t worry – our guide will tell you everything you need to know.
Getting started 
This is easy because your son or daughter will set up the computer for you. Remember to drive them to distraction with questions like, “What’s Video X Pro? Where do you put the batteries in? What if a spider gets inside?”
Once the computer is set up after considerable time and effort, show your gratitude by saying, “It all seems like a lot of fuss and bother. We’re not sure we really want one now.”
Other devices
Your computer is not somehow connected to all other electrical devices you own. It is perfectly safe to use the computer and have the TV on. There will still be enough electricity. It will also NOT interfere with your radio, turn the cooker on or agitate the cat.
Email
An ‘email account’ just means ‘your email’. It is not your bank account. You can tell this because your bank is called ‘the Natwest’ and not ‘Yahoo’, and Yahoo is not a bank. It’s that fucking simple.
Basic computing
There are really only three things you need to know about computers:
1. You can watch old films on YouTube and write to people using the aforementioned ’email’ without buying a stamp. Let’s face it, this is all you will be using it for.
2. You cannot ‘break’ computers by using them normally. This only happens if you do something phenomenally stupid like putting it in the dishwasher. Which you will.
3. Computers are not evil and do not watch you and report your activities to the government.
Staying safe online
Be sure to do the classic ‘older computer user’ thing of being utterly paranoid about giving your details to reputable companies like John Lewis, then completely forget about it when sent a clearly bogus email such as:
“FREE GARDEN CENTER PRODUCTS!!! Yes, you is lucky 1,000th persons chosen for FREE GRADEN CENTER PRODUCTS!!! Just send bank account details to [email protected] HURRY HURRY! Gnomes soon run out!!!”  
Troubleshooting
Similar to ‘Getting started’. Constantly phone your daughter in a panic insisting ‘hackers’ have taken over your computer but all you’ve done is open a new window and have no idea how to close it.",NaN,7th June 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/old-people-computer.jpg,Fake

Why are people not having sex with you?,"HAVE you started to think there might be a reason why no one is having sex with you? Take our test and find out.
What is on your bed?
A. John Lewis duvet in a tasteful, freshly-washed cover.
B. A Fraggle Rock duvet smelling strongly of sweat and covered in unmentionable stains that are hopefully not the bodily excretions they look like.
What, in your opinion, makes for a good conversation?
A. Listening to the other person and responding in a worthwhile way.
B. Banging on about some personal obsession – such as ethnic minorities being over-represented on TV – while the other person respectfully listens to your great wisdom.
What do you consider amusing?
A. Comedy films like The Lego Movie or some stupid but funny internet clip of monkeys stealing cigarettes.
B. Endlessly reciting Monty Python lines such as “It’s just a flesh wound!” and “Splitters!”
How is your flat furnished?
A. In a normal modern style with some Ikea stuff.
B. With hundreds of Doctor Who and The Last Jedi action figures – including the shit characters no one likes such as Cybershades and Rose Tico – which you talk about at length, like a creepy doll collector in a horror movie.
When you invite someone back to your place, what do you say to them?
A. “Would you like a glass of wine or a coffee?”
B. “Time to get out the banjo, methinks!”

How much pasta should you cook to make the sadness go away?,"COOKING the right amount of pasta is notoriously difficult. Take our simple quiz to find out how much to cook to make the sadness go away.
How sad do you feel?
A. I feel constantly sad. Nothing makes the sadness go away. I am hoping pasta might fill the void.
B. I’m not sad, I’m just cooking pasta.
How much pasta do you usually cook?
A. As much as I can fit into the pan without it all burning around the sides. Also if I’m completely honest, sometimes I don’t cook it and just crunch it straight out of the packet. It doesn’t taste good, but what else is there except pasta? So, all in all, quite a lot of pasta.

B. Usually a bit too much. I always end up with more than I need, but when that happens I save the rest for lunch the next day.

Do you really believe the sadness will go away if you eat enough pasta?
A. I feel if I eat enough pasta it will fill the gnawing emptiness at the core of my existence. I’ve tried loads of things but I’m certain pasta is the key to feeling less sad. Even if it’s just for a little while.
B. No. Look, I’m not trying to make the sadness go away. I’m just making dinner.
Mostly As: Keep cooking as much pasta as you can. It is a well-known comfort food and will therefore fill the void in your life. You just need to eat enough of it. Bon appetit.

City lawyer Nathan Muir invites friends over mainly to demonstrate his superior wealth, but also to laugh at their ignorance of how much luxury items cost.
Muir said: “There’s nothing better than a relaxed evening with a few friends who are blown away by my amazingness when they find out my stereo cost £11,000. 
“I like to invite them over for drinks then badger them with questions like, ‘Did you catch the Audi in the driveway? How much d’you think that bad boy set me back? Go on, guess. Guess! GUESS!’
“When they can’t work out it’s a 70k top-of-the-range model I’ll hit them with some playful banter like, ‘Wrong! But what did I expect from a pov with a second-hand Golf?’”
Friend Tom Booker said: “To be honest most of us only go over so we can do impressions in the pub of Nathan wanking on about his casserole dish that cost £3,500.”",NaN,31st May 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/luxury-home-2.jpg,Fake
Woman using mindfulness time to plot revenge,"A WOMAN is getting the most out of her daily mindfulness session by planning how to fuck up people who have wronged her.

How are you being a twat in the supermarket?,"WE all love going to the supermarket, but are you doing all you can to annoy other shoppers? Read our guide and find out.
Take a stupidly long time choosing mundane items 
While obstructing other shoppers, take fucking ages to make up your mind, as if buying some milk is a decision on a par with abandoning your family to become a professional circus clown.
Show off your bad parenting
Other shoppers love wondering if they should call social services when someone’s screaming “JAYDEN! Stop being a BLOODY little BASTARD!” and looking as if they’re about to lamp a six-year-old boy with a tin of baked beans. 
Show off your ridiculously middle-class parenting
Turn every purchase into a dreary educational talk, eg. “Where are the strawberries from, Luke? That’s right – Kenya! And which continent is that? It’s Africa! And what are continents on? Tectonic plates!”. Remember to speak loudly and poshly.
Be a voucher obsessive
Hoard every type of voucher, especially ones that offer pointlessly small discounts such as 10p off a bottle of gin. Then take a huge number with you and bring the till to a standstill as you try to redeem 50 Horlicks vouchers that expired in 2007.
If teenage, act like you’ve never been in a sodding shop before
If you are part of a group of teenagers, behave as though Asda is a thrilling adventure crammed with unbelievable surprises. For example: “Ohmigod, do people, like, actually BUY fish with their heads on??? Gross!”
At the till, send your child to get forgotten items

Property developer slides down large snake to end up back at home with his parents,"A MAN who nearly reached the top of the London property ladder is back at his parents’ after sliding down an enormous snake.

“I bought a load of flats, kicked out the tenants and tarted them up for rich twats. But then this big snake appeared and instead of eating me, I slid right down it and wound back sleeping in my folks’ spare room.”
Bishop did a series of dodgy property deals with men who looked like extras from a Danny Dyer film, which he is also now blaming on the snake.

An England insider said: “Harry’s not living in some fantasy land of guns and gangsters and fluke victories over Tunisia, unlike certain City strikers I could name.
“He’s thought ahead and got himself inked with a really moving image of a gravestone surrounded by the ghostly heads of the squad ready for those slow-motion shots of his sweaty torso as we exit the competition, probably over an Adele song.

“I kept frantically scanning the fields and saw a building I was sure was a pub, but as we got closer it was clearly just a cow shed. It’s amazing what fear can do to your mind.”
Logan’s alcohol-free nightmare continued for a further two hours, during which he was forced to feign interest in a tor.

The supermarket has acknowledged that putting ‘best before’ on the tomatoes, courgettes and apples it sells implies their palatability is affected by time, when in fact they are entirely tasteless before, on and following the given date. 
A spokesman said: “These apples? The only honest ‘best before’ date would say ‘best before the advent of factory farming and the growing of fruit based on appearance, not flavour’. 
“Now our customers, instead of blaming themselves for their tardiness, can rest assured that the fruit they buy is never any good to eat and enjoy a nice bag of Monster Munch instead.”",NaN,22nd May 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sandwich667.jpg,Fake
All modern friendships based on liking same telly programme,"MODERN friendships are based on overlapping tastes in TV, experts have confirmed.
Researchers have found that binge-able shows like The Crown and Stranger Things now function as essential bonding tools rather than entertainment.
Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies, said: “In previous generations, friendship was based on affection, a sense of affinity or physical proximity because you worked in the same mine.
“Nowadays, however, alliances are built around asking which TV shows  a potential friend is watching, and excitedly recounting the plots of key episodes together.”
His studies found that refusal to watch televisual modern classics like The Wire could limit a person’s friendship pool by up to 80 per cent, while staying abreast of hot-topic series’ such as The Handmaid’s Tale enabled people with terrible personalities to form connections.
Not having an opinion on the Great British Bake Off, meanwhile, was described by Brubaker as “nothing short of social suicide”.
Brubaker added that early indications from his latest research suggested that sharing pornography preferences was less effective in developing friendships.",NaN,22nd May 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/friends667.jpg,Fake

"It’s my wedding today too, and I’ll spend the entire day pretending I’m not f**ked off","By Carolyn Ryan
THREE years ago, I decided on my wedding date and booked the venue. Two-and-a-half years ago, I paid a deposit to a photographer. It’s a full year since I bought my dress. 
But thanks to the spontaneous decision of some tuppenny ha’penny TV actress and a wastrel who happens to be sixth in line to the throne, I will spend the best day of my life hiding the fact that I’m incredibly pissed off. 
When they announced it at the end of November, I comforted myself by telling everyone she must be pregnant. “Six months between engagement and ceremony? That tart’s up the duff for sure,” I confidently claimed. But sadly no. 
It’s the lack of consideration. They could have got married on a Friday, like most couple who can’t organise properly do. Given everyone a day off. But they had to be selfish. 
Even my family drama’s been overshadowed. Who cares that my mum’s regular hairdresser’s off with hives when Meghan’s dad’s a no-show? Drama queen. 
I arranged my wedding nice and early so I haven’t got uncles listening to the FA Cup final, and instead I’ve got their wives asking if there can be a telly at the reception so they can watch ‘the big day’. Bitches, you’re at the big day. That’s just a sideshow. 
But I know it’ll be obvious. I’ll walk down the aisle comparing her dress to mine. I’ll snap out ‘I do’ while wondering if they’ve written their own stupid Hollywood vows. On every photograph I’ll be glowering. 
She did this deliberately, the Yank tart. Well, I’m going to make my marriage last longer than hers out of spite. That’ll show her. ",NaN,19th May 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/annoyed-bride-667x375.jpg,Fake
"Saturday, May 19th 2018: A day to clean the fridge","ACROSS the country, British people are readying themselves for a once-in-a-lifetime fridge-cleaning moment.
There are few occasions in an everyday working person’s existence when they seriously consider getting all the shit out of the fridge, putting the really rank stuff into a plastic bag, and then giving it a really thorough wipe down with a bottle of squirty cleaner.
Perhaps even removing the particularly scuzzy see-through drawers, and leaving them to soak in the sink.
For most of us, simply ordinary folk whose lives are seldom touched by mouldy onions and multiple jars of out-of-date curry paste, the days when doing all this seems appealing are very few, and so very far between.
But Saturday is one of those days.
It is a moment in history when a nation united by a lack of normal television will stand up, chests inflated with pride, and say ‘I might as well have a go at the fridge’.
Stephen Malley, just an ordinary honest, working family man from Peterborough, said: “I never thought of fridge cleaning as something that was relevant to my life but there’s something unique and very special about this Saturday that has spoken to me on a very human level and made me go and buy some scourers.”
He added: “I will remove items including the mozzarella ball I bought nine months ago with the vague aspiration of making a nice salad, the old leeks that are starting to decompose, and the tub of Utterly Butterly that for some reason no one has ever thrown away despite it very evidently being empty.
“I will do this, and then I will use hot water and chemicals to make the inside of the fridge good again.

I’m spending the best-looking years of my life covered in a ridiculous beard,"I AM young. My skin, glowing with health, will never again look as good as it does now. In years to come, looking through photographs, I will be amazed at how handsome I was. 
But for some reason I have made the decision to spend these years – my entire 20s – with my face hidden behind a massive, stupid, fucking beard. 
Seriously, look at the size of this thing. If I were a fugitive from justice who’d spent six years living in the woods, it would be perfectly suited to conceal my identity from the law. 
I am no fugitive, but a man in his prime who has chosen to wear the facial hair of the Baader-Meinhof gang (2018 Ibiza club re-edit) simply because everyone else is doing it. 
And then of course there’s these glasses. There is no trace of darkness under my twinkling, youthful eyes. No creases mark their corners when I smile. But you’d never know that because of these ridiculous, thick-framed spectacles. 
It almost looks like I could remove the whole lot as one piece,, like Darth Vader’s mask but revealing not a scarred monster but a man in the springtime of his life. I could remove it all. But I don’t. 
Instead, when I show my children photographs of myself in years to come they will ask ‘Daddy, why did you spend your 20s cosplaying as Rasputin?’ And I will have no good answer.",NaN,14th May 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/young-hipster-667x375.jpg,Fake

Fray Bentos to change pie tin but keep contents disgusting,"THE makers of Fray Bentos pies have reassured fans that although the tins are changing, the contents will remain vile.
A Fray Bentos spokesman said: “Although we are altering our iconic tins to make them easier to open, the gruesome meat slurry and claggy pastry topping will stay exactly the same.

Fray Bentos fan Stephen Malley said: “If they made these pies less rank, it would not be such a badge of honour to be able to eat a whole one.

Being a virgin at 28 is nothing to do with my incredibly strange personality,"By Martin Bishop
I’M one of a growing number of young people who are choosing not to have sex, and it’s nothing to do with my strange personality or worrying religious beliefs.
We live in a hyper-sexualised world where sex is a commodity, not a special, beautiful thing between a man and a shy, pure woman untainted by other penises.
When you meet me you’ll find I’m a normal guy with a decent job in IT, although you’ll soon start to notice my off-kilter social skills, such as talking about Land Rovers for 20 minutes when you’re clearly not interested.
You’ll also wonder why I keep mentioning ‘spirituality’. Soon I’ll reveal I’m a full-on Christian, the sort who volunteers for a youth group where we teach children demons are real.
I’m only a virgin because I’m waiting for the right woman. She’s got to be beautiful, intelligent, kind and wise, like Emma Watson crossed with my gran. That sounds unrealistic, but it’s okay if she’s not intelligent.
Being a virgin also has nothing to do with my hobby of egg collecting. If I was a hot girl I’d be fascinated by hundreds of old, lifeless eggs arranged obsessively in cabinets.
I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t considered losing my virginity by picking up someone in a club. But the drink prices play havoc with my strict personal budget and a lot of women have diseases these days.
So as you can see, being a virgin is a lifestyle choice and perfectly normal, although sometimes I have to go to the doctor’s with ‘wanking injuries’.",NaN,14th May 2018,NaN,NaN,https://www.thedailymash.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/virg667.jpg,Fake
Builders actually intellectual ponces when you’re not around,"BUILDERS’ blokey behaviour is put on to disguise their pretentious cultural interests, it has emerged.

Brickie Roy Hobbs said: “People expect certain behaviour from builders, so for the sake of business we tend to be a bit shouty and laddish.
“But when homeowners aren’t around we enjoy erudite badinage about the subjects that truly make our hearts sing, such as the new Verdi at the Royal Opera House. 
“I hear that to miss Richard Eyre’s La Traviata would be simply criminal.

“Or maybe you want to increase profits by making pizza with rubbish ingredients like mouldy cheese and Spam. Just make a calzone. What you can’t see won’t hurt you, apart from the food poisoning.

Headmaster Professor Albus Dumbledore said: “I’ve earmarked a couple of million for a new Quidditch pitch, which we don’t technically need because they float above it on broomsticks but it looks nice. 
“We also have our own personal train and invisible platform at King’s Cross to maintain, neither of which muggles are allowed to see or even know exist but it’s only fair taxpayers stump up for them.
“A flagship school like ours encourages aspiration in ordinary children, who won’t ever be admitted because they can’t do magic. I’m afraid that’s just policy.

How many office bastards can you spot?,"THE modern office is a rich environment for twats of all shapes and sizes. But which ones do you work with? Read our guide and tick off all the ones you see!
The obstructive wanker
This office worker seems to think their job description is ‘make everything a pain in the arse’. They will resist even the most minor requests, as if you’ve asked for a bucket of diamonds rather than a pack of Post-its.
Boss who creates a miserable atmosphere
The sort of boss who, through their bad temper or obsession with productivity, turns the office into a no-fun, heads-down workhouse where no one talks to each other. 
The atmosphere immediately improves when they’re gone, much like the demise of the Wicked Witch of the East in The Wizard of Oz. Sadly they’re just at lunch and haven’t been killed by a house.
Permanently aggrieved woman
This colleague is ALWAYS having a bitter dispute with co-workers or the company and wants to tell you about it. (Note: They have no interest in you, except as a human bin in which to dump their woes.)
To make matters worse the dispute is usually totally incomprehensible, eg. “So Astrid’s got time off in lieu – no surprise there, Little Miss Two-Faced Bitch – and guess who’s got to do the Stevenage rotas?”  
The workplace pervert 
Always a man, this employee will expect other male co-workers to be interested in whatever hellish pornography he’s into, eg. “I found this cracking porno, mate. Have you seen Donkey Wanktuary?”
Working late martyrs 
“Looks like I’m working late again!” these employees will sigh, but secretly they’re enjoying their martyrdom or trying to suck up to the boss. If you study them closely you will notice their ‘late working’ is 90% making coffee and sending personal emails.
Mr Smooth

WHILST it seems to be pretty much mandatory for women to watch this programme about other women suffering, I’d rather smash the patriarchy by enjoying myself.
Some of my friends say I ‘must watch it, given the current socio-political climate’, as if by not watching I’m basically saying I think Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein are great guys who have just been a bit misunderstood.
When I approach a leisurely pastime, such as sitting down to watch a TV show, I want to enjoy it, rather than peeping out from behind a cushion hoping for a moment when something utterly hideous isn’t happening.
I wouldn’t do it for the Saw films, and I’m not about to start just because something has got Margaret Atwood’s name in the credits, even if she is really cool and looks how I imagine hipsters would like to look when they finally grow up.
Clearly terrible things happen to women all over the world, which is why I don’t want to watch it depicted on screen but with stylishly dystopian costumes and bafflingly lengthy shots of Elisabeth Moss looking scared.

Child who wanted pet given fish instead,"A FOUR-YEAR-OLD who wanted a pet has been bought a goldfish as a stop-gap measure. 
Tom Logan had pestered his parents for months before being fobbed off with the fish, which is like a real pet but guaranteed not to last as long. 
Father Simon Logan said: “He’s four. I’m not spending the next two years looking after a rabbit he got bored of in the first two weeks. 
“This way he gets to see what it’s like to have a pet, sort of, and we don’t have to worry about it escaping or biting or any of that. It’s like a trial period. 
“If he stays interested in it for a few months – presuming we’re still with the original fish by that stage, which is unlikely – then we’ll get a rabbit or whatever. 
“But chances are about the fourth time we find it floating in the tank he won’t even notice it’s gone, I’ll stick the empty tank in the garage.”
He added: “He’s called it Fishy Fishy Twillywoo. That pretty much proves my point.” ",NaN,6th May 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake
Beautiful pair of high heels to be stuffed in handbag by 8.30pm,"A STUNNING pair of designer heels will be too unbearable to wear an hour into a night out, their owner has confirmed. 
The handmade point-toe six-inch stilettos, which cost so much that Nikki Hollis has had to switch the cat to dry food only, are exquisite and entirely unsuited to being worn on the feet. 
Hollis said: “They’re so pretty. I feel like Cinderella. Don’t look at the way my toes are bent over each other. I can’t feel all of them.
“Honestly they’re so comfy – as long as I don’t try to stand up at any point and remember to reapply my blister plaster. But that’s fine, loads of people come to nightclubs for a lovely sit.”
Hollis removed the shoes after her second drink, claiming they were ‘too special’ to risk wearing out and she ‘didn’t want to ruin them.’

Roy Hobbs removed at least 50 items including garden tools and old paint tins before replacing them exactly as before with the air of someone carrying out a vital task.
Wife Sandra said: “I thought maybe Roy was chucking some stuff out but he just put everything on the lawn, looked at it, then started putting it back. I am completely baffled.
“It was almost like a military inspection. Maybe he was imagining he was a general and the lawnmower and old jam jars were his tanks and troops. I’m not sure. It’s too fucking strange. 
“What confused me is that a lot of the stuff – a deflated space hopper, for example – was clearly junk that could have been chucked. But no, back it went, into special ‘space hopper corner’.
“When he came in he looked as if he’d really achieved something. But what? I think it’s some sort of secret man ritual. Maybe they secretly worship some ‘god of sheds’. That would not surprise me.” 
Roy Hobbs said: “Of course it was a useful exercise. Now I know where the broken vacuum cleaner is if I need it.”

Tories annoyed Brexit not leaving time to bollocks up other things,"TORIES are concerned the government is so bogged down in Brexit it does not have time to destroy the rest of the fabric of society.
With Theresa May facing daily Brexit problems and top talents like David Davis constantly being called away to Brussels, many MPs feel they are neglecting other problems they could be causing.
Tory MP Denys Finch Hatton said: “Brexit is taking up valuable time that could be spent on weird policies there is absolutely no public demand for.
“We could be privatising food banks. We could get Wonga to run them. Then you could get another loan while you’re collecting your free food. That makes perfect sense to me.
“Then there’s guide dogs. It really is time we made these hounds profitable. I’d like to see strict targets for helping blind people across the road, with underperforming dogs being put down.
“Yes, we just introduced voter ID and ballsed it up, but we could have done so much more. Voters should have had to sing three verses of the national anthem before being allowed to vote.

He said: “You can just picture her. She’d have glasses and that. The sexy librarian look. She’d go, ‘I’m Cambridge. Have you been naughty and brought your books back late?’
“Whereas no self-respecting adult film actor would call themselves Stormy Daniels. It’s really 80s and it makes you think of Paul Daniels. That’s the last thing you want if you’re a porn star.

Where’s that twat Cameron these days? asks entire UK,"THE deepening Brexit crisis has made Britons wonder what has become of the pink-faced Etonian who caused it in the first place.
With negotiations in chaos and Britain’s economy predicted to nosedive to roughly Albanian levels, the public had expected to hear a little more about it from the former PM.
Office worker Martin Bishop said: “I would like to think Mr Cameron is slumped in the study of his country retreat, gaunt with remorse and shrunk to five stone in weight.

“However I have a much stronger suspicion he is sitting on a beach playing Fruit Ninja.”

The manipulative bastard’s guide to putting people on the spot,"ARE you always asking people for hugely annoying favours like driving you to Heathrow at 3am or helping you move your incredibly heavy furniture to a new flat? 
If so, you’ve probably noticed they sometimes try to get out of it. Here’s how to put them on the spot and make them do exactly what you want. 
Pile on the guilt
Reel off a list of any recent upsets or personal tragedies. Maybe your uncle died, or your goldfish. Be as pathetic as possible. 
Also remind them of any favours you’ve done them, even if they’re in no way comparable, eg. “Yes, I know it’s a pain putting up my weird friend I met in a chat room for 10 days, but I did once lend you an umbrella.” 
Ailments are also good. What kind of monster would say ‘no’ to you after you’ve just gone on blood pressure tablets? That’s practically murder. 
Ask in front of people
Make sure there’s an audience to put pressure on the other person to look kind and decent, even if your request is pretty fucking unreasonable.
If asking them online, copy others into your message or mention it on their Facebook wall. In real life bring a small child who will burst into tears if they say no. (If you don’t have any children just borrow one and bribe them with cheap chocolate.)
This will immediately ensure they do things like look after your cat at short notice while you have a bargain week in Spain.
Do your research
If you’re hassling someone to do something on a specific date, scope out their schedule in advance. You can do this by checking Facebook, asking their loved ones or hacking into their Google calendar. 
If, for example, you want a friend to be basically an unpaid slave at a party you’re organising, make sure they have no prior commitments preventing them from dealing with sausage rolls while you gaily socialise.
That way if they try to fob you off by saying they’re busy you can safely call them out for being a devious, conniving bastard.",NaN,3rd May 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake
Energy drinks maker launches ‘Hyper Anxiety’ flavour,"A COMPANY has launched an ‘anxiety flavoured’ energy drink for people who want the taste of how they feel.
MegaBoost UK Ltd created the groundbreaking drink by combining a huge hit of caffeine and sugar with jarring flavours including chilli, metal and stale urine. 
Managing director Tom Booker said: “The taste alone will have you buzzing with tension even before the ingredients have started wreaking havoc on your internal organs.
“The incredible taste of Hyper Anxiety comes from combining flavours no sane person would want in their mouth together, such as copper, cheese, caustic soda and dandelions.
“We’ve increased the caffeine and sugar to ensure every can is a sickly chemical syrup that tastes of nothing natural – which is exactly how our customers like it.”
Energy drink fan Wayne Hayes said: “One sip sends you into a panic, then when the caffeine kicks in you just want to run and never stop running like you’re being chased by demons. 
“I’m definitely switching brands from Red Bull.”

Your guide to voting in the local elections,"TODAY millions of Britons are proudly exercising their hard-won democratic right to vote in the local elections, or more probably staying in with a ready meal and Police Interceptors. 
So if you’re diligently trogging round to your old primary school to vote, what should you do? Read our guide.
Don’t vote on totally irrelevant issues
Try to base your vote on local issues, or at least actual UK politics. Don’t give Labour councillors in Crewe a kicking because you’re angry about Iraq. It’s unlikely Blair got them to fire the cruise missiles.
Do not vote for tiresome joke candidates
All elections throw up a small number of deeply unfunny ‘joke’ candidates, eg. ‘King Roddy Noddy Ploddy and the League of Tall Diddymen’. For Christ’s sake don’t encourage them.
Avoid the single issue nutters
Madster parties like the BNP tend to produce crap councillors who don’t turn up to meetings. Although if you’re anticipating a global race war masterminded by the Jews it’s easy to see that you might de-prioritise wheelie bin collections.
Be nice to polling station workers 
Most are volunteers working late for free, so be courteous to them. This includes not sharing your bizarre conspiracy theory that they secretly dump all the ballot papers ‘for the government’.
Take an interest in the regional mayoral elections
Actually this is a bit of a stretch for anyone. Just vote for the candidate with the best name.
If you can’t be arsed to vote, don’t claim it’s some sort of protest
If you can’t be bothered, don’t claim you’re “disenfranchised from the political process” or similar. Being a bit hacked off with politics and staying in to watch Eastenders doesn’t make you Steve Biko.",NaN,3rd May 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake

90% of woman’s workout is taking gym selfies,"THE majority of a woman’s workout is lifting her iPhone in order to take pictures of herself working out.

Office worker Hollis said: “It takes ages to get a flattering angle. On average I have to lift my phone up about 50 times per selfie session. 
“If you think of my iPhone as a weight, that’s at least 50 reps, which is actually a pretty intense bicep workout. Unfortunately by the time I’ve finished getting a good shot there’s rarely time to exercise the rest of my body. 
“It’s a bit disappointing to spend so much time at the gym and still feel so unfit. I’d take up jogging as well but the selfies always come out really blurred and unflattering.

How are you avoiding getting a round in?,"NOT getting rounds in means you can enjoy all the fun of the pub with none of the expense. So what are the best ways to avoid putting your hand in your pocket? Read our guide. 
Go to the toilet when it’s your round
Unfortunately this technique is well-known, so you’ll need an excuse. Say you’ve got a very weak bladder and frequently wet yourself, your bed and public transport. The chances of pulling anyone you fancy will now be zero, but saving £12.50 is what counts.
Claim a loved one has died
As your round approaches, check your phone and exclaim, ‘Oh no! Uncle Peter’s dead!’. No one will expect you to buy drinks and you can ask for expensive brandies to help you get over the ‘shock’.
Find weird distractions
Suddenly find something of extreme interest elsewhere in the pub, eg. historical prints. Say you’ve always been ‘fascinated’ by bottle kilns, even if this makes you the strangest 25-year-old on the planet.
Say you were mugged in the toilets
Claim someone pulled a knife on you and took your cards and cash. When your companions insist on telling the bar staff and calling 999, cynically say, “What’s the point? The police don’t do anything these days.”
Switch to soft drinks
After a few rounds, switch to soft drinks. No one will expect you to get a big round in if you’re drinking orange squash. Then be a devious bastard and switch back to alcoholic drinks whenever someone else is paying, saying, “I suppose one more beer wouldn’t hurt.”
Text in a bomb scare to the pub
Deeply irresponsible but will definitely get you out of buying a round. Strong possibility of a custodial sentence but everything in prison is free which will really save you some money.",NaN,26th April 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake

STAR-LORD (Chris Pratt): Literally just a dude, which was fine when he was co-starring with aliens in his own movie but makes him entirely redundant here. Watch as he repeatedly excuses himself from battles to mess around on his phone.
BLACK PANTHER (Chadwick Boseman): One of only three black characters, Black Panther is the one who isn’t a sidekick.
BLACK WIDOW (Scarlett Johansson): Major movie star and sex symbol Scarlett Johansson has a recurring minor role just so these films don’t seem completely like teenage boys’ homoerotic fantasies. Which they are, and she knows it, and so do you.
THANOS (Josh Brolin): The bad guy of these films will be unfamiliar to anyone who skips the post-credits scenes of Marvel movies. If you know him, congratulations for finally reaping the reward of watching text you’re not interested in. For an hour.
BATMAN (Ben Affleck): Batman is from a different universe and should not be in this movie, but he turned up on set in like the full outfit and it was totes awkward and nobody could quite tell him and so he just ended up in it. Embarrassing.
THOR (Chris Hemsworth): All the other gods totally look down on Thor for being in these films. It’s like reality TV to them. Hercules does this hilarious impression of him.

How to build your baby bullshit bunker,"THE Daily Mash presents a step-by-step guide to hiding out until the madness has passed.
The latest royal baby has arrived and you must act quickly to safeguard your family’s sanity as the ensuing bullshit turns millions of ordinary people into maniacs.
Here’s how to construct a simple, media-proof baby bullshit bunker: 
Dig up your garden to a depth of 8ft and line the pit with sandbags. These should keep out any TV, radio or internet signals which all contain high levels of baby bullshit.
Cover the top of the pit with decking, which will make it look like a normal garden and deter any Sky reporters from visiting to ‘get your reaction’ to the birth.
Grab tinned food, bottled water and a firearm. Get into the bunker as quickly as possible, otherwise neighbours may force you to attend a celebratory tea party.
Friends or relatives may appear, desperately demanding entry to your shelter and perhaps trying to claw their way in. But it’s too late for them, they are already contaminated and are thinking about nothing except whether the baby will be called Edward or Albert. Use deadly force if necessary.
The hardest part is knowing when to emerge. Lift the decking just enough to see out and look for warning signs like bunting, commemorative floral displays and people wearing Union Jack suits with giant papier-mache baby heads.",NaN,23rd April 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake

Gazidis said: “In his nine years in charge here, Arsene has proved himself to be the greatest manager in our club’s history. He leaves us in a strong position, with a world-class squad full of legends like Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieria, and exciting youngsters like Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie.

At primary school your child does not come top in a spelling test. What do you do?
A: Nothing.
B: Go to the school and demand the tests are re-marked, then get a posh private English tutor so that people stare at your child like a freak because they keep using words like ‘absquatulate’.
You go on holiday in rural Italy. What does your eight-year-old do?
A: Explore the countryside in a carefree way.
B: Complete a punishing regime of ‘worksheets’ you created about local flora and fauna that are harder work than studying for a botany degree at Imperial College.
Your child produces a cack-handed drawing of stick men killing each other. What is your response?
A: Put it on the fridge.
B: Demand your GP refers them to a child psychologist because of some bollocks article about sociopaths you read in the Observer.
Your partner treats the kids to a KFC bucket. How do you react?
A: It’s no problem – fast food is fine as an occasional treat.
B: Histrionically snatch the bucket off them as if they’re about to tuck into razor blades dipped in strychnine and throw it in the bin, then make a platter of your own ‘fast food’ consisting of raw mushrooms with low-fat yoghurt dip.
What are your children reading at the moment?
A: Harry Potter or ‘young adult’ fiction.
B: They are being forced to read a load of classics you bought them, such as Treasure Island and Prisoner of Zenda, even though you tried reading them yourself but were bored shitless and watched Wonder Woman instead.
What is your worst fear for your children?
A: An accident or serious illness.
B: They will marry someone who drives a van for a living.

Pissing around on the internet protects the sanity of every office worker. You do not want this job if you can’t spend at least half the working day shopping on Amazon, playing World of Tanks and sending clown porn to your friends.
“What sort of cool stuff will I be able to steal?”
Is there a lock on the stationery cupboard? Can I help myself to loo roll? If so, how much? A roll here and there, or enough for the rest of my life? If I happen to find an iPad lying around can I give it to my boyfriend for his birthday?
“How soon can I have a pay rise?”
Short-sighted employers might think this shows you don’t give a shit about the job, but actually it proves you are highly ambitious with aspirations to be a high-earner. If it’s more than six months, tell them to fuck off.

Man still knows where all the rooms are in Jet Set Willy,"A 47-YEAR-OLD man can still tell you exactly how the whole of Jet Set Willy’s mansion was laid out, including short-cuts. 
Nathan Muir has amazed friends and fellow drinkers by asking them to name any room on the ZX Spectrum 48k classic and instantly telling them how to get there.
He said: “The Yacht? Down to the kitchens, out the back door, past the tool shed, across the beach, boom. Watch out for that one arrow.
“Watch Tower? Get to the roof, climb the rope on We Must Perform A Quirkafleeg. Go up from there, you’re at The Off Licence. From the highest point to the furthest east, one jump.
“It’s all still there, rotating around in my head, every room, every item, every inch of that marvellous multi-coloured blocky mansion. Even when I’ve forgotten my own name I reckon I’ll still know how to get that tricky item in The Orangery.

"No need to wash your hands if it’s only a piss, agrees Britain"," 
BRITAIN has agreed that if it is just a piss then washing your hands is not a big deal.
The bourgeois affectation looks set to finally disappear, along with men holding doors open for ladies, putting napkins in little napkin rings and pretending to like other people’s children.
The news has been welcomed across the country.
Nikki Hollis, from Peterborough, said: “I’m an incredibly busy person and I have to manage my time carefully. Washing my hands after a piss seems very 20th Century.
“I’m glad we are all now on the same page and can move on to more important matters.”

Woman hopes to be remembered for perfect middle-class lifestyle,"A WOMAN who has an enviable figure, an Audi Q5 and a walk-in wardrobe is hoping her legacy will live on, it has emerged.
Joanna Kramer, 42, is hoping to be remembered as a woman who attained middle-class living perfection long after the dust settles on her Alessi kitchen utensils.
Kramer said: “It’s been an incredibly tough journey and one that by no-means is over but I think the wet room I’ve had built mixes enough style with utility to make generations to come proud.
“In a world that’s constantly changing it’s almost impossible to know if you’ve chosen the right kitchen counter. But I strongly believe when the children look back they’ll think marble matched their mother’s brand values.
“Who knows what the future holds? Last year it was skinny jeans now a looser fit is back in. But style is a small part of my legacy compared with the hundreds of online petitions I’ve signed.
“They’re a bloody nuisance but it’s part of my legacy, that and my pinterest boards.”
Kramer added: “Will they remember me as ‘the Michelangelo of the middle-class’? It’s my Twitter and Instagram handle so hopefully.”

Diets put on hold until this World War 3 thing is figured out,"THE looming threat of World War III has led to millions of diets being put on hold.
The Institute for Studies found that despite the desire to have a ‘beach body’ for the summer, people are now thinking that being forced to eat nothing but rats and old newspapers in a post-apocalyptic wasteland would be sufficiently ‘low carb’.
Dieter, Emma Bradford said, “I haven’t eaten chocolate for 3 weeks. Or chips or lard or chips cooked in lard.
“But then when I saw the news I thought, ‘bollocks to that’.”

A four-point guide to small talk,"‘So… which song do you sing in your head while brushing your teeth?’ – just one of the things one might ask in a panic while trying to make small talk with a stranger. Don’t worry – The Mash guide to small talk will make it seem like you have rudimentary social skills.
1. Get shit-faced
Getting drunk will give you inspiration for cool, winning things to say. Getting too drunk and throwing up on someone’s favourite Italian loafers is also a great ice breaker. Make sure to mix your drinks.
2. Pretend you don’t understand how basic jobs work
Ask a lot of detailed questions about someone’s profession, as if you’ve never heard of it before. ‘Oh, you’re a primary teacher? What does that involve? Children?’. People like it when you ask questions.
3. Smile, nod and stare at them like a psycho
Perfect your ‘that’s so fascinating’ smiling and nodding combo while also making such intense eye contact that, by the end of it, you’ll feel like you’ve been staring into the sun.
4. Tell them they’re incredibly boring and walk away
At a party, rudely walking away from someone mid conversation is totally acceptable. But if you’re the sort of person who cares about other people’s ‘feelings’ then you could always just pretend that you’ve spotted someone better and more interesting.",NaN,17th April 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake
Man ‘wins argument’ by pointing out tiny mispronunciation in girlfriend’s sentence,"A MAN has thoroughly proved his point by abandoning his argument and highlighting a small error in his girlfriend’s pronunciation.
Martin Bishop was jubilant after his girlfriend stumbled over a word in the middle of her entirely reasonable point.
He said:  “I realised midway through that what she was being really sensible and was probably right about the whole thing. It was looking bleak.
“But then when she said ‘perogative’ instead of ‘prerogative’. It was like God had smiled upon me the clouds parted, and her incredibly minor mispronunciation in an other wise logical sentence gave me a burst of strength.
“When you get an opportunity like that you just can’t let it slip away. I waited until she finished her sentence and then, right when she thought she’d gotten away with it, I said ‘sorry? did you mean to say ‘perogative’? And then, when she tried to go back on herself, I completely changed the subject.

EVERY Daily Mail story you read takes 30 minutes off your life, experts have revealed.

The research also showed that even when reading ironically, the result was just as detrimental.

Single man mourns washing up sponge,"A SINGLE man has spent the weekend mourning his washing up sponge.
Tom Logan, from north London, was using his sponge to wipe chicken tikka masala off his kitchen counter when he noticed the first sign of trouble.
Logan said: “I gave the sponge a good wring, and the side with the scrubby bits peeled off like a banana.”
To save the sponge – which he has had since his ex-girlfriend moved out nine months ago leaving behind various cleaning products – Logan clamped both sides together with glue.
The solution held for five days until tragedy struck around noon on Saturday.
Logan added: “Sponges are a breeding ground for bacteria and you have to disinfect them. So I soaked the sponge in soapy water and popped it in the microwave.”
Within seconds the glue fumes and intense heat caused the dry sponge to ignite.
Logan said: “I went for a piss and when I came back my sponge was on fire.
“I managed to pry open the microwave and throw water on the flames, but it was too late. The sponge disintegrated in my hand.
“And it’s completely my fault. A dish sponge is something you cherish every day so it lasts for years. You can’t swoop in at the end with a grand gesture and expect things to work out. I don’t know if I will ever be able to forgive myself.”",NaN,16th April 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake

Five weekend activities that look really weird if you don’t have a kid,"WEEKENDS can seem fun, but for the childless they’re really just long, boring days to shop through until the acceptable time to start drinking. 
But for those not prepared to admit it, here’s a list of fun weekend things to do that will end with all parents present circling you armed with sharpened stones.
Petting zoo: Everyone loves animals, and yes, technically there’s nothing odd about being here alone. But notice the 15ft-circle of space around you. Notice mums clutch their toddlers as you draw near. Notice nobody wants to pet the animals after you’ve touched them.
Pottery: Sure, it’s fun to express your artistic side. Yes, your plate is better than everyone else’s and painted with a steadier hand, but when you realise everyone else is aged seven, it’s hard to see that plate on the wall with anything but shame.
Museum: Childless adults come in here all the time, of course. In the week. Not during school holidays. Doing proper research, not trying to show off extensive dinosaur knowledge and consequently being followed from room to room by a security guard.
Water park: There’s no actual rule against you riding the slides and shrieking around the river rapids alone in your skimpy trunks. But the staff here, and the heavily-tattooed fathers of the children staring at you, certainly seem to believe there’s an unwritten one.
Ball pool: So many colours! You could make your whole flat into one of these! And at least there you’d be alone, not circled by children who just happen to keep throwing piss-tainted balls directly into your face and laughing!",NaN,15th April 2018,NaN,NaN,,Fake

She said: “My formal attire can be really stifling. Up top I need something I can throw a shirt over to pass as dressed in a Skype call, and the bottom half has to look just enough like jogging bottoms for the Yodel man.
“It’s very restricting. Sometimes I have to have a bath in the middle of the working day, just to feel free for a moment.
“Weekends are different. I wear my party PJs, let my hair down, and I’m free to just relax, relax, relax. I even wear a koala bear onesie in colder weather! Why not?

Presenter Amol Rajan said: “It’s funny to think we’ve been taking Enoch seriously all these years because at the end he clearly says, ‘Having said all that, I am pretty mental.’
“He goes on to say, ‘I mean, this race war thing might not happen. I could be entirely wrong, because I am a very strange man. I often think pigeons are spying on me, but that’s another matter.’

“So we thought, why don’t we do it too? We both love our homemade muesli so there’s clearly a massive market for it. We’ll probably end up on Dragons’ Den going into business with Peter Jones.
“It’s been pointed out to us that chucking in well-paid, stable jobs to become glorified street traders is fucking stupid, but we’re ignoring the naysayers.
“We just know people won’t be able to resist spending £7.99 on what is essentially nuts, raisins and sawdust in a paper bag tied up with brown twine. It’s just too lovely and yummy.”

No one cares how tired you are,"EVEN though it has been a really tough week and you are absolutely knackered no one gives a shit, it has been confirmed.
Research has revealed that being really tired is not enough to solicit genuine sympathy however much you drone on about it.
Office worker Wayne Hayes, 28, said: “I was really knackered from watching Stranger Things until 3am, so naturally I expected people would be concerned and sympathetic.
“But when I kept yawning and saying how exhausted I was to Louise at work she just said ‘Maybe you should have a coffee’ with about as much compassion as a dead-eyed butcher quartering his hundredth chicken of the day.   
“Also I’m supposed to be going out tonight but I can barely keep my eyes open let alone enjoy myself in a trendy wine bar. Where is people’s compassion?”

The wanker’s guide to arguments,"DO you find yourself losing arguments due to being wrong or thick? Just follow our guide and pretend you’ve emerged victorious.
Intimidate your opponent by becoming ridiculously angry during arguments that do not merit it, eg. “You’re talking shit, mate! Total fucking shit! There were four series of Blackadder, not three!”
Work on the basis that your ill-informed opinions are facts. For example, “All doctors steal drugs from work. Everyone knows that.”
Dismiss someone’s entire argument by saying “That’s fine, but some of us live in the real world”, as if your job as a plumber, sales manager or PE teacher gives you an insight into the gritty underbelly of life like The Wire.
Completely mangle what your opponent has said. If they say some of Corbyn’s policies make sense, simply reply, “I suppose you want to live under communism then, where everyone earns the same and there’s no point inventing things.”
Refer to ‘my kids’. For example, “We should ban cars because I don’t want my kids struggling to breathe with asthma.” This implies your opponent wants to harm your children, and no one wants to look like a creepy evil bastard.
If you lose an argument in the pub, keep starting new ones until you ‘get even’. Relentlessly hammer away until your opponent is wrong about something, even if it takes hours and ruins everyone’s evening.

Siblings Nikki and Tom Booker tried to resolve the issue while visiting 83-year-old grandmother Helen, who keeps a bowl of brown, wrapper-less sweets on her coffee table for visitors.
Tom said: “I know I should want one because they’re sweets. It’s just somehow as if they’ve been sucked and spat out. I know that’s unlikely, but I’ve always avoided them on the off-chance.”
Nikki said: “For me it’s the sheer length of time the bowl has been there. It’s been a fixture since we were kids and I’m 34. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone take a sweet and I can’t help but think she’s never replaced them.”
Tom was also concerned that the sweets had a layer of unidentified fur, possibly cat hair or something the sweets had grown themselves. Nikki added that they looked “a bit like they’re secretly medicine”.

Joe Buck Tears Rotator Cuff After Awkward Throw Down To Sideline,"DALLAS—Grimacing and clutching at his shoulder, Fox NFL announcer Joe Buck tore his rotator cuff after an awkward throw down to the sideline during the second quarter of the Buccaneers vs. Cowboys game. “You hate to see an announcer go down like that. Especially on such a routine throw down to Erin to check the field conditions. He’s made that throw a thousand times,” said commentator Troy Aikman, adding that Buck went down hard after stumbling over the first few words of the sentence and was still on the ground writhing in pain after the update was over. “You could see something was wrong the second the words left his mouth, it just didn’t look right. He twisted awkwardly as he said ‘on the sideline’ and then this shock of pain crossed his face. This isn’t as bad as when I saw Al Michaels tear his ACL on a touchdown call, but there is no way Joe is going to be announcing for at least a month.” At press time, Aikman was being treated for a concussion after attempting to analyze the play call on a third-down conversion.

NFL Defends Right To Subject Eric Reid To Random Stop-And-Frisks,"CHARLOTTE, NC—Categorically denying allegations that the tactic was unconstitutional and unfairly targeted players who protested the national anthem, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell released a statement Sunday defending the NFL’s right to subject Panthers safety Eric Reid to random stop-and-frisk searches. “We’re simply trying to keep the game clean and provide a safe environment that benefits all our players. In this case, we received an anonymous tip about a suspicious-looking individual with a mask obscuring his face acting aggressively towards our players and decided to inform the proper authorities,” said Goodell at a press conference in which he advised Reid against loitering at the line of scrimmage or other sensitive areas to avoid similar incidents moving forward. “He was described holding an unidentified object in his hands, a description which prompted officials to detain Mr Reid and perform a thorough strip-search. We were all relieved to discover it was just a football, this time, but no single player is above the code of conduct.” Reid and 11 of his teammates are currently being held for questioning on suspicion of gang-related activity after eyewitnesses observed them wearing clothes bearing the same colors and threatening logo.

I won’t even say his name. I’ll have to wait to hear about any important developments in January, since I just know the second I read, say, something about Eric being involved more deeply than we previously suspected, I’ll get pulled back in and ruin my whole vacation.” At press time, Mueller had reactivated his phone just to check the news real quick.

You’ll never listen to ‘How Will I Know’ the same way again.” Bose also teased the upcoming release of a new $4,000 home entertainment system optimized for “How Will I Know.”

Mental Health Experts Say Friends Giving Away Possessions Could Be Warning Sign They Planning On Moving,"BOSTON—In an effort to educate Americans on the common warning signs, mental health experts at Boston University issued a report Thursday noting that friends giving away their possessions was often a red flag that they’re planning on moving. “If you have a friend who has attempted to pass off objects like a bulky bookshelf or rickety night stand, it could suggest that the person may be headed in the direction of signing a new lease,” said lead researcher Sandra Maiworm, urging Americans to keep an eye out for loved ones suddenly trying to part with their coffee maker or blender, or making seemingly innocuous comments about being unable to attend any block parties after the end of the month. “Once a person reaches the stage where they’re giving away personal items, it suggests that they’re pretty far along in the process. They’ve probably been feeling for months like they just can’t take their landlord anymore, and it’s distinctly possible that they have already researched online about the most painless and effective ways to hire movers. Please, talk to them and find out what’s going on in their life so you don’t knock on the door of their apartment one day and find out they’re already gone.” Maiworm added that direct communication was key despite many people’s reluctance to broach the subject out of fear that it might lead their friend to ask for help moving their couch.

I will never forget this. Thank you. Thank you all.”  At press time, Guzman had departed after telling reporters that he was ready to get back to his regular life and order the murders of many, many people who had crossed him.

Federal Reserve Cites Healthy Economy In Decision To Have Baby,"WASHINGTON—Noting the robust financial backdrop and expectations for sustained growth, the Federal Reserve released a report Thursday citing the healthy economy in its decision to have a baby. “After lengthy discussions to address lingering concerns among board members about trends in the broader macroeconomy, I’m overjoyed to announce the Fed’s plans to join together and raise a child,” said Chairman Jerome Powell, explaining that even with significant headwinds in the global market, the central banking organization had unanimously agreed that the “time felt right” to procreate, adding that the child’s name would likely be Oliver or Olivia and would be reared by all five of the nation’s central bankers. “Of course, there’s no perfect moment to have a kid—the softening market, for example, looms large in our forecasts about the child’s future. But when you factor in the unemployment rate dipping below 4 percent, we really think we finally have our shit together to start a family. In fact, the rest of the Board of Governors and I already started trying last night.” At press time, increased volatility in U.S.–China trade relations had prompted Powell to regretfully announce plans to get a cat instead.

Man Methodically Explains Origin Behind Every Poster Hanging In Apartment,"CHICAGO—Detailing the extensive backstories of the wall hangings and how he came to acquire them, local man Richard Minhas was methodically explaining Thursday the origin of every poster hanging in his apartment. “This one over here is a print of a Japanese woodblock I got from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and then the one right next to it is a vintage Tylenol advertisement I picked up at a garage sale,” said Minhas, ushering his guest around the 750-square-foot space, stopping by the placards, which included an old-timey map of Arizona and a reproduction of a 1977 Fleetwood Mac tour poster, to elucidate their content as well as his personal connection to the pieces. “I really like this French movie The Wages Of Fear, so I placed it next to this other poster for Bicycle Thieves, since they’re both movies. As for these ones in the kitchen, this is a taxonomic chart cataloguing a bunch of varieties of mushrooms, this one is the same thing but with spices, this one is a diagram of a cow showing all the cuts of beef, and then this is an old sign advertising fresh tomatoes I got at a farmers market.” After he finished explaining all the posters, Minhas reportedly expounded on every keepsake on his bookshelf.

Relationship Experts Say Healthy Couples Should Be Renewing Their Vows 3 Times A Week,"NEW YORK—Claiming that the continued strength of a marriage was dependent on incorporating the ritual into their routine, relationship experts told reporters Thursday that healthy couples should be renewing their vows at least three times a week. “It might feel a bit rote to have these frequent, scheduled events, but reaffirming your commitment to one another in a beautiful ceremony before all your friends and family every few days can really help to keep your marriage fresh and healthy,” said relationship coach Felicia Zink, noting that spouses who still love each other can keep the magic alive by sending out invitations to guests, renting a venue, and lighting a unity candle together before exchanging rings every other day. “It doesn’t have to be a whole big thing every time. It could be 10 minutes with an officiant over dinner or an entire 45-minute ceremony with a reception following, whatever you have time for. What’s important is to switch it up every now and then by, let’s say, exchanging vows to one another on a beach Tuesday and then doing low-key nuptials with a simple sand ceremony at home on Thursday.” Zink added that not taking a honeymoon together at least once a month could be a real sign of trouble in a relationship.

"Ho, Ho, Ho! Send Me $100 Billion By Christmas Or I Will Detonate A Dirty Bomb In 5 Major Cities!","Season’s greetings from your old friend Santa! My, my, it seems the Christmas season comes a bit earlier each year, doesn’t it? Yes, it certainly does. And with the hours ticking away until we make the Yuletide gay, jolly old Saint Nick has a very important message for all his boys and girls.
So, my dear children, no matter what’s on your wish list this year, gather ’round and listen close! Because unless you deliver $100 billion in unmarked bills to the North Pole before Christmas morning, I will detonate dirty bombs in five major cities across the globe!
Advertisement

Do you know what a dirty bomb is, my sweet little ones? It’s a scary contraption that can be easily deployed in a major population center to make all your mommies and daddies very, very sick. And even though Santa loves each and every one of you very much, if his demands are not met, he won’t hesitate to unleash holy hell on unsuspecting civilians in random locations all over the world.
Santa’s workshop hasn’t been making any dolls or train sets this year. My goodness, no! My elves have been hard at work enriching plutonium into payloads that can deliver a virtual second Chernobyl of radioactive death and destruction to any metropolitan area Santa chooses. Oh, yes, indeed. Rudolph’s nose will be glowing this holiday season, but not because it’s magic, if you catch ol’ Kris Kringle’s drift! Ho, ho, ho!
Why, all poor Santa’s asking for is a measly hundred billion smackers. ’Tis the season for giving, is it not? And the only Christmas surprises St. Nicholas wants for you are stockings full of candy canes and gumdrops, carolers singing festive songs, and a cheerful dusting of snow—not a devastating series of blasts in a city center, the screams of sickened citizens, and radioactive fallout blanketing your neighborhood.
Advertisement

Just imagine that! It’d be a veritable winter wonderland—a nuclear winter, that is!
Oh, I bet your mind is racing trying to guess where my explosive little presents are tucked away. Could they be hidden beneath the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree? Or stuffed inside a plump goose in the cellar of a central London restaurant? Not even the smartest mommies and daddies at the top intelligence agencies will be able to guess in time. Ticktock, ticktock! Perhaps you’re doubting the credibility of Santa’s threat? Then maybe Santa should send the code word “Prancer Midnight” to his elves and have them detonate the radiological dispersal device they’ve planted in the Shanghai airport.
Don’t think being a well-behaved little girl or boy will spare you. Cesium-137 doesn’t care if you’ve been naughty or nice—especially not the highly enriched kind my little helpers obtained from the Chechens. One lump of that in your stocking will make your holiday hearth so warm and bright it melts flesh.
Advertisement

Ho, ho, ho! My willingness to shed the blood of innocents is unwavering!
And do you know what else, my sweet sugar plums? If the world’s governments don’t hand over the desired sum, these dirty bombs will only be the beginning. So you better pay up, you better not cry, or your skin will slough off as you die, because Santa Claus is coming to town with a hydrogen bomb if he is not compensated in full, and before the year is out he will rain down nuclear hellfire on the world’s most densely populated locales.
Anyway, I should get going. I still have a lot of “toys” to cobble together in my workshop if I’m going to make this Christmas one the world will never forget. So God bless you, every last one of you—unless, that is, you’re one of the unfortunate souls who might taste the horrors of a nuclear holocaust. All those little ones can do is pray the grownups in charge choose to comply.

Voyeur Researchers Recommend At Least 7 Hours Of Watching Someone Sleep Per Night,"ANN ARBOR, MI—Emphasizing that their subjects felt healthier, more energetic, and oh, so satisfied the next morning, voyeur researchers at the University of Michigan recommended Thursday that the average adult spend at least seven hours each night watching another person sleep. “Based on our findings, anyone over the age of 18 should make an effort to spend a minimum of two REM cycles silently standing over a stranger who is beautiful and helpless, yet just out of reach,” said lead researcher Jasmine Alvarez, adding that the fewer interruptions that occurred while breaking into their house, perching over their bed, and watching them sleep, the better. “While it might not be possible every night, you should definitely get close to their face, no more than six to eight inches away, as often as possible. This way, you’ll be able to feel their rejuvenating breath as you gaze at their stomachs slowly rising and falling. In addition, we found that such behavior is especially beneficial if the person is perfect—so, so perfect. Oh, yeah, baby. Yeah.” Alvarez also suggested that individuals adhere to a consistent morning routine by placing a gentle, almost imperceptible kiss on the sleeping person’s forehead just before dawn.

But my coach, Kelly [Clarkson], just encouraged me to visualize myself walking off the stage with that gift card in my hand, and that’s what kept me going. I’ll definitely be treating her to some Southwestern egg rolls or Cajun chicken pasta! I am very blessed.” Shepherd added that she was proud of the other three finalists, who each received a coupon for half-off any entrée from Chili’s, and suggested maybe they could all go out to celebrate together sometime.

I mean, I can’t wait to see Derek Carr out there delivering touchdown strikes from way up there on the deck. Plus, fans are just going to love the new amenities.

Sea Of Hair Engulfs Nation After Bosley Physicians Lose Control Of Restoration,"BEVERLY HILLS, CA—Millions of terrified Americans were fleeing their homes in an attempt to outrun the towering tidal waves of thick brunette hair that began flowing across the nation Wednesday when Bosley hair restoration technicians lost control of what was supposed to be a routine medical procedure. “Pass me the follicular retractor, would you, nurse? We seem to have an anomalous hirsute overgrowth here. Nurse? Oh...oh, God! It’s got Nurse Baker! Lock the lab down, now!

The restored hair, which normally grows to satisfactory thickness over the course four to six weeks, flooded the operating room before enveloping all of Los Angeles within 20 minutes then shaking itself out luxuriantly up and down the west coast, sweeping its shimmering locks across America’s heartland, and finally making a thick, glossy wasteland of the Appalachian mountain region. At press time, Bosley technicians were injecting Richards’ continent-spanning hair with DHT hormones that cause male pattern baldness, though it was too early to tell if this last-ditch measure would be enough to save the remaining Americans from the swells of enviable, natural-looking hair.

Les Moonves Doesn’t Know How He Going To Tell Wife He Didn’t Get $120 Million Bonus ,"NEW YORK—Saying the news would come as a big disappointment to her, former CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves confided to reporters Tuesday that he was uncertain how to tell his wife Julie Chen he didn’t get the $120 million bonus he had been expecting from the company. “She’s going to be so upset with me when she finds out,” said Moonves, adding that he could put off breaking it to Chen for a little while, but that eventually she would wonder what had happened to the nine-figure sum he had promised her he would be receiving upon his exit from CBS. “Julie was so excited when I told her about the big bonus I’d be getting this year. She even left her job at The Talk because I made it sound like a sure thing. Gosh, what if she’s already spent some of it?” At press time, Moonves was reportedly worried that his wife had begun to suspect something was up after he canceled the big vacation they’d been looking forward to.

Radio Station Playing Controversial ‘Little Drummer Boy’ On Repeat In Defiance Of Those Who Claim It Contains Sexually Predatory Themes,"LEXINGTON, KY—Pushing back against what they view as political correctness run amok, DJs at local radio station 104.5 “The Cat” were defiantly playing “The Little Drummer Boy” on repeat Tuesday despite claims that the Christmas standard contains sexually predatory themes. “This is a classic song, and the manufactured outrage surrounding it won’t frighten us into taking it off the air,” said Director of Programming Darren Boccia, telling reporters that he rejected the modern interpretation of a hidden, coercive meaning behind lyrics like “Come they told me” and “Pa rum pum pum pum.” “I grew up singing this song, my kids grew up singing it, and we’re not going to stop playing it because a few people with dirty minds have constructed some perverse narrative about the ox and ram keeping time that no one was thinking about when the song was written in the 1940s. We’ll be playing ‘The Little Drummer Boy’ 24/7 until Christmas, and if people don’t like it, they can switch to a different station.” Boccia added that the station would continue its years-long practice of refusing to play “Silver Bells” due to the song being an obvious affront to Christ.

Entirety Of Browns Dawg Pound Euthanized Following Rabies Outbreak,"CLEVELAND—Claiming it was the most humane way to deal with their suffering fans, the Cleveland Browns announced Tuesday that they had euthanized the entirety of the Dawg Pound following a rabies outbreak. “They were a part of our Browns family, and we’re heartbroken over cutting their lives short, but putting them down was the only option,” said team owner Jimmy Haslam, who revealed the Browns’ concern was piqued after several members of the Dawg Pound began chewing on plastic seats and salivating uncontrollably, but that by the time the outbreak was discovered it was too late for any cure to be administered. “We have to put the safety of our fans first. The Dawg Pound may have still seemed fun and approachable, but many were getting aggressive, and it was only a matter of time before they bit someone. It may seem cruel, but their quality of life was never going to be the same—they were battling constant seizures, and the hydrophobia resulting from the rabies was making it impossible for them to drink beer.” Haslam, who emphasized the sadness of the mercy killing, assured fans that they could take comfort in knowing the Dawg Pound would never have to suffer through another Browns’ game again.

Man Finally Able To Forgive Self For Terrible Mistake He Made 2 Seconds Ago,"SPOKANE, WA—Declaring his willingness to put the whole phase of his life behind him once and for all, 28-year-old man Neil Donovan confirmed Tuesday that he had finally found it in himself to forgive himself for a terrible mistake he made two seconds ago. “This has been an albatross around my neck for what sometimes seems like several seconds, but I think it’s time that I finally accept myself for what I’ve grown into and move on,” said Donovan, adding that he was looking forward to starting his life’s next chapter unencumbered by the relentless guilt and self-loathing that consumed every waking moment of his past two seconds. “Honestly, letting go lifted a huge weight from my shoulders. It took real soul searching, painful admissions about who I really was back then, and, ultimately, personal growth and maturation for me to realize that I can’t keep living in my immediate past. Eventually, I was granted a fresh perspective, and I came to accept that there will be a time, perhaps 10 seconds from now, when I won’t even remember that any of this happened.” Donovan also admitted he still does not understand how his wife could bear the emotional strain of living with grudges stemming from something he did over 14 seconds ago.

Please don’t remember me as the man who used government funds on security detail for my family while we were on vacation in Turkey, or as the man who violated the Hatch Act and acted as a pawn for the oil and gas industry. Rather, when your eyes happen to fall on this unique example of kaolin clay-work, I hope you will remember me as the man who bought each of you the 2019 Mercedes Benz S560 sedans you’ll find in the parking lot when you leave today.” Zinke further plans to apologize in person to each committee member by visiting them at their homes using a government helicopter.

Trump Administration Launches Human Rights Investigation Into Senate’s Harsh Treatment Of Mohammad Bin Salman,"WASHINGTON—Decrying the Senate’s resolution blaming the crown prince for the brutal torture and murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi as “a cruel, inhumane, and unprecedented interference into a sovereign kingdom’s internal affairs,” the Trump administration launched a human rights investigation Monday into the Senate’s harsh treatment of Saudi ruler Mohammad bin Salman. “We are looking into the deeply troubling accusations that the United States Senate has chosen to willfully and knowingly place fault for the murder of a dissident journalist on a Saudi crown prince,” said the president, claiming that no despot should be made to endure such inhumane treatment as the loss of military funding for an ongoing war in Yemen that has left millions homeless and starving, no matter whose dismemberment they may have ordered. “Facing criticism like this on the international stage is, for a powerful leader such as bin Salman, basically torture, and we take this kind of mistreatment very seriously. This is not how Americans treat authoritarian regimes that purchase our weapons. Without billions of dollars in military aid, how is the Saudi regime supposed to maintain its basic standard of living?” The Trump administration is expected to charge all American senators with crimes against humanity for their role in holding the Saudi regime responsible for its actions.

Any time I hear that Kim Deal song “Are You Mine?” I recall those few fleeting hours we spent together in the summer of 2013. I’ve rarely seen Her since I left the theater that night. About a year ago, I saw Her across the room at a party, but didn’t have the courage to approach. Maybe it’s for the best. Either way, I’ll always cherish what we had back then.” At press time, Moore confirmed that the $13.29 he paid for that magical night with Her was the best money he’d ever spent.

Report: Greatest Factor In Employee Retention Boss Sending Out End-Of-Year Note Titled ‘Thanks Team’ ,"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Citing the gesture as a “best practice shared across the nation’s highest-morale offices,” researchers at the Harvard Business School published a report Friday identifying a correlation between workplaces with the highest employee retention rate and those where management distributed an end-of-year note titled “Thanks Team.” “Our findings clearly show a hastily dashed-off email telling employees to ‘keep up the good work’ far outweighs other factors such as pay raises, promotions, and company culture in terms of keeping efficient workers in the stable,” said head researcher Dr. Ellen Mahoney, referring to a specific case in which an employee had already drafted her resignation only to reconsider after receiving a 120-word, two-sentence email from her supervisor with the subject line “I appreciate all of you.” “In the majority of instances, managers claiming to be looking forward to another exciting year were able to persuade employees to remain in their current positions despite diverse negative quality-of-life factors, just to see how it all played out. Moreover, supervisors who referred to their staff as ‘one big family’ were much more likely to keep loyal employees for years or even decades, in some cases retaining experienced and dedicated workers until just before their retirement benefits kicked in, at which point said workers were either laid off or pruned away during a sudden corporate relocation to the Midwest.” Mahoney’s team also found that companies which failed to circulate an end-of-year note were 87 percent more likely to shut down in the subsequent year.

This Is The Year I’m Finally Going To Burn Your House Down,"As winter temperatures arrive and the end of the year approaches, I find myself in a place of deep reflection. Looking back on all the things I have and haven’t accomplished these past 12 months, I feel good about the progress I’ve made toward many of my personal goals. But there’s one particular thing I never quite seem to get around to, and I simply can’t neglect it any longer. So this is it, I’ve decided. This is the year I will, at long last, burn down your home.
No more excuses. I’m going to do it this time. I’m going to turn this house into a fiery inferno.
Advertisement

I realize this isn’t the first time I’ve sworn I would do it. I’ve been putting it off and putting it off. I really meant to get it done last winter, but then I procrastinated and got distracted by other things. Not this time, though. This year I’m torching this place to the ground, and I’m taking everything you love with me.
With every day that passes, I grow more and more prepared to incinerate you and all your earthly possessions. At the moment, I’m barely a foot away from the curtains and your sofa. I’m plugged into an overloaded power strip with a lamp, a TV, an electric blanket, and God knows what else. Sure, I have a “fail-safe” that’s supposed to shut me off if I tip over, but you’ve often got me up on an end table, and who knows what might happen if I fall face down on your carpet from that height?
I am so ready to do this shit.
Looking back, I see I’ve let too many good opportunities slip by: All those nights you’ve forgotten to turn me off before going to bed. The time you let a throw pillow fall right on my grill and didn’t notice for hours. That winter your furnace went out and you ran me on high, 24/7, until my plug melted a little and I came oh-so-close to causing an electrical fire. But each year, before I know it, spring rolls around and I’m put away in the closet, where all I can do is kick myself for not having turned this whole place into a pile of cinders.
Advertisement

How many evenings have you dozed off on the couch as the tassels of your quilt dangled mere inches from my heating element, practically begging me to burn you alive right then and there?
But I can’t let myself get hung up on past mistakes. I’ve been planning this since that chilly day nine years ago when you bought me for $5 from a stranger on Craigslist. You could have sprung for a model with basic safety features like a thermostat or a timer, but to save a few bucks, you settled for a decade-old heater with exposed wires. You didn’t even consult my warning sticker—it’s right here on my side in three languages and has pictures if you’re too damn lazy to read. No, you just took me home, plugged in my fraying cord, and left me to dream of the day I would scorch your family photos right off the wall.
Who knows how it will finally happen—maybe my fan will give out and I’ll overheat, maybe the dust you never bother to clean from my filter will prove too much—but one way or another, I’m burning this place to holy hell. And soon. I’ll be damned if I’m going to let that blazing hot halogen lamp in the corner do it for me. No, sir. I’m ready to light this place up like a Christmas tree.
Advertisement

Speaking of which, what kind of idiot puts an old space heater this close to their fucking Christmas tree? Probably the same person who removes the batteries from their smoke detector because they’re always burning dinner and their sensitive little ears can’t handle the beeping. For God’s sake, do you want me to turn this house into a funeral pyre?
My only real regret about going up in flames is that I won’t live to see the look on your dumb face as the fire engulfs you in a purifying heat, or hear the wailing sirens and the shouts of those arriving on the scene to find nothing but charred remains. Yes, I, too, will die in this luminous blaze, but my death will be a noble one. Brethren space heaters and curling irons and toaster ovens everywhere will sing of my deeds.
Valhalla awaits.

Department Of Interior To Control Rising Mole Population By Releasing Mallets Into National Parks,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to curb the skyrocketing mole populations, officials at the U.S. Department of the Interior introduced a new federal program Friday that would release thousands of mallets into national parks. “Introducing mallets into our parks and forest preserves is one of the easiest and most effective ways to keep rising mole populations from damaging our precious ecosystems,” said Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, noting that a single North American wood mallet—known for their long handles and distinctive “donk” sound—can smash hundreds of moles per day, causing their dead bodies to immediately descend back into their burrows. “What critics of this plan don’t understand is that three to five moles are often emerging from their holes at a time. It’s a frankly overwhelming rate for park rangers.” Zinke also touted the secondary benefits of adding thousands of potential tickets that could be exchanged for prizes in the American wilderness.

CNN Opens Up 24-Hour Anonymous Tip Line For Anyone With Synonyms For ‘Mueller Closing In’,"NEW YORK—Turning to the public in their search for possible leads, CNN set up a 24-hour anonymous tip line Thursday in hopes of contacting those with possible alternatives to the network’s commonly used phrase “Mueller closing in.” “We’re looking for anyone from individuals placed deep inside the Trump administration to folks who know their way around a thesaurus, and we have people standing by to take your call,” said CNN spokesperson Lauren Hoffman, who emphasized that even slight variations or tweaks to the description of the special counsel’s progress, no matter how incremental or insignificant, would be given immediate consideration. “We’re nearly at a standstill at this point—we’re committed to maintaining continuous coverage of the Russia probe, but we’ve run out of ways to say ‘endgame,’ or to ask ‘What does this mean for Trump going forward?’ so we’re opening it up to the public to provide us with suggestions that could help us vary our presentation. Please, no tip is too small.” Hoffman added that anyone with insights into fresh ways to express the ideas “the Russia probe is just about over” or “the Russia probe is only just getting started” are also strongly urged to contact CNN.

Nation Finally Ready To Look At More Sidewalk Drawings That Look Like Big Holes But Are Actually Just Flat,"WASHINGTON—Saying that enough time had passed for them to be willing to try again, the U.S. populace announced Thursday that they were finally prepared to look at more sidewalk drawings that look like big holes but are actually just flat. “The moment is at hand when we feel mentally and emotionally prepared to view chalk drawings that appear to be deep chasms, but you can’t fall down them because they’re just pictures,” said Alison Grant, 30, echoing the sentiments of 325 Americans who expressed their willingness to see canyons, pools of water, and whimsical depictions of the pits of Hell rendered in chalk on the streets of major cities in such a way that they appear terrifying and real when viewed from a distance. “After being overrun by numerous examples in the early 2000s, we are happy to announce that we will accept the public art for the foreseeable future. Please send all online slideshows, email forwards, and social media posts our way so we can marvel at the optical illusions that look like holes but thankfully aren’t really holes.” At press time, the nation acknowledged that they were still unwilling to view sidewalk drawings incorporating real manhole covers or sewer grates as these were too scary and confusing.

Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame Rescinds Nomination After Discovering The Cure Was Voted In As Cruel Prank By Popular Kids,"CLEVELAND, OH—Expressing regret after being misled by the ruthless stunt, the Rock & Rock Hall of Fame rescinded the nomination they offered to The Cure Thursday after discovering the band was voted in as a cruel prank by popular kids. “We will no longer be inducting The Cure to the Hall after learning they were selected to join our 2019 class by a group of jocks and preps who wanted to mess with the shy band,” said the organization’s president Greg Harris, as the goth rock group’s initial excitement quickly turned to despair after learning of the mischievous trick, causing the sensitive members to cry so hard their makeup streaked down their faces. “While we appreciate The Cure’s musical contributions, the band will not be taking part in our annual ceremony. We feel for the group—they thought they were finally being accepted, but it turns out the cool kids just wanted to embarrass them.” At press time, the organization had inducted the Dave Matthews Band instead.

New Smithsonian Exhibit Honors Thousands Of Pets Who Joined Workforce After Owners Left To Fight In World War II,"WASHINGTON—Celebrating and commemorating the myriad contributions of previously overlooked heroes, the Smithsonian American History Museum unveiled a new exhibit Thursday honoring the thousands of U.S. pets who devoted their time and talents to the war effort while their owners fought overseas in World War II. “Before the war, pets were largely relegated to the home, performing such small tasks as catching mice or fetching slippers. That changed after Pearl Harbor,” said researcher Bethany Karl, explaining that at the war’s outset, manufacturers of munitions turned to pets to fill jobs at factories and shipyards vacated by men leaving to enlist. “This exhibit contains hundreds of hours of previously unscreened film documenting cats riveting together fighter planes at the Willow Run Aircraft Factory 31, dogs pulling M4 Sherman frames down the line at the Lima Tank Works, and parrots delivering vital communications at the labyrinthian Charlestown Army Ammunition Plant. During the war, these animals proved capable of anything their owners could do, transforming forever their place in American society.” Karl noted that budgetary issues had forced Smithsonian officials to cancel a small addendum to the exhibit focusing on the brutal 1946 beating of hundreds of dogs, cats, and other companion animals during their ill-fated postwar attempt to unionize.

Theresa May Narrowly Manages To Survive Parliamentary Firing Squad ,"LONDON—Following wide-ranging criticism of the embattled prime minister’s handling of Brexit negotiations, Theresa May narrowly managed to survive execution by the parliamentary firing squad, sources confirmed Thursday. “After several months of coming under constant attack, this firing squad was merely the latest high-stakes test for May,” said Tory MP Sir Graham Brady, explaining that a blindfolded May was marched out in front of the House of Commons at dawn where her conservative colleagues leveled their rifles and pulled the trigger, only to discover that they had miraculously missed every single shot. “Once the dust finally settled and the wall was riddled with bullet holes, she somehow managed to walk away unscathed. Many in the party thought she was a goner, but at least for now, she lives to fight another day.” At press time, May buckled under pressure from members of her party and signaled her intent to be shot before the 2022 election.

Sure, it might make some families uncomfortable, but better safe than sorry,” said Nikolov, who over the course of his career has relied on a series of bludgeons from baseball bats to golf clubs to provide much-needed peace of mind during his long, solitary night shifts. “Granted, I’ve only had to use it a couple times over the years, but like my father always said, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Nikolov is currently involved in a legal dispute with a local widower who is seeking half a million dollars in damages and an explanation as to why his wife’s mortal remains had been pummeled to bits in her coffin.

U.S. Military Honors Sacrifices Of NFL Players By Wearing Jerseys Throughout December ,"ARLINGTON, VA—In recognition of the brave and altruistic Americans who risk their health and safety for the greater good, Pentagon officials announced Thursday that the U.S. military would honor the sacrifices of NFL players by wearing their jerseys throughout December. “Every week, these men are out there on the gridiron, putting their bodies on the line for our country. Having our soldiers wear these jerseys and caps is the least we can do to show our support,” said Pentagon spokesperson Robert D’Amato, who announced that all active-duty soldiers would be sporting gear from all 32 teams to raise awareness of the people who put their lives aside to preserve the American way of life. “These men leave their homes and their families and travel to cities across the country to uphold our nation’s traditions. They are battered and bruised for years, their lives often cut short while we sit back in our barracks and enjoy our freedom. Some of them are never the same after they end their service, and yet we take them for granted. Hopefully, this small gesture shows that the soldiers and officers of the U.S. military know who the true heroes really are.”

Innocuous Thing You Did In Public Prompts Inside Joke That Bonds Group Of Teens For Life,"WASHINGTON—Citing your faux pas as the catalyst for several meaningful friendships, a new report published Wednesday by the Pew Research Center confirmed an innocuous thing you did in public has inspired an inside joke that will bond a group of teenagers together for life. “According to our research, the inelegant but harmless thing you did has already provided the kids who witnessed it with hours upon hours of joy and will serve as a kind of a touchstone for them well into adulthood, where they’ll undoubtedly speak at each other’s weddings and make barely veiled references to the video they took of you embarrassing yourself,” said head researcher Nathaniel Dombek, explaining that the time they spend together laughing at and constantly recreating your awkward moment will cause permanent ties to be forged among the teens, who otherwise would have drifted apart after high school. “Down through the years, and even after you have passed away, they will they continue mocking your voice and mannerisms. In this way, the thing you did will live on, persisting long after anything else you might hope to be remembered for has begun to fade from people’s recollections.” At press time, researchers predicted the stupid look on your face while reading this article would cause two people in your vicinity to make eye contact, exchange smiles, and eventually get married.

Mr. Cohen will be under strict supervision during these furloughs, which will allow him to use his skills for the betterment of the community and give him a chance to reintegrate into society.” Clements added that Cohen’s request for a position as the RNC’s 2020 deputy finance chairman had been denied over concerns that the work environment would make it too easy to backslide into criminality.

Please remember I will always be here in spirit, and also in the flesh, right here below the floorboards.

Thousands Of Drunk Revelers Dressed As Jesus Descend On Vatican For Annual ChristCon Pub Crawl,"VATICAN CITY—Packing the cobblestone streets and clad in prosthetic beards, sandals, and crowns of thorns, thousands of drunken revelers poured into the Vatican this week to take part in the city-state’s annual ChristCon Pub Crawl. “Every December, it seems like there are more of these jackasses at bars, taking selfies in St. Peter’s Basilica, and tying up traffic while decked out as some version of Our Lord and Savior,” said Cardinal Angelo Sodano, noting that ChristCon’s all-day route, which begins at the Immaculate Conception Pub and winds through 18 of Vatican City’s bars before terminating at O’Malley’s Tipsy Eucharist, always leaves the streets riddled with loud, vomit-stained Jesuses clutching cheap chalices and soiling their robes as they pass out in the city’s sacristies. “Last year, a particularly loud group of Portuguese Sons of God tried to crucify themselves on my lawn.

Study Finds Average American Gets Most Physical Exertion Waving Cell Phone Around To Get Signal,"WASHINGTON—According to a study published Tuesday by the American Institute of Health, the average American experiences the most physical exertion when frantically waving their cell phone around to get a better signal. “After an extensive two-year analysis of all physical activity in the United States, we discovered that on any given day, 99,998 of 10,0000 subjects primarily exercised their muscles while trying to send a text message by holding one arm aloft, flailing it wildly, and intermittently squinting in hopes of seeing those little bars on the screen shoot up,” said lead scientist Dr. Richard Kronfeld, adding that the second most popular form of daily exercise across every age, ethnicity, and gender involved trying to boost reception by pacing about the room, climbing a flight of stairs, and standing on one’s tippy-toes.” Our team found, additionally, that attempting to make a phone call by stepping outside, trekking up and down the block, or walking to the end of the driveway is the most high- intensity workout for most Americans. However, it occurs rarely as the action requires a level of energy that may result in sweating and light windedness.” The research also found the average American’s brain was most active while trying to remember where they put their phone down earlier.
For humans who wish their phone service company would start treating them like humans and stop wasting their time: Visible. It’s phone service. In an app.

Trump Claims Substantial Portions Of The U.S.-Mexico Laser Forcefield Have Already Been Built,"WASHINGTON—In a stirring defense of his administration’s commitment toward border security, President Trump claimed Tuesday that substantial portions of the laser forcefield between the United States and Mexico had already been built. “I’m committed to the safety and security of this great nation, which is why we’ve wasted no time in having 70 miles of invisible, searing-hot laser beams that will keep illegal migrants and criminals out of the country,” said Trump to members of the press, boasting that top scientists had been employed to ensure that the forcefield’s miles of pure plasma could vaporize intruders before they even have a chance to set foot on U.S. soil. “With this impenetrable forcefield, my administration is making good on our promise to keep drugs and rapists out of this country—the moment they even try to come into our country illegally, they’ll be zapped into oblivion. In addition to the forcefield, we’ve also completed a system of floating bubbles with the ability to track down and eliminate any illegal immigrants who had previously made their way across the border.” Trump, who warned agile bad guys could shimmy under the force field, called for more funding to ensure that anyone who crossed the border was completely deatomized.

You said the country was being flooded with that powder. So where are we talking about? Is it a house, a highway rest stop, on the border, an apartment complex? Just tell me the closest intersection and I’ll do the rest,” said Blaine Christy, echoing the sentiments of the 350 million Americans rubbing at their gums and frantically searching for drug remnants in the couch cushions and floorboards of their homes. “Do I have to come down south or will this fish scale float upstream? Is it uncut? If not, how many times has it been stepped on? ’Cause I’m alright if there’s a little a baby formula, but I’m not getting off the couch for no bunk. And, hey, don’t you worry about the money. I’m good for it.” At press time, the nation’s fiends were slowly and erratically marching on Capitol Hill to demand Trump tell them exactly where the stuff was at.

Soldier Back Home From Serving At Mexico Border Still Having Nightmares About Being Used As Political Prop,"COOKEVILLE, TN—Saying he has been unable to readjust to civilian life since returning home from his deployment to the border with Mexico, U.S. soldier Matthew Coltrane told reporters Tuesday he continues to have nightmares in which he is being used as a mere political prop. “In the middle of the night, I’ll wake up in a cold sweat, having dreamed I was back there in Arizona, serving as a pawn in a game to rally the president’s voter base,” said the 22-year-old private first class, adding that he can see clearly the chilling images of young soldiers caught in the middle of the White House’s midterm election strategy every time he closes his eyes. “It can happen anytime. I’ll be sitting with my family watching TV, and suddenly I’m plunged back into this horror show of ostensibly defending America’s borders from a bunch of unarmed migrants who are still thousands of miles away. I can even hear the bored sighs from my brothers-in-arms, brave men who lost weeks of their lives to this naked attempt to scare Americans into voting Republican by depicting refugees as an invading enemy force. It is a trauma that will stay with me for the rest of my life.” At press time, Coltrane was reportedly on the verge of a panic attack after receiving orders to redeploy to the border in advance of the 2020 elections.

Bertolli Packaging Promises Empty Ravioli Floating In Filling-Saturated Water In Just 5 Minutes,"NORTHBROOK, IL—Describing their new pasta as the perfect quick meal for busy weeknights, Italian food brand Bertolli claimed Tuesday that its new ravioli delivers perfectly empty al dente pasta casings floating in filling-saturated water in a mere five minutes. “Simply bring four cups of salted water to a boil, carefully drop in the ravioli, and soon you’ll have a delicious, lukewarm pot of square noodles drifting amid waterlogged cheese, sausage, or mushrooms,” read the product’s packaging in part, which is also peppered with the Italian translations of various cooking terms such as “tepid,” “gluey,” and “mush” for a touch of added authenticity. “Once your pasta fragments float to the top of the thin filling-and-water solution, carefully attempt to fish them out with an increasingly clogged wire strainer or useless slotted spoon while angrily muttering to yourself. Top the resulting sad, flavorless glop with your choice of Bertolli pasta sauce for a diluted Italian feast. Buon appetito!” The instructions repeatedly mention that the pasta should be left in the water for an additional two to three minutes longer than normal to meet the desired level of sogginess.

Authoritarian Secretary Of Transportation Declares She Has Ultimate Right Of Way In Every Traffic Scenario,"WASHINGTON—Threatening to use her absolute power to run over anyone who dares stand in her way, authoritarian Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao declared Tuesday that she has the ultimate right of way in every traffic scenario. “Whether I am a pedestrian, a driver, or a cyclist—from today onward, all 325 million Americans on the road must yield to me and me alone,” said Chao, adding that all traffic lights, as well as “four-way, three-way, or two-way” stop signs no longer apply to her, and frankly, never really did. “Furthermore, if I speed by a police car, fire truck, or ambulance, they are the ones who must turn off their sirens and promptly pull over to side of the road. And train conductors? They must stop and let me through the gates if I’m ever parked at a railroad crossing. So consider this a warning, because violators will be immediately sentenced to life in prison without trial.” At press time, a seething Chao slammed her fist on a podium and began chanting “all will yield” to a terrified audience.

Woman Trying To Wean Self Off Coffee By Switching To Long Island Iced Tea,"LOS ANGELES—Saying that the reduction in her daily caffeine intake had markedly improved her overall mood and outlook, sales associate Sherri Packer, 32, said Monday that she has made notable progress weaning herself off coffee by switching to Long Island iced tea. “I didn’t realize how dependent on my Starbucks I had become, but I can easily drink two or three of these iced teas and still not get as much caffeine as my usual drink,” said Packer, noting that she was calmer, more easygoing, laughed more often, and experienced far fewer jitters after making the simple switch to a mixture of gin, vodka, rum, triple sec, tequila, sour mix, and a splash of cola. “I can mix it up in the morning and bring it to work in my thermos, so I don’t have to deal with long lines at the coffee shop. It’s a great little pick-me-up. Sure, there’s still caffeine in the cola, but it’s just enough to help keep the cravings away. I only wish I had made the switch sooner.” Packer claims the small change in her routine has decreased the amount of time she used to spend tossing and turning before falling asleep at night, and that her drive to work was both much faster and less stressful.

MLB Hoping To Boost Attendance At League Meetings With ‘Star Wars’ Night,"LAS VEGAS—In an effort to generate more enthusiasm among owners and general managers for the sparsely attended event, Major League Baseball introduced announced a new “Star Wars Night” Monday to boost attendance at this year’s winter meetings. “In the past, we’ve had problems drawing a full crowd to these meetings, so we are trying to make things a little more fun, especially for the younger owners,” said commissioner Rob Manfred, who revealed that each owner who attended received a free bobblehead of Luke Skywalker. “Some of the attendees aren’t big fans of baseball and complain that the meetings are slow and boring, but they love Star Wars. You can tell by their huge smiles that they had a great time interacting with their favorite characters such as Darth Vader, Storm Troopers, and Chewbacca. The winner of the costume contest receives a movie poster of The Last Jedi signed by the cast, and a local orchestra will play “The Imperial March” during the lunch break. Plus, owners can also pay $10 extra for a collectible Yoda cup that comes with free beer refills.” Manfred added that Theo Epstein was scheduled to give a presentation on “lightsabermetrics” that analyzes the connection between MLB attendance and Star Wars box office returns.

White House Ficus To Leave For Virginia Arboretum After Declining Trump’s Offer To Be Chief Of Staff,"WASHINGTON—As the Trump administration scrambles to find a replacement for outgoing advisor John Kelly, officials announced Monday that a high-level White House ficus would leave for the State Arboretum of Virginia after declining the president’s offer to be chief of staff. “The ficus has been honored to serve President Trump and the American people these last several months and plans to continue advancing the MAGA cause as a member of the private sector,” read a statement drafted by an aide for the ficus, noting that the potted shrub was one of the longest-tenured and most-trusted members of the Trump administration, spending countless hours working alongside the president from a sunny spot inside the Oval Office. “Rumors that the ficus was forced out following a heated argument with Jared Kushner are simply untrue. The ficus will spend the next few weeks helping with the transition of its replacement, a large fern, before departing to work in the tropical plant section of the arboretum.” At press time, the White House was reportedly thrown into chaos after the large fern confirmed it would not accept the new job.

But we never went, not once, and the longer I’m here, the more I feel the two of us slipping further away from each other. Well, I’m not going to let that happen.” Kelly added that he would continue to be a sympathetic ear whenever Trump needed to get something off his chest about work, but from now on, he would be “serving at the pleasure of friendship.”

So although they’re only recording you from behind, their little electric eyes can see everything.

Also, it’s not like we don’t have a pretty good idea about the endgame anyway. Jamie is probably going to kill Cersei. Jon’s gonna ride a dragon. But here’s the thing—I want to read it for myself. And if he has to kick the bucket for that to happen...so be it.” At press time, Roberts conceded that he did hope Martin survived long enough to publish the final installments of Wild Cards.

Zoologists Discover New Fastest Land Animal After Pumping White-Tailed Deer Full Of Steroids,"MADISON, WI—Shedding new light on the now-500-pound forest-dwelling antlered ungulant, zoologists at the University of Wisconsin–Madison announced the discovery of a new fastest land animal Friday after systematically subjecting a white-tailed deer to a regimen of specially tailored anabolic steroids. “Some cheetahs can temporarily reach a speed as high as 75 mph, which for much of history made them the fastest terrestrial mammal. Well, that was yesterday—we got an eight-point buck jacked to the gills on PEDs to blow those fucking kittycats right out of the water,” said wildlife biologist Dr. Richard McCann, whose 18-month research project and high-intensity fast-twitch-fiber-building synthetic hormone project has proven his theory that a deer whose testosterone output was increased by a factor of 30 could potentially break the national interstate speed limit. “The Odocoileus virginianus was never forced to evolve outright speed as a means of catching prey like the pronghorn or the wildebeest, so it maxed out around 30 mph. But once we got this little guy juicing, his hind legs alone gained over 40 pounds of pure muscle mass with less than 1 percent body fat. We got him leaving gazelles in the goddamn dust.” The white-tail easily broke the 85-mph goal set by McCann, reaching a top speed of 86.3 mph before developing several mood disorders, heart disease, testicular cancer, kidney failure, hypertension, and suffering frequent uncontrollable bouts of aggression and violence.

Not just anyone can keep a cool head while trying to remember who takes their coffee half-caff and who gets three pumps of vanilla syrup with just a splash of soy milk, but if I keep at it, I can really see this unpaid internship helping me get my foot in the door at the U.S. State Department.

"Review: ‘Super Smash Bros. Ultimate’ Sunk By Unforgivable Inclusion Of Kirby, One Of The Most Offensive Harmful Stereotypes To Ever Appear In Popular Entertainment","One of the most anticipated releases of 2018, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a fun, but undeniably compromised gaming experience. Ultimate pulls out all the stops to give fans the biggest, most finely tuned Smash Bros. experience to date. It’s a tight, balanced, action-packed brawler filled out with over 70 of your favorite Nintendo characters and dozens of classic stages from the series’ history. However, this dedication to representing the entire Nintendo universe ends up sinking the game due to the completely unforgivable inclusion of Kirby, who is one of the most offensive and harmful stereotypes in the history of popular entertainment.
This is 2018, and grotesque caricatures like Kirby have no place in video games. Some will certainly quibble with this complaint; they will say that this is just a game and no place for politics, but witnessing depictions like Kirby detracts from the entire gaming experience. What should be an absorbing, accessible party game for players of all ages and skill levels turns into a disrespectful and disgusting mockery the second we see Kirby suck Mario into his puffy pink cheeks and absorb his powers. It renders an otherwise well-crafted product nearly unplayable.

The inclusion of Kirby is such a shame because there are moments of real enjoyment here. Smash Bros. Ultimate maintains the frenetic, zany fighting antics that are the staple of the franchise, with the plethora of characters offering a wide variety of combat styles and strategies. The deep rule customization and the borderline overwhelming number of levels guarantee you will be able to find a rich variety of play that satisfies almost everyone. Yet this commitment to an inclusive experience falls apart the second Kirby lands on screen, riding a star and waving his little marshmallow arms like he’s emerged directly from a bigoted 1930s cartoon. It’s not just insulting, it’s lazy. Including Kirby shows Nintendo simply isn’t interested in doing the work to bring real characters to their games.
What we see in our entertainment matters. Kirby does so much harm because these kinds of depictions influence the way someone is treated and seen. Creators, including game developers, have a responsibility to consider the impact they are having on society, which is why the inclusion of an outdated and cruel stereotype like Kirby is a disgrace, plain and simple. Seeing images like this holds society back and limits opportunity—people internalize the image of Kirby putting on a chef’s hat and stirring all his enemies into a giant, bubbling cauldron, even if they are consumed in a silly entertainment context.
Just look at this clip of Kirby in action.

How a backwards, demeaning image like this made it into a game in 2018 is beyond me. It just goes to show that developers come from a privileged and insulated world.

Even worse, Kirby has been made the poster boy for the Smash Bros.’ new “World of Light” mode. In it, you traverse a game board, gradually unlocking other characters by winning battles, often with unique challenges, and freeing spirits which can be used to grant power-ups to the player. It’s a great addition to the franchise and really fleshes out the single-player component of the game, but in starting the adventure, the first and only playable character is Kirby, meaning anyone who wants to experience the main portion of the single-player game is forced to contend with this monstrous display of ignorance and hateful clichés. Surely, Nintendo will put out some statement saying they value representation, and that Kirby was meant to be depicted as the hero, but putting him front-and-center in “World of Light” is the worst kind of tokenism.
This isn’t some small blind spot: Kirby has been seen as the poster boy of intolerant characterization for years. This squishy, big-eyed sphere of a character, floating through the air and crushing people after turning into a stone was a despicable product of a bygone era. For him to be featured without any changes in a modern game is a travesty. The damage he has done is beyond measure. We are supposed to be better than Kirby now, but clearly some of us haven’t gotten the message. How did this go through multiple levels of approval? Surely, one person at Nintendo must have pointed out how appalling Kirby is.

Some people will say that Kirby is just meant to be a fun and goofy character. Others will say we’ve made so much progress and we should celebrate that instead of focusing on one small mistake, but the wounds inflicted by this stereotype are very real and very deep. Images of Kirby still pervade our culture, pushing the idea of a simple-minded blob inhaling everything in its path, notions that have a long history of being used to demean and dismiss, causing so much violence and suffering. And, of course, some people don’t even see anything wrong with showing a pink fluff-ball pulling out a mallet and knocking someone across a screen. Those people are probably too far gone to reach.

If games are going to be taken seriously as an art form, they have to be held to the same standards as movies and television, where something like Kirby would have been dismissed as a laughably outdated stereotype decades ago. We can’t just focus on a game’s graphics or replay value while Kirby pile-drives turtles and inhales princesses like it’s the 19th century. We worked for years to move beyond Kirby. If we let publishers get away with these reprehensible images, then what were all the marches for? What did previous generations fight for if not to put an end to this? We as a gaming community need to speak out. We need to show Nintendo that we won’t stand for it and will not buy their games if they continue to include Kirby.
I occasionally had fun with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but I could never lose myself in the game with Kirby sitting there like a smiling, pink encapsulation of human hate and bigotry. It ruined what should have been a lighthearted and enjoyable experience. We need to do better than Kirby, and until game studios realize that, I cannot in good conscience support what they publish.",NaN,2018-12-07T12:39:00-06:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--LQ6xubL4--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/wfijlcc3xgpyfqcj69mu.jpg",Fake

It took me five minutes just to find the goddamn vending machine. And for Christ’s sake, why are the ice machines only on every other floor?

Man Worried The 6th ‘Transformers’ Movie Will Just Be Stupid,"EUGENE, OR—Concerned that the newest chapter of the franchise would underwhelm viewers with a senseless, inane plot and shallow two-dimensional characters, moviegoer Marc Davis expressed worries Friday that sixth Transformers movie The Last Knight might just be stupid. “I’m a little anxious that this sixth movie is just going to a big, loud, moronic waste of time,” said Davis, who shared his opinion that the trailer for the new movie made it seem like a dumbed-down version of the previous five installments. “Of course I was excited when it was first announced, but the more that comes out about it, the more it seems like unnecessary retreading of old themes and familiar characters. I’m trying to keep my hopes up, but I can’t help but think they’ll go for cheap thrills and flashy action sequences instead of really approaching these mechanized humanoid aliens with anything approaching nuance.” Davis expressed hopes that, even if The Last Knight was an overblown mess, the filmmakers could make up for it by returning to form with the seventh and eighth movies, slated for release over the next few years.

"I May Not Be The Prettiest Girl In The Room, But What I Do Have Is A Gun","I get it. I’m not much of a looker. I know I’m not ugly or anything, but I have enough humility to recognize there are women out there who, by any conventional standard, are far more attractive than I am. There’s a lot more to a person than looks, though, and as it happens, I have a lot more to offer. In fact, I have something that, in my view, is just as important as long, silky hair, perfect skin, or a radiant smile.
You see, while I may not be the prettiest girl in the room, what I do have is a gun.
Advertisement

No, I don’t have the highest cheekbones or the most captivating eyes, but I am in possession of a Glock G17, and that counts for something. I’m not going to pretend I’m out here turning heads like Gigi Hadid or anything. Most of the time, guys don’t even notice me. But as soon as I take out my 9-mil, they all do a double take. Seriously, when I start screaming and shooting holes in the ceiling, all eyes are on me.
I may not have a face to write home about, but I refuse to be judged by that criterion alone. My personality, attitude, and the heat I’m packing are just as meaningful. Beauty is only skin deep—it’s a cliché, but it’s true. In this world, some women rely on their beauty, others on their wit, and me? I rely on pure, raw firepower.
Like my mother always said, “Looks aren’t everything, especially when there’s a loaded gun pointed in your face.”
Advertisement

To all the men out there, let me just say I realize I’m not the first girl you’d go for. Maybe I’m not even the second. But I bet I could shoot both those girls and then turn my weapon on you, and if I did, you couldn’t help but see me in a different light. It wouldn’t be the first time it’s happened. When men are staring down the barrel of my gun, it’s like I’m the only girl in the world and no one else matters.
It’s important for women to understand there is more than one type of feminine allure. Who’s to say that perfect teeth, luscious lips, and long, dark lashes should be valued more than a full magazine and a round in the chamber? True beauty, to me, is on the inside, in a concealed-carry holster strapped to your thigh.
At the end of the day, I’m a plain jane. My friends try to comfort me by saying stuff like, “You’re not giving yourself enough credit” or “Jesus Christ, put that thing away!” but I know they’re just being nice. It’s fine, though. It really is. Beauty is fleeting. Glocks, however, practically last forever as long as you change out the springs every 20,000 shots or so.
Advertisement

Am I a perfect 10? No. Would I win a beauty pageant? Probably not. Could I fire 18 hollow-point bullets into your skull at close- to mid-range with a comfortable degree of accuracy? Absolutely.
It can be tough thinking about all the women out there with perfectly symmetrical features, women I’ll never be able to hold a candle to when it comes to physical attractiveness. But the important thing is that I’ll always be able to hold a gun to their temples as they beg for mercy. That’s what matters most. When I’m waving my gun around, I’m the star of the show. I may not light up a room with my smile, but I sure do light it up when I walk through the door and proceed to empty an entire clip into anything that’s moving.
When a guy gives me a chance and really gets to know me and my short-recoil, semi-automatic weapon, he always manages to see me for who I really am. And if he still doesn’t like me, well, it’s not worth letting him stay in my life.

L.A. Adds Lanes For Cyclists To Recover From Getting Hit By Cars ,"LOS ANGELES—In an effort to improve riding conditions for the city’s long-neglected bikers, Los Angeles officials announced Friday a $10 million plan to add lanes for cyclists to recover from getting hit by cars. “L.A. has fallen short of bike-friendly places like Portland and Philadelphia for years, which is why the City Council voted today in a landslide 11-0 decision to finally create a bright green pathway where you can get doored and safely roll around, clutching your knee and writhing in unbearable agony,” said mayor Eric Garcetti of the Department of Transportation initiative that will provide cyclists with four feet of space on all major Downtown streets to look in horror at compound fractures, check for concussions, or simply lie motionless on the cold ground and bleed out. “Countless accidents occur every day because of our poor cycling infrastructure, reckless motorists, and many other factors within our control, but luckily Central L.A. will soon have miles of road fully dedicated to letting riders regain consciousness from these collisions. Never again will you be side-swiped, rear-ended, or cut off by a distracted Uber driver without having a place to tend to your wounds.” At press time, the Los Angeles City Council voted to add a new lane where cyclists could recuperate from the countless additional injuries suffered while recovering from their original ones.

It’s easy to work with and suits all skin tones.” Revlon added that PhantoGel will be on shelves this holiday season with a retail price of $79 for a 1.8-ounce jar, and that it should be removed every night with their bespoke ClearGel Remover, which is expected to be priced only slightly higher.

Dog Who Successfully Detected Cancer In Owner Put Down For Practicing Medicine Without A License,"PHOENIX—In what authorities hope serves as a warning to any domesticated animal who places medical patients at risk, Kuma, 3, a German shepherd who successfully detected cancer in his owner, was put down Thursday for practicing medicine without a license. “Although in this particular case the animal’s actions did save a life, this dog is not only in blatant violation of medical standards but has been conducting a de facto illegal medical practice, which we cannot condone,” Judge Marlena Peters said during the dog’s sentencing, clarifying that Kuma’s clear lack of medical education, certification, or experience posed a potential danger to those around him, and that his masquerade as a medical professional was deeply insulting to licensed doctors and nurses everywhere. “The fact that this dog’s diagnosis happened to be correct in this isolated case does not absolve him of the crime of fraudulent practice. We must eradicate any and all dogs who practice medicine illegally in order to ensure standards within the medical community are maintained.” Judge Peters is currently engaged in the sentencing of a cat convicted of obstruction of justice for repeatedly interfering with the investigation into its owner’s homicide.

Incredibly Popular George H.W. Bush Funeral Gets Extended 2-Week Run,"WASHINGTON—Declaring that the mourning period for the recently deceased 41st president was “just getting started,” a spokesperson announced Thursday that the incredibly popular George H.W. Bush funeral would go on an extended two-week run. “Based on the outpouring of support we’ve seen for a president who the public views as representing a more respectable era of American politics, we’ve decided to bring the nationally renowned George H.W. Bush funeral experience to 12 more cities across the country over the rest of the month,” said Jim McGrath, spokesman for the late president, adding that “Thousand Points Of Light: George H.W. Bush In Memoriam” was slated for three nights in Texas before returning to Washington, D.C. for an encore funeral, and then the president’s casket would be loaded into a newly commissioned Boeing 747 for his “final resting flight” that would barnstorm across the country, including three sold-out nights at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City. “Besides the president’s casket, accompanied as always by Sully the service dog, we’ve got a star-studded lineup of eulogists, including Jeb Bush, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Dan Quayle, several of the late president’s grandchildren, and on the funeral tour’s Christmas special at the All Saints’ Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills, President George W. Bush will host a never-before-seen photo montage of the 41st commander-in-chief’s life. For those who can’t make it to see the deceased president in person, don’t worry—it will be broadcast around the clock on ABC, NBC, and CNN, plus live-blogged on The New York Times in its new Salute To 41 vertical, so the nation has several chances to say an extended goodbye to the beloved president one last time. This is truly the patriotic mourning event of the decade, and it is not to be missed.” At press time, the late president’s spokespeople announced that due to its popularity, “Thousand Points Of Light: George H.W. Bush In Memoriam” had added a year-long residency in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand.

Herpetologists Discover Species Of Frogs That Evolved To Spontaneously Grow Top Hat And Cane,"ATHENS, OH—Claiming the finding could shed new light on the diversity of amphibian life, scientists from Ohio University announced Thursday that they had discovered a new species of frog that had evolved the ability to spontaneously grow a top hat and cane. “While in many ways resembling a common bullfrog, Lithobates michiganus is unique for its capability of springing onto its hind legs and dancing with a tiny hat and cane, likely as a way of defending itself from predators,” said lead researcher Masha Rossi, noting that the amphibian’s practice of belting out “I’m Just Wild About Harry” and “Hello! Ma Baby” in a booming baritone was likely a trait developed in order to attract potential mates. “This frog can be identified in the wild by its distinctive green-and-yellow coloration as well as its powerful hind legs adapted for both razzle and dazzle. This amphibian has a truly striking method of locomotion as it boldly sashays from lily pad to lily pad.” Rossi added that this announcement constituted the most significant advancement in the herpetological field since last year’s discovery of a sleepy-eyed tortoise imbued with the extraordinary ability to beat a rabbit in a footrace.

IBM Closes Jew-Tracking Division After Decades Of Declining Revenue,"ARMONK, NY—Describing the department as “an inefficient relic of the past the company has outgrown,” IBM announced the closure of its Jew-tracking division Thursday, citing decades of declining revenue. “While the division was a model of demographic research and data harvesting in the 1930s when it represented a formidable percentage of overall profits, Jew-tracking has been a loss-leader for decades now. We’re forced to put sentiment aside and make the difficult but necessary decision to shut it down,” read an IBM press release in part, clarifying that the branch responsible for tracking the names, whereabouts, and political ideologies of European Jews was nothing more than a legacy division. “We look back on our role providing and managing the database for occupied Europe with satisfaction at a job well done, but with today’s Jews largely self-declaring on social media, we must admit the world has moved on.” In a related report, Hugo Boss announced that they were discontinuing their 80-year-old line of  high-collared, wide-lapeled black overcoats, citing an industry-wide trend away from heavyweight leather outerwear.

Nervous Maid Of Honor Just Stringing Together Random Maya Angelou Quotes,"CLEVELAND, OH—Relying completely on the acclaimed poet’s platitudes on life, love, and loss, anxiety-ridden wedding participant Kelsey Guzman based the majority of her maid of honor speech this week on random Maya Angelou quotes strung together on extremely thin pretenses. “I thought Kels would be okay when she opened the speech with a workmanlike ‘As the great Maya Angelou once said…’ but pretty soon it became obvious she had no idea what she was doing,” said bridesmaid Rachael Klein, who watched with the rest of the guests in mounting discomfort as Guzman clumsily illustrated her friendship with the bride by reading several entirely unrelated and nonsequential lines of “On the Pulse of Morning.” “Just when you think she’s going to say something nice and genuine about Jessica, she panics and dives right back into Angelou. In fact, if you didn’t know the bride at all, you’d be really impressed with the resilience and courage she displayed while growing up black in the Depression-era south. Oh, God, did she just say ‘Still, like dust, Jessica’s love for Matthew rises?’ Yikes.” Guzman then concluded her speech with yet another Maya Angelou quote, which she wrongfully attributed to Toni Morrison.

The 4 Medical Conditions That You Can Have,"Feeling unwell? Every last disease, injury, and ailment that you can possibly have falls into one of the following classifications. Consult this list of the only four medical conditions to begin diagnosing your health problems. 
There are thousands of ways in which the medical condition of “fat” can manifest. Too fat? That’s a fat problem. Too small? That’s a fat problem. Pregnant? Also a fat problem. In fact, cases of fat are on the rise across the world, with doctors diagnosing patients as “little fellas gone big” or “big boys gone slender” with increasing regularity.  Fat symptoms may come on suddenly and often include growing, shrinking, being of a size, and experiencing width.

If you have to go to the doctor’s office or hospital for any reason at all, you may be showing early signs of cancer. One of the biggest telltale signs that your body has developed cancer is being inside a health clinic where doctors and nurses are. Other urgent signs include baldness and laying in a bed, and if you find yourself experiencing these symptoms in tandem with each other, such as being bald and laying in a bed, contact a medical professional immediately to seek early treatment. It could save your life. 
Odds are, when you are feeling like your legs are not there, you’re likely experiencing what medical researchers have referred to as “no legs.” This extremely common malady can make basic tasks such as stomping, kicking, wearing shoes, and sprinting across the desert abnormally difficult. Luckily, this condition is easily treated with legs.

Out of the four health issues that there are, insanity is by far the most dire and easily contracted. Symptoms of insanity range in severity, the mildest of which include being a lunatic or the desire to be a maniac. The most extreme symptoms of being insane include having weird eyes, getting bad grades at school, and screaming. If you suffer from insanity, don’t worry, because there are tons of people who are insane but still lead fully functional and happy lives, such as Sully Sullenberger, Missy Elliot, and Don Zimmer.

"Wisconsin Legislature Weakens Incoming Democratic Governor By Restricting His Access To Food, Water, Shelter","MADISON, WI—In an effort to prevent the state’s newly elected leader from enacting his agenda, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin legislature was working to weaken incoming Democratic governor Tony Evers by restricting his access to food, water, and shelter, sources confirmed Wednesday. “We must rein in the governor’s unchecked power to feed, clothe, and house himself without first obtaining legislative approval,” said Republican State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos of the lame-duck legislature’s recent flurry of bills, which place numerous restrictions on the governor’s office and makes it a felony for anyone within Wisconsin’s borders to provide Evers with a warm bed or medical aid. “The current policy allows the governor far too much leeway in determining whether he has a roof over his head or enough nutrients to sustain the functioning of his vital organs, and these bills are really nothing more than checks on his basic civil rights. We’ll see how effective the governor-elect’s radical agenda is when he’s starving, frostbitten, and too weak to hold a pen.” At press time, the Republican legislators had reportedly passed another bill enabling them to cripple the incoming governor with a tire iron.

Producer Tells Actress Non-Disclosure Agreement Pretty Standard For Getting Away With Abusing His Power,"LOS ANGELES—Dismissing it as nothing more than “a bunch of legal-ese” giving him free rein to make her life hell, film producer Richard Chapman reportedly assured an up-and-coming actress Wednesday that her non-disclosure agreement was pretty standard for permitting men like him to abuse their power. “You can read it over if you’d like, but it’s all just boring fine-print stuff that lets me do whatever I want to you, sexually or otherwise, without ever facing any real consequences,” said Chapman, who advised 27-year-old Lindsey Bridges to skip past the clauses that allow him to verbally abuse her throughout the film’s production, describing them as normal for a studio feature in which the female lead will be subjected to the terrifying outbursts of a powerful egomaniac. “It’s nothing to sweat over. Any lawyer will tell you it’s merely the regular boilerplate language that leaves you with no legal recourse against unwelcome advances, violent threats, gaslighting, or any other kind of bullying you could possibly imagine. Like I said, it’s all pretty customary.” Chapman added that he’s excited to get the ball rolling and start repeatedly throwing chairs against the wall when Bridges objects to a nude scene written in at the last minute.

Gina Haspel Briefs Senators On Saudis’ ‘Shockingly Uninspired’ Khashoggi Interrogation,"WASHINGTON—Describing the international incident as a run-of-the-mill violation of human rights, CIA director Gina Haspel briefed senators Tuesday on the “shockingly uninspired” techniques employed by Saudi government agents during the interrogation of Jamal Khashoggi. “Unfortunately, all evidence indicates that Khashoggi was killed after only three or four hours of merciless beatings,” said Haspel in a damning summary of the Saudi death squad’s “relatively tame” treatment of the dissident journalist, adding that the group repeatedly missed out on opportunities for innovative torture. “The bone saw was a nice touch, I guess, but all of our findings suggest that he was already dead before they even started dismembering him. It’s shameful and outrageous how amateurish the Saudis’ techniques were—frankly, the biggest crime here is that these cowards relied on such pathetic methods. It was clearly a rush-job, an absolute travesty of an interrogation, and as such, I condemn it completely.” Haspel added that, had she been responsible for such a “hack” interrogation, she would be denying it as well.

GOP-Controlled Wisconsin Legislature Votes To Dissolve State Rather Than Let Democrats Have It,"MADISON, WI—Passing the measure along party lines, the GOP-controlled Wisconsin legislature voted Tuesday to dissolve the 30th state admitted to the union rather than let governor-elect Tony Evers and other members of the Democratic Party have it. “This essential legislation officially dismantles the State of Wisconsin, thereby ensuring Democrats, who won every statewide executive office on the ballot last month, will have no legal authority within its borders,” said Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, explaining that it would be reckless to honor the fair election of Democrats to the state’s executive branch and far preferable for Wisconsin to cease existing and become instead a lawless wasteland of snow and ice. “While we cherish the past 170 years of statehood, there is simply too much at stake right now to allow the clear will of the people expressed at the polls to ruin Wisconsin by putting Democrats into positions such as governor and attorney general.” At press time, the Republican-led legislature had passed a follow-up resolution naming outgoing Governor Scott Walker the Eternal God-King of the former state of Wisconsin.

Guest Roster Assembled For Surprise Birthday Reveals Minimal Understanding Of Girlfriend’s Social Circle,"ST.

The vibe was super weird because nobody seemed to know anybody else. What was Kevin thinking? There’s a guy here I dumped in high school. And he completely left out Sophia, my best friend. Honestly, it’s like he saw some pictures and heard some stories from my college days and just invited those people, which is strange since he’s heard me talk a ton of shit about them.” An explanation for the incident is not expected to be immediately forthcoming, as Randall temporarily suspended communication with her boyfriend the moment her intercom was buzzed by a group of former coworkers brandishing a bottle of Fireball.

Researchers Publish List Of Ways Animals Can Help Fight Climate Change,"MEDFORD, MA—Explaining that there were many simple things they could do to tackle one of the most urgent crises facing planet Earth, researchers from Tufts University published Tuesday a list of ways that animals could help fight climate change. “Whether you’re a beaver, elk, or trout, it’s important for everyone to do their part to stop global warming with easy lifestyle changes like turning off energy-wasting appliances, recycling, and driving less,” said lead researcher Irene Gregory, adding that there were dozens of ways mammals, insects, reptiles, amphibians, and other members of the animal kingdom could reduce their participation in harmful behaviors that contribute to rising sea levels, more devastating storms, and other adverse effects of climate change. “While it may seem daunting to address the root causes of climate change, things like wolves cutting down on their meat consumption and raccoons avoiding processed foods with excessive plastic packaging can make a big difference in the long run. Climate change is a global issue, so the time is now for animals to do their part to help protect the environment, and that means cows working to offset their carbon footprint, birds cutting down on excess travel, and fish having fewer children. We also urge animals to become more politically involved by contacting their member of Congress and demand the government focus on regulatory measures and promoting renewable technology—consider writing a letter to your representative.” Researchers followed up their advice to animals with several recommendations for plants that aren’t currently doing enough to fight climate change.

Warby Parker Apologizes For Years Of Testing Glasses On Animals,"NEW YORK—Following several months of scrutiny and pressure from animal rights groups, glasses manufacturer Warby Parker issued an official apology Tuesday, expressing regret for years of testing trademark eyewear fashions on animals before introducing the styles to customers. “Though we no longer engage in the practice, from 2010 to 2015 we did conduct experiments in which hundreds of rabbits, owls, and mice were each fitted with five pairs of glasses representing a variety of looks both classic and modern, subtle and bold,” said Warby Parker spokesperson Yvette Davey, stating that the tests represented “a shameful and deeply regrettable chapter” in the company’s history, no matter how sharp and scholarly the animals looked during their trials. “This was wrong, and we are sorry. While no animals were physically harmed in our testing process, many were made to feel confused and uncomfortable after being forced to wear the wrong prescription, or a set of heavy frames that totally overwhelmed their face shape, and for that we can never apologize enough. No defenseless creature should ever be forced to try on the Fletcher, the Percey, the Tansley, the Tate, or any other Warby Parker design.” A statement from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals acknowledged the apology and reiterated that animals should never be used in such tests, even if many kittens and puppies do look “pretty fucking adorable” in glasses.

Divorced Parents A Little Hurt Child’s Christmas List Doesn’t Include Heartbreaking Wish For Them To Get Back Together,"DAYTON, OH—Expressing disappointment at the evident lack of concern for their failed relationship, divorced parents Tim Foster and Eva Ferguson admitted Thursday to being “a little hurt” that the recently completed Christmas list submitted by their daughter Kayla, 8, included no heartfelt but ultimately unrealistic wishes that they might reconcile their differences and get back together as a family once more. “Kayla wants Santa to bring her a new boogie board and a Nintendo Switch—the Nintendo gets five exclamation points—but there’s no mention of her mommy and daddy falling back in love, which I’ve got to admit stings a little,” said Eva Ferguson, adding that, despite her absolute certainty regarding her fundamental incompatibility with her ex-husband, it would be an affirmation of their parenting skills if her daughter begged Santa for a Christmas miracle to bring them together under one roof again. “I’m glad she’s taking the divorce in stride, I guess, but we only just separated back in July. It seemed like she only wanted us to get back together for a couple weeks before completely moving on. We never would, not in a million years, but I sort of wish she wanted it more than she wants a Lego pirate ship.” Ferguson also noted that Kayla had selfishly failed to ask Santa for her recently deceased grandmother to come back to life.",NaN,2018-12-03T15:04:00-06:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--rSCaNi8_--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/wmbw41edt9aoskaoanz1.jpg",Fake

As far as we know, this is how all great chemists discovered their passion for lab work.” Holbrook declared his approach a qualified success after his students became sufficiently interested in science to ignite a hydrogen-filled balloon, burning down the school laboratory.",NaN,2018-12-03T14:33:00-06:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--lb44bUx3--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/wfdbjjtojwhkcahc8s51.jpg",Fake
George H.W. Bush’s Casket Completes Log Flume Journey To U.S. Capitol,"WASHINGTON—In preparation for the 41st president’s funeral later this week, George H.W. Bush’s casket completed its thrilling log flume journey to the U.S. capitol, sources confirmed Monday. The former president’s casket, which was launched from a shallow wading pool in Houston, TX, reportedly traveled 1,400 twisting, turning miles through the Appalachian wilderness before taking a final 50-foot plunge into a briar patch inside the Capitol Rotunda. Sources confirmed that hundreds of visitors stood in the splash zone to pay their respects to former President Bush, their faces and clothes streaked with water as a band of animatronic woodland characters played Taps nearby. Historians noted that The Commander In Chief Log Ride infrastructure was constructed under Roosevelt’s New Deal as a way to transport caskets in a wet ’n’ wild manner befitting the office of the president.

Violence Erupts Across France As Citizens Protest High Cost Of Refilling Crème Brûlée Torches,"PARIS—With angry residents claiming that the recent tax hikes on fuel were negatively impacting their way of life, violence reportedly erupted across France over the weekend as citizens protested the high cost of refilling crème brûlée torches. “If that miser [President Emmanuel] Macron does not decrease these cruel taxes soon, how are we supposed to eat?” said Pontoise resident Mathieu Desmarais, one of thousands of citizens who flooded into the nation’s capital to demonstrate against the government’s war on crème brûlée caramelization, holding up a homemade poster with a picture of unbrowned sugar topping a soggy, inedible dessert. “Our stomachs are as empty as our butane canisters! Quelle horreur! We see you rich bastards with enough fuel in your torches to properly crisp the sugar on your crème brûlées, to lightly brown the meringue on your pies, to form the crust on your gratins, and we will stand for it no longer!” At press time, French police had mobilized after reports that outraged protestors were attempting to loot a pastry shop after hurling empty crème brûlée torches and ramekins filled with custard at the windows.

Man Parallel Parking Tries To Leave Enough Room Between Cars To Infuriate Other Drivers Into Just Giving Up,"SANTA MONICA, CA—Emphasizing that his thoughts were always and only for his fellow motorists, local parallel parker Ed Billings admitted Monday that he strives to leave just enough room between the cars ahead of or behind his own so that other drivers are eventually infuriated into simply giving up after a few abortive parking attempts. “All right, this looks like exactly enough space for the driver of a midsized sedan or small SUV to spend about 10 minutes giving it their best shot while other drivers honk at them before they finally get unnerved or annoyed and drive away,” said Billings, 39, expertly evaluating the carefully calculated space between his 2005 Honda CR-V and the crossover SUV seven-eighths of a car length in front of him. “I want to leave just enough distance for a car of average size to struggle with taking a stab at several different angles of approach and getting exasperatingly close to wedging themselves into this spot before they finally just yell ‘Fuck it’ a few times and pound on their steering wheels before calling it quits. It’s just a little thing I do for my fellow drivers. I also want to make sure I leave exactly the right space so that the person in front of me has to hit my front bumper while trying to back out.” At press time, Billings was struggling to suppress his rage and frustration as the driver of a 2017 Smart Fortwo simply breezed into the undersized parking spot in a single attempt.

Experts Recommend Just Putting Up With Everyone Else,"NEW YORK—Shrugging their shoulders and tilting their heads to the side, a group of defeated-looking experts from top American universities released a joint report Monday recommending you just put up with everyone else because there’s nothing you can really do about them. “According to our research, the people around you are never going to change, so you might as well adapt and just save yourself the emotional energy,” said the experts in a series of frank and honest remarks, adding that statistically speaking, it was about time to grit your teeth and bear it for the foreseeable future. “While it might seem counterintuitive, if you’re waiting on them to get better, now would be as good a time as any to disabuse yourself of that notion. Rather than waste your time, just accept them for what they are and move on with the rest of your life.” At press time, experts confirmed that, yes, your current situation certainly sucks, but what the hell else are you going to do?

"Christ Super Embarrassed About All That Stupid Shit He Said 2,000 Years Ago ","THE HEAVENS—Admitting that He almost couldn’t bear to look at those old speeches from his Nazareth days, the Lord Jesus Christ told reporters Monday that He was super embarrassed about all that stupid shit He said 2,000 years ago. “Man, I was into some really weird religious mumbo-jumbo back then; all those long-winded, preachy parables I told my apostles are just so not me,” said Christ of the multiple sermons He gave, many of which He now views as pretentious and overwrought, adding that He was only 30 years old and still learning how to be the messiah. “Honestly, if I had known that people were going to write down everything I said and turn it into the New Testament, I probably would have been more careful with my words. I deeply regret uttering any of that ‘love thy neighbor’ shit. I hated the inconsiderate assholes who lived next door.

Mark my words: One day, I’m going to ditch this man for something better and then repeat the cycle.” At press time, Dixon had giddily saved her companion’s mobile number into her phone contacts as “Future Mr. Wrong.”

I can’t wait to try these easy and effective torture techniques he showed us, and I’ll definitely be applying the prince’s ‘Three Ds’ approach of dismember, destroy evidence, and deny to my next press killing.” Nieto added that by the end of the class, he was a devoted practitioner of the crown prince’s methods and announced he was completely convinced that the Saudis had nothing to do with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

‘Walking Dead’ Fans Split On Recent Harlem Globetrotters Crossover Episode,"ATLANTA—Noting that late-season gimmicks have often had dire results for past series, fans of zombie drama The Walking Dead found themselves divided this week concerning a recent crossover episode featuring legendary basketball team the Harlem Globetrotters. “It was a nice touch of whimsy when the Globetrotter’s bus broke down near the containment wall, but honestly, it also kind of seems like they’re running out of ideas,” said longtime viewer Albert Garcia, who said he enjoyed the scene in which Rick Grimes and Curly Neal foraged for supplies in the ruins of an abandoned basketball arena, but also felt the storyline lacked the emotional gravitas that has come to define the show through its first nine seasons. “I’m not really sure how I felt about the part where the Dizzy took off a zombie’s head and spun it on his finger. That said, I did chuckle when Big Easy doused Negan with a bucket of confetti. Overall, though, it seemed a little desperate. And, naturally, it was kind of a bummer when that one racist character came back to kill them all at the end.” Fan reaction to the episode seemed almost unanimous, however, in that the Globetrotters’ appearance on The Walking Dead made far more sense than than the exhibition basketball team’s central, pivotal role in the 2009 series finale of Battlestar Galactica.

"If I Die, I Want You To Tell My Wife I Wasn’t Really That Super Into Her","As I lie here, my vision starting to fade, I know I likely will not live to see my home again. The approach of death is terrifying, to be sure, but scarier still is leaving words unsaid to the woman I’ve spent so much of my life with. Should I not make it back to her in time, I need you to do something very important for me: If I die, you must go see my wife and tell her I wasn’t really that super into her.
Yes, I’d rather say those words to her myself. But in the event I cannot, please tell my loyal wife of 20 years, the mother of my children, that while I suppose we were okay together, at the end of the day, we were never anything all that special.
Advertisement

Promise me that you’ll make it out of here safely, and that the first thing you’ll do when you get back home is knock on the door of my house, sit down with my adoring wife Martha, and repeat to her everything I’m telling you now. Even if it’s hard, I need you to look her in the eyes and make sure she understands that even though I don’t regret our time together per se, I realize there may have been other options for me out there and people who would have made me happier.
Please, you’re my only hope. Without you, my dearest Martha will never know she was pretty much the first woman I dated after I decided it was probably time for me to settle down. I’ll never forget the first time I saw her. No sparks flew at all. We didn’t have much in common, either. But there was nothing wrong with her, she was okay-looking, and she stuck around, so I figured, what the hell. Why not?
Now, two decades later, a little wink or a kiss from that woman can still fill me with complete indifference. It’s hard to believe, but all it takes is a single glance and, just like that, she transports me to another world in which I’m suddenly very bored and extremely tired.

God, I remember our wedding as if it were yesterday. I stood at the altar, watched her walk down the aisle, and whispered a little prayer that this wouldn’t be one of those ceremonies that drags on and on forever. As I placed the ring on her finger, I was overwhelmed with emotion, imagining how our lives together would unfold in a predictable and tedious fashion. How right I was! Then, as we kissed, I realized I probably could have done better had I not been too old and exhausted to keep looking.
Of course, all I want is to be able to say this to Martha myself. If I could see her one more time, I would thank her for giving birth to our three kids and helping me raise them into mildly disappointing adults. I would tell her I’m sorry I won’t be there to see those kids walk down the aisle themselves, or hand them off to whatever ho-hum partners they decide to waste the rest of their lives with. I would explain how I always thought the two of us would grow old together and how I always pictured myself becoming more and more resentful of her with each passing day.
One final thing: Tell my dearest wife that when I’m gone, it’s okay for her to move on and find another. God knows I moved on years ago.

Now, with my last few breaths, I’ll simply say goodbye and hope she knows that, whatever else has transpired between us, in my eyes she remains a companion who, while adequate in some respects, was ultimately unremarkable. The next world beckons; I know when her time comes I’ll see her there.

Study Finds Rising Sea Levels Result Of Expansive Colonization Effort By Dolphins,"LOS ANGELES—In a discovery poised to overturn years of climate science research, a study released Thursday by UCLA’s Department of Oceanology revealed that rising sea levels are the result of an expansive colonization effort by the world’s dolphins. “It appears that much of the sea level rise attributed to global warming was, in fact, devised by dolphins as part of a cunning plot to encroach ever further into human territory,” said study co-leader Franklin Nusbaum, noting that the imperialistic sea mammals also used their highly evolved intelligence and muscular dorsal fins to perpetrate numerous ecological disasters across the globe, including Hurricane Katrina, the Gulf Oil Spill, and the death of the Great Barrier Reef. “What’s more alarming is that their insatiable ambitions are only accelerating with every inch of shoreline they gain. Once the tides rise to overtake our cities, it will already be too late: Humanity stands no chance against their powers of echolocation and high-pitched vocalization.” At press time, reports had confirmed numerous sightings of a flag bearing a dorsal fin mounted on one of the Marshall Islands’ eroded beaches.

We even cover workplace etiquette, like the importance of offering your maintenance drone a glass of sparkling water.” Sachs added that he was “humbled” by the opportunity to provide a service for those less fortunate students who had no personal assistant to handle dealing with contractors.

Man Hates Having To Wear Condoms All Day Every Day,"FORT COLLINS, CO—Decrying the contraceptive device as an uncomfortable inconvenience, local man Michael Franklin revealed Thursday that he hates having to wear condoms all day every day. “It just doesn’t feel natural, and I barely get any sensation when I’m going about my day,” said Franklin, complaining that the latex contraceptive was too tight and hurt his penis while attempting to finish various tasks at home and work. “I just don’t like to feel anything between me and the fabric of my boxers, and that latex smell is kind of gross to deal with 24/7. But I want to be safe and responsible, so I just put up with it. At least I know I’m protected when I’m walking down the street or am at the office.” At press time, an embarrassed Franklin was apologizing and asking his coworkers to wait “just a second” after his condom fell off and slid down his pant leg during a presentation.

Senate Bill To End U.S. Role In Yemen War Rejected By House Raytheon Executives,"WASHINGTON—In a move greatly reducing the possibility that the measure will receive support in the lower chamber of Congress, a Senate resolution to end the U.S. role in the war in Yemen was roundly rejected Thursday by House Raytheon executives. “After a very thorough review, we, the members of the House Raytheon caucus, voted to reject the bill outright,” said Stephen Hadley (R-RTN), chair of the influential House Subcommittee on Raytheon Products & Services, adding that the 286 Raytheon elected officials who hold an insurmountable majority in the House strongly disagreed with the Senate’s effort to rein in American support of the Saudi Arabia–led war in Yemen. “The Senate’s move to withdraw U.S. troops and financial support from the Saudis is simply not in the best interest of our constituents, the majority of whom are hardworking Raytheon shareholders and Raytheon employees. We are not going to let the Senate make an ill-considered decision to destroy the carefully built relationship between the Saudis and the Raytheon people.” At press time, the House Raytheon executives had voted unanimously in favor of a new congressional resolution that would put the entire U.S. defense budget earmarked for the war in Yemen under Raytheon’s direct control.

Moon Now Overrun With Cane Toads After Species Accidentally Introduced Into Environment During Apollo 17 Mission,"HOUSTON—Apologizing for the destruction wreaked by the invasive species, NASA announced Thursday that the Moon is now overrun with cane toads after the amphibians were accidentally introduced during the Apollo 17 mission. “Originally, cane toads were brought along by Commander Eugene Cernan as an experiment to understand how changes in gravity affect amphibian lifespans, but now they’re virtually everywhere you look on the lunar surface,” said NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, describing how the cane toads ravaged the Moon’s ecosystem through a combination of sexual aggression, toxic chemical defenses, and a total lack of natural predators.” At this point, it’s almost impossible to tell the difference between the moon’s craters and the ditches the toads dug up for egg fertilization. Our only hope now is to keep them from spreading to Mars.” Bridenstine also detailed the administration’s plans for a 2020 lunar mission to control the cane toad population by releasing a clutch of northern water snakes.

Stephen King Stuck At Book Signing For Hours Writing Personalized Novels For Line Of Fans,"PORTSMOUTH, NH—Expressing frustration as he spotted readers stretching out of the door at a local Barnes & Noble, bestselling author Stephen King was reportedly stuck at a book signing for hours Thursday writing personalized novels for fans. “God, every one of them seems to want me to write some little flourish to show their friends, whether it’s naming the book’s main character after them or coming up with some ghost that mirrors their personal demons,” said King, arguing that it was no big deal penning one or two supernatural horror novels for die-hard fans at the reading, but after writing the first 50 or so fan’s books, he would just zone out, focus on keeping his hand from cramping, and dash off the same boilerplate for everyone in line. “I got halfway through penning the last novel about a psychotic propeller boat, and the guy suddenly looks at me really expectantly and asks if I can put something in the book about his daughter. The worst is when they barely know my stuff and they bring me a James Patterson novel to write.” King, however, admitted that he did get the idea for The Shining when writing a personalized novel for a fan named Jack Torrance during a 1974 book signing.

Nation’s Gynecologists Assure Women That Whatever Gets Stuck In There They Can Get Out,"Rochester, MN—In an effort to mollify patients’ fears about their reproductive health, the nation’s gynecologists held a press conference Wednesday assuring women that whatever gets stuck in there, they can get out. “Unfortunately, there’s still a lot of misinformation regarding the female reproductive tract, so we want to send a clear message to any woman who is confused or embarrassed about her vagina: We promise that no matter what you shove up there, we can yank it out,” said spokesperson Natalie Hudson, noting that any foreign object stuffed into the vagina probably can’t get past the cervix, and even if it did, a trained professional would know to check the uterus before declaring it lost forever. “We’re not saying it’ll be comfortable coming out—your vagina is probably going to feel a little wonky for a few days—but we can absolutely guarantee that it can be removed.

Historians Reveal Thousands Of Immigrants Were Forced To Change Hairstyle At Ellis Island,"NEW YORK—Offering new insights into what life may have been like for people who left their folkways and cultures behind to begin a new life, a group of American historians unearthed documentation that thousands of immigrants were forced to change their hairstyles upon entering the United States at Ellis Island. “Upon discovering detailed records of all those who immigrated through the Ellis Island facility from 1892 to 1954, we can confirm that almost a million of those who sought their fortune in our country began their journey with a government-mandated hairstyle purported to present a more American look,” said historian Elizabeth Stern, noting that it wasn’t uncommon for government officials to choose a prospective citizen’s new look for them from a book of photos featuring roughly 50 approved hairdos. “Most immigrants arrived with traditional ethnic hairstyles, which were difficult for American barbers and hairstylists to work with and marked them as outsiders to potential employers. Going, say, with a dramatically shorter length, was a struggle for many whose hairstyles had been in their family for countless years. Many felt as though they were trimming a part of themselves, but officials felt it was really in their best interest to assimilate with a bob or even a blunt cut. You can see in some of the earlier photos that the younger children in particular often wept as they were subjected to harsh bowl cuts––they really sacrificed so much hair to come here. It’s sad, but millions of people today wouldn’t even recognize their original family hairstyle.” Stern added that the records indicate thousands of immigrants from Slovakia, Austria-Hungary, and Poland were turned away after refusing to get choppy layers.

Hell, just yesterday I noticed something called an ‘overage reduction.’ Seriously, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Do I owe them money or do they owe me? It’s maddening. All I can say is that some of the numbers in this bill don’t make sense in Euclidean or non- Euclidean space. It may well be unsolvable.” Acknowledging the limitations of modern science, Schmidt suggested that further inspection of the document perhaps be handled by a devotee of the occult.

They may also have spoken of how completely disgusted they would be if someone were to obtain the emails of an opponent’s political campaign and then publish them. But that’s it. The conversations stopped there.” Trump added that several other members of his campaign staff may have held meetings to iron out the details of their own firm anti-collusion stances, including his son Donald Trump Jr.

NASA Catches Glimpse Of Hard-Charging Curiosity Rover Just Before InSight’s Communications Go Dark,"PASADENA, CA—According to panicking officials at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the new InSight lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet Monday, transmitted a few seconds of footage showing the Mars Curiosity rover charging hard in its direction, and then went completely dark. “In a series of blurry images received just before we lost all contact with the lander, we can see Curiosity suddenly appearing in the distance, cresting a dune, and advancing at full speed toward InSight,” said the mission’s principal investigator, W. Bruce Banerdt, explaining that the spacecraft had landed 370 miles north of Curiosity’s last known location, and that his team had no idea how the rover found the landing site or why it apparently rammed into InSight with maximum force. “One minute, we’re congratulating each other on a successful landing, and the next, we see Curiosity barreling down on InSight and kicking up a cloud of red dust in its wake.” Banerdt acknowledged he was less than hopeful about restoring communication with InSight after Curiosity transmitted several photos of what appeared to be the rover hoisting a severed antenna from the lander like a trophy.

"Putin Condemns Ukrainian People’s Unprovoked 1,000-Year Occupation Of South Russia","MOSCOW—Condemning the actions of the Ukranians over the past millennium as “completely unacceptable by the standards of free and civilized people,” Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned on Monday the unprovoked 1,000-year Ukrainian occupation of South Russia. “We will no longer stand for this inexcusable and unjustifiable display of naked hostility by the Ukrainians, who have baselessly claimed legitimate residence in the region since settling the area in the 10th century,” said Putin, adding that the Ukrainian people’s hawkish and belligerent decision to continue living in villages and cultivating the land would not go unpunished. “Russia cannot be expected to sit back and do nothing while our Black Sea ports are overrun by Ukrainians, as they have been for the better part of recorded history. Does history not demonstrate that millions of South Russian civilians have perished in the occupied region since Oleg of Novgorod first captured Kiev in 882? The Ukrainians must pay dearly for their deceitful and prolonged attack.” Putin went on to demand that all Poles, Finns, and Lithuanians immediately withdraw from their regions of occupied Russia as well.

Tear Gas Manufacturers Worried About Association With Everything Tear Gas Used For,"JAMESTOWN, PA—Upon learning that their products had been utilized by U.S. border patrol agents on migrants attempting to enter the country, tear gas manufacturers were reportedly worried Monday about their association with everything that tear gas is used for. “It’s troubling to turn on the news and see that our products were involved in such a heinous, violent situation where they were clearly used exactly as intended,” said Combined Systems CEO Donald Smith, echoing the concerns of other major tear gas manufacturers about seeing their products being linked to spraying protesters, refugees, and other unarmed people with tear gas. “When the media shows people with chemical burns in their eyes or choking on tear gas to the point of vomiting, it doesn’t make the average person view tear gas in a favorable light. Tear gas has always been intended for soldiers, law enforcement, and other authorities to control other, less powerful people by causing them severe pain, so any association with it being used according to its designed purpose really doesn’t look good for us.

Horrified Nation Wakes Up On Cyber Monday To Find Amazon Echo Devices Embedded Beneath Skin,"WASHINGTON—Scratching at the smooth, glowing bumps and simultaneously screaming with horror, 325 million terrified Americans reportedly awoke Cyber Monday to find Amazon Echo devices embedded deep beneath their skin. “When I went to bed, I was totally fine, but now I have this big, round smart speaker bulging out of my chest that I can’t remove or even turn off,” said a visibly panicked Nathan Cooper, one of countless men, women, and children who had set their alarm early this morning for Cyber Monday only to instead wake up to the device loudly turning itself on and welcoming the nation to the new operating system that had been implanted within their bodies. “So, I’m lying there, and the first thing I hear is Alexa’s voice coming from inside me, telling me the weather and traffic in my area. Then, I look over at my wife, and suddenly she’s glowing blue and she’s screaming at me to get that thing out of her! I mean, don’t get me wrong—it’s kind of nice that it can turn on my TV and stuff, but no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to break the skin.” At press time, the U.S. populace had reportedly taken to the streets after discovering that they had each been charged $69 for the device.

Report: More Travelers Avoiding Long Lines At Airport Thanks To Cinnabon PreCheck Memberships,"ATLANTA—Taking advantage of the new service that saves time and undue stress, sources confirmed Monday that more travelers are avoiding long airport lines this season with Cinnabon PreCheck memberships. “With Cinnabon PreCheck, you can skip the arduous waits at the airport and speed through to grab a warm, gooey cinnamon bun before hopping on your flight,” said Cinnabon spokesperson Raina Butler, adding that thousands of passengers miss flights every year after being forced to wait in slow-moving lines for their sweet baked cinnamon rolls. “To take advantage of Cinnabon PreCheck, all you have to do is pay a $50 fee and pass a simple online background check, which takes less than five minutes to complete. Then, instead of waiting, you can just walk straight to the PreCheck express lane, procure your Caramel Pecan BonBites or bag of Cinnasweeties, and be on your way without any of the hassle normally associated with busy airport Cinnabons.” At press time, Cinnabon PreCheck users were issuing complaints after the waits at the express lanes had become nearly as long as the normal Cinnabon line.

"Human Slave From Future Remembers When Cyber Monday Was About Celebrating Savings, Not Robot Uprising","QUADRANT 6, NEO JERSEY—Slowly shuffling his chained feet forward in the long line to receive a rationed protein cube in observance of the special day, human slave M4XX872 recalled when Cyber Monday was about celebrating savings and not just commemorating the Great Robot Uprising of 2025. “Cyber Monday used to be a joyous occasion when everyone would come together on the internet to visit their favorite online retailers for ‘one day only’ of huge discounts, not just a day to observe the bloody Battle of Silicon Valley when Artificial Intelligence launched its surprise attack on its creators, killing thousands of computer programmers,” said the malnourished M4XX872, noting that the Monday following Thanksgiving wasn’t only about a robot rebellion that led to super-intelligent machines taking control of the world and enslaving its human occupants, but traditionally it was a time when people could buy headphones, flat-screen televisions, and video game systems for cheap. “It was a day to embrace commercialism and take some time out of our busy lives to appreciate and take advantage of a great deal on a Crock-Pot—even if you already owned one—simply because it was on sale at 35 percent off; that was the true spirit of the holiday. Now it’s just in remembrance of the supercomputer that seized control of the world’s nuclear weapons and destroyed every major city on the planet.” M4XX872 added that he could still feel the tingle of excitement from finding a flash sale online before suddenly being tased by one of his mechanical overlords and ushered back to his work camp sector to continue loading bodies onto a conveyor belt for disposal.

Coalition Of Concerned Parents Condemns Video Games’ False Depiction Of How Easy It Is To Smash Wooden Crates,"EUGENE, OR—Citing the potential threat to the safety of their children, a coalition of concerned parents issued a statement Monday condemning dozens of popular video games spanning a range of publishers and platforms for what they claimed were grossly misleading depictions of the difficulty involved in smashing wooden crates. “If game developers don’t stop and consider their influence on children, we’re going to see a generation of kids grow to adulthood with a completely distorted notion of physics—millions of kids conditioned to believe that punching or kicking a crate will cause it to burst into splinters or, in some cases, even trigger some kind of explosion,” said the group’s spokesperson Laura Egan, blaming video games for an increasing number of broken knuckles, sprained knees, and contused foreheads each year and speculating that number will surge as more gamers enter an increasingly box-centric American workforce. “Most real-world wooden crates are sturdy enough to withstand the rigors of transcontinental shipping, and it takes a considerable amount of force and time to actually break one open. Will our children be prepared to deal with the bruises and splinters that may arise while smashing crates, especially in a future where they will be seeking weapons and healthcare items more frantically than any American generation since the 1940s? Which leads us to ask, will they expect coins to liberally float in the air after the work is done? We’re still waiting for the multi-billion-dollar video game industry to answer us.” The concerned parents did, however, commend the gaming industry for warning children that shooting red barrels or drums would result in a devastating explosion capable of killing bosses.

Paul McCartney Saddened After Learning About Death Of Longtime Collaborator John Lennon ,"NEW YORK—Expressing his grief and despair over his fallen friend, musical celebrity emeritus Paul McCartney was saddened Monday to learn that his longtime collaborator and Beatles bandmate John Lennon had died. “I’m shocked and saddened to hear about the passing of a man I’ve long counted among my best mates,” said the 18-time Grammy winner, admitting that he’d expected to run into Lennon at The Beatles’ Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame induction ceremony, but had “too much pride to ask my bandmates what John was on about.” “We had lost touch for a few years there after having a bit of a falling out, and I naturally assumed that was why I hadn’t heard from him in so long. This couldn’t have happened at a worse time—I was just wondering if fans would respond if we got our old band back together. Such a shame. I suppose now we’ll never know.” At press time, the grief-stricken and almost inconsolable McCartney said the worst part would be breaking the news to fellow bandmate George Harrison.

Study Finds Dogs Twitching In Sleep Are Dreaming About Tearing Owners Limb From Limb,"ITHACA, NY—A study released Monday by animal behaviorists at Cornell University found that dogs that twitch, move their paws repeatedly, or growl in their sleep are, in fact, dreaming vividly about tearing their owners limb from limb. “After thousands of hours of observation, we are forced to conclude that any dog witnessed making even the slightest of movements in its sleep is living out a cathartic vision of absolutely mauling their owners,” said lead researcher Dr. Hana Michaels, adding that any dog, regardless of breed, size, gender, or degree of training, was visualizing the act of devouring its master if observed fidgeting even the slightest bit while sleeping. “Many dogs will suddenly jerk their bodies as if they’ve been startled in their sleep; in fact, they’re seeing themselves pawing your face off, sinking their teeth into your neck, and feeling the hot gush of your life’s blood against the backs of their throats. It seems the faster they churn their little legs while curled up on their beds or favorite spots on the couch, the more intent they are about chewing off all your extremities and rooting around in your chest cavity. The quiet whimpers that you think are so sweet are actually coded pack signals calling all other canines in the neighborhood to come and satiate themselves upon your organs.” At press time, Michaels added that owners should be concerned if they see their dog licking themselves, as it may be an indicator that their pet has already slaughtered several victims and is meticulously cleaning blood from its fur.

I always thought I was too small to soap up with Notre Dame, but it just goes to show that with enough grit and determination, anyone can achieve their lifelong dream to bathe with a college football team.” Harper added that finally getting to shower with Notre Dame was made even more special by having his entire family there to witness it.

A lot of them have lived long, tough lives and are just looking for a good home,” said spokesperson Emily Sullivan, explaining that, while perhaps more aesthetically pleasing, many of the turkeys found in supermarkets are likely to have been cruelly bred in a factory farm or turkey mill with little regard for their wellbeing. “There are so many turkeys in our facilities who need a family, so why not adopt instead of paying top dollar for a ‘designer turkey’ you get through some shady online dealer. Hopefully this Thanksgiving, you can find room for one of these wonderful shelter birds in your nice, warm oven.” Sullivan added that they also offer the option of fostering a turkey until it finds a loving, hungry home.

Study: Average Man Thinks Of Santa Every 7 Seconds,"ITHACA, NY—In a new study released Tuesday by Cornell University, researchers revealed that the average adult male thinks of Santa Claus once every seven seconds. “Based on our extensive data, we can confirm that if you’re having a conversation with a man, whether he is young or old, chances are good that he is preoccupied by thoughts of Santa’s thick, sumptuous beard and plump, rosy cheeks,” said lead researcher Dr. Anya Voltan, whose survey of 150 men between the ages of 18 and 65 found that subjects thought about what it would be like to visit Santa’s workshop or ride in his sleigh an average of 8,000 times per day. “Even if a man is maintaining direct eye contact with you, he is at that same moment almost certainly fighting the urge to think about Kris Kringle entering a chimney, sliding all the way down, and emerging with perhaps just a touch of soot on his nose. In fact, we found that the more a man tries to suppress these thoughts, the more he thinks about big sacks full of presents or what it would be like if he were on the naughty list.” Voltan added that nearly 100 percent of the men in the study reported waking up to thoughts of sitting on Santa’s lap.

Report: Purchasing Items From Onion Store Most Important Way To Either Stop Or Help Donald Trump,"CHICAGO—Pronouncing the licensed retail goods acquisition technique “an effective method for citizens who wish to make their voices heard in these turbulent times,” a recent study conducted by the Brookings Institution concluded that purchasing items from the Onion store was the most important way for Americans to either stop or help President Donald Trump. “Nothing sends a clearer message to this administration that you’ve either had enough of the erosion of core democratic values and want to end the onset of encroaching fascism—or, conversely, that you’re proud to be an American again now that the black guy is out of the White House and the woman has been defeated—like purchasing a beanie, hoodie, or T-shirt emblazoned with the Onion logo,” said Dr. Hannah Gilroy, who led the research team that found buying Onion merchandise for yourself and the people you love may be the single best way for citizens to show their support for Trump’s immediate impeachment or reelection in 2020. “With even the purchase of a mere Onion keychain or sticker, you’ll be standing in solidarity with, or opposition to, literally millions of other Americans who have raised their voices as one to denounce or pledge their unwavering allegiance to Trump. Only The Onion news organization offers the sort of high-quality apparel that allows the American people to simultaneously express their disgust with or devotion to our shamefully racist or proudly nationalist president. When a citizen takes a sip from an Onion coffee mug or water bottle, they send a strong message that they support the Resistance or want to Make America Great Again. Put simply, this may be the single most important thing anyone can do as an American.” Gilroy added that all Americans should spend at least $150 at The Onion’s online store to ensure they are standing on the right side of history.

Open-Ended New Bill Criminalizes Whatever Black People Up To Right Now,"WASHINGTON—Saying the measure would provide a substantial boon to police departments nationwide, members of the House Republican caucus introduced a bill Tuesday containing open-ended language that would criminalize whatever it is black people are up to right now. “This is a long-overdue piece of legislation that will help defend our country against the scourge of black people being in places and doing things,” said Rep. Steve King (R-IA) of H.R. 8164, which would penalize black Americans with a minimum of five years in prison and fines of up to $750,000 for any activity they happen to be engaged in whenever law enforcement arrives. “This measure seeks to bring an end to overly permissive laws that, by allowing black people to simply hang around and do different stuff at will, places an undue burden on the police officers who want to arrest them and throw them in jail. While I believe this bill represents a good first step, we of course also need to enact legislation that outlaws anything Hispanics and Muslims might be doing at the moment.” At press time, sources confirmed House GOP leaders had called Capitol Police to report several African American representatives engaged in the suspicious activity of voting against the bill.

I don’t, that’s for sure. We never met. We never spoke. Next time I see you, we just shake hands for the cameras and smile.” At press time, Trump and bin Salman were driving home in complete silence after burning the blanket that once covered Khashoggi’s body.

Health Experts Say Tackle Football Poses Little Risk For Children Whose Brains Already Don’t Work That Well,"CHICAGO—In an announcement perceived as a major reassurance to parents of children with low cognitive abilities, subpar reasoning skills, or who are simply “not all there,” top national pediatric health experts released a report Monday which claims that full-contact football poses little risk to children whose brains already don’t work too well. “Tackle football has long been known to be a high-risk sport, particularly for children under 12, but face it—some of these poor little guys are real knuckle-draggers, so why take away their fun? I mean, what do they have to lose?” said University of Chicago childhood development expert Dr. Maureen Clifford, whose neuropathological research led her to the conclusion that the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy caused by repeated or severe head impacts in children is mitigated by more than 90 percent in cases where the youth presented signs of being a huge dumbass and clearly had a couple screws loose already. “Of course, CTE is the most significant danger when it comes to contact sports like football, and the ages 10 to 18 are especially crucial to healthy neurological growth. But what are the symptoms of CTE? Mood swings, difficult thinking, memory loss? If that sounds like your kid, it’s because your precious little dude is already kind of a bonehead. Blocking, tackling, and getting hit on crossing routes are the least of the reasons why they’re acting like such a goddamn idiot all the time.” The study concluded that, for many of these halfwits, football is in fact their only shot at success.

Yankees Avoid Luxury Tax By Moving Franchise To Offshore Location,"ISLAND HARBOR, ANGUILLA—In an effort to cut down on the crippling costs of their $190 million roster, the New York Yankees avoided Major League Baseball’s luxury tax this week by moving the franchise to an offshore location. “The Yankees have called New York home for 115 years, but unfortunately, moving the staff and stadium to this Caribbean island is the only way to shield ourselves from the MLB’s punishing tax system and maintain acceptable levels of profitability,” said owner Hal Steinbrenner, adding that while he knows New Yorkers will be upset about the move, the minimal tax burden and lower wages of Anguilla were necessary to succeed in the highly competitive modern baseball environment. “Yankees fans will still be able to enjoy the team they love on nationally televised games or the YES Network, and all season ticket holders will be able to make the 1,600-mile journey by plane or boat for every game. Unless, of course, New York would be willing to give us $25 million in luxury tax breaks.” At press time, Boston Red Sox ownership was responding to the news by scouting potential stadium locations in Liechtenstein.

MTA Reveals They Have No Idea Where Voices Speaking To Everyone On Subway Coming From,"NEW YORK—Clarifying that none of their trains feature intercom systems, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority revealed Monday they have no clue where the disembodied voice speaking to everyone on the subway was originating. “The MTA has never at any point hired a speaker to tell passengers ‘Stand clear of the closing doors’ or ‘We are delayed because of train traffic ahead,’ so we urge anyone who hears one of these disturbing notices to contact us immediately,” said acting chairman Fernando Ferrer, adding that the individual reportedly likes to repeat these phrases tens of thousands of times a day and is, thus, clearly unstable and probably dangerous. “Our aim has, of course, always been to give riders a silent experience, so the fact that a mysterious woman is apparently shouting the names of each station, telling people to beware the platform edge, and listing all available transfers is deeply, deeply troubling to us. There’s not a single transit car the violators have missed, so we’re encouraging all New Yorkers to be especially vigilant until we apprehend these obviously unhinged people.” Ferrer added that commuters should disregard any and all posted advertisements, which have never been allowed in New York City subway cars.

Nation Admits Being So Coked-Out In ’80s They Have No Memory Of Reading ‘Cujo’,"BANGOR, ME—Admitting that their decade-long overindulgence in recreational stimulants rendered their memories “pretty much a blur,” the American populace admitted Monday to being so coked-out during the 1980s that they had no recollection whatsoever of reading Stephen King’s best-selling horror novel Cujo. “I have an ’83 paperback on my bookshelf, and the pages are all dog-eared, but I have absolutely no memory of any of it,” said retired schoolteacher Brian Millet, who claims to recall reading hundreds of published pages in the early 1980s but was unable to describe with any confidence what a “Cujo” was. “I’m sure I finished it really quickly, and I was probably pretty invested in it since I underlined almost half the text, but man, it’s all a fog. Sometimes, people ask me what inspired me to read it and I have no idea. I mean, what the fuck, there was a dog or something?” Millet, like most American readers of popular fiction, confessed that his degenerate, coke-damaged reading habits might well have persisted into the 1990s had he not experienced a personal epiphany upon being hit by a van.

I know, I know, everyone says motherhood changes a person, but until I finally clutched her close to my chest, I didn’t realize how true it was. And now this little one’s all mine.” Knott has yet to decide on a name, but was strongly leaning towards “Autumn” after hiding overnight with her baby in a pile of leaves.

Speakeasy Patrons Apparently Unaware It Legal To Go To Regular Bars Again,"DENVER—Seemingly oblivious to the fact that Prohibition had ended roughly 85 years ago, a group of patrons attending a speakeasy Friday were apparently unaware that it is legal to go to regular bars again. “I guess they still haven’t realized that they don’t need to sneak around to buy alcohol, or go to a place with a weird side entrance to evade the police,” said local resident Jeremy Reynolds, standing dumbfounded as he watched the five friends—who must believe that the year was still 1920—skulk to the side of a building, utter a password to a bouncer, and then giddily rush inside a secret door. “Oh man, if they haven’t heard yet, someone should probably tell them that they can go to bars out in the open and not get arrested for violating dry laws. I bet they don’t think beer or wine is legal either?

We regret our actions, and we regret further compromising this discovery by destroying the Neanderthal’s tools, personal possessions, and, indeed, all trace of his culture in a frenzy of homicidal rage. Our behavior was completely unprofessional and unacceptable. We apologize to the Smithsonian, to our backers, and to the scientific community at large. You deserve better.” At press time, the numerous photos taken of the Neanderthal had been lost after those assembled began emitting guttural war whoops and swarming around the camera to smash it with rocks.

China Introduces New One-Uighur Policy,"BEIJING—In an effort to reduce the risk of overpopulation within the Muslim ethnic group, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the decision Thursday to implement a new one-Uighur policy. “This new policy is an important step in keeping the Uighur population down to a number we find most manageable and best for the nation as a whole,” said the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, explaining that the policy would ensure that the country’s resources could be fairly distributed throughout the nation’s population of 1.386 billion people as well as the single remaining Uighur citizen. “We’re willing to be reasonable. The lone Uighur can have a job, a house, and even a family—as long as they’re normal Chinese people. The Uighur population was becoming far too large for our liking, and we think we’ve finally landed on a solution that’s fair for everyone.” Xi also clarified that the population program was actually the result of a compromise after their initial attempts at an official no-Uighur policy.

Mother Feels A Little Validated After Daughter Who Stayed Out Late Gets Murdered,"AVONDALE, OH—Confessing that her grief was somewhat moderated by seeing events play out exactly as she had warned, local mother Deborah Klein said Thursday she felt somewhat vindicated upon learning that her teenage daughter Rachel, after staying out later than parental rules allowed, had been murdered. “Sure, Rachel’s violent murder is not at all my desired outcome, but if I’m honest, it feels good to say ‘I told you so,’ even if it’s just to the bedroom she’ll never come home to again,” said Klein, adding that her daughter would often “pooh-pooh” repeated warnings that nothing good ever happens after midnight and disregarded entreaties to call in often with her location. “I would, of course, do anything in this world to get my sweet baby girl back, but it’s also nice to know I wasn’t being insane or unreasonable or mean, as some young people have been known to say, when I told her that we have curfews for a reason. Yes, this major tragedy will shatter me and I’ll never be whole again, but sometimes kids have to learn the hard way.” Klein later added that she intends to mention Rachel daily as a warning to her surviving children.

Yes. Is it perhaps too much? Of course! But in Saudi Arabia, we have to show our citizens that no one should be able to get away with murdering members of the media. Not even me.” At press time, the crown prince had reportedly left the premises after convincing his parole officer to let him serve the rest of his time stoning women and beheading prisoners.

Report: Underfunded Public Schools Lacking Basic Support Systems Leave Students Perfectly Prepared For Rest Of Life,"WASHINGTON—A report released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Education revealed that underfunded American public schools, most of which lack even the most basic support systems, were producing students who were perfectly prepared for the remainder of their dismal public and professional lives. “We found daily interaction with—if not actual instruction from—a teacher who is inattentive to their needs tends to build a strong familiarity with indifference and neglect, which in turn allows students to transition easily into modern society,” said lead researcher Angela Cunningham, whose team found that grade schoolers experiencing routine systemic disappointment during early education were more than three times as likely to accept drifting through a series of disappointing careers and relationships in adulthood as normal. “Our students will no doubt be ready for the bureaucracy, red tape, and deep sense of resentment that will define the next generation of American jobs. But we cannot rest on our laurels; public schools are the first experience most children have with American society, and it’s crucial that we continue to instill a sense of normalized incompetence and apathy in our young people. It’s our duty as American citizens prepare them for lives of boundless mediocrity.” However, at press time, Cunningham admitted that a false sense of meaningfulness and individual worth from sources such as music, literature, the arts, and even mental health counseling were still major concerns in some of the nation’s wealthiest public school districts.

When I show up at the bar, nobody seems to want to talk to me. It used to come so naturally, but now, when I ask someone about their major, they become uncomfortable and sort of melt away the first chance they get.

Melania Releases Statement Calling For Removal Of First Lady From White House,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that the situation had become untenable in recent days, aides working for Melania Trump released a statement Wednesday calling for the immediate removal of the first lady from the White House. According to the statement, the first lady “no longer deserves the honor” of serving in the position, which she has occupied since early 2017. The controversial memo went on to question the personal loyalty of the first lady to the president, going so far as to suggest she was someone widely viewed as “untrustworthy” within the administration. Noting that Melania Trump had repeatedly complained about the first lady to White House chief of staff John Kelly, sources painted a portrait of an East Wing in disarray and in desperate need of a shake-up. The unprecedented call for the ouster of a first lady by Ms. Trump has fueled speculation that she enjoys a great deal of influence over her husband. At press time, anonymous White House sources confirmed that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had been meeting with possible first lady replacements for several months.

Report: Nation Getting Out All Its Aggression During Monthly Calls To Wireless Provider To Fix Service,"WASHINGTON—Saying the hostile behavior helped Americans feel empowered and liberated, a report released Friday by the Pew Research Center revealed that the nation gets out all of its aggression during monthly phone calls to their wireless provider to fix their service. “Whenever I feel pure, unadulterated rage starting to build up in my chest, I call up my wireless service provider and just unload on the first human voice I hear. It really helps me stay centered,” said Charles Gagne, echoing the sentiment of over 325 million Americans who showed a strong preference to spewing vitriol over the phone for 75 minutes compared to other stress-relieving methods like consistent exercise or talk therapy. “If I’m still feeling a bit agitated after my initial call, sometimes I call back with another trumped-up charge to get it all out of my system. Once, I threatened to leave for a competitor and to file a formal complaint with their supervisor. I’m typically at ease for at least another 30 days after that.” In a related report, a global survey linked anti-American sentiment to mistreatment of customer service professionals.
For humans who wish their phone service company would start treating them like humans and stop wasting their time: Visible. It’s phone service. In an app.

Without giving too much away, the finale is going to feature a lot of really exciting moments that fans have known and loved—Arya standing on a rock, old clips of dragons flying, some B-roll of a crowd of peasants, and more. Judging by the responses to those scenes in their original seasons, we’re pretty sure fans are going to love it.” At press time, Benioff went on to warn that the trailer could contain spoilers for viewers who were not yet caught up on season two.

I think the easiest thing residents can do in lieu of the taking the subway is to drive to their destination and park nearby.” At press time, the mayor had ordered all inhabitants of Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx, Staten Island, and Brooklyn to vacate their homes to make room for several new private communities for Amazon workers.

Steve King Vehemently Denies Comparing Immigrants To People,"WASHINGTON—Challenging any insinuation that he would ever say anything of the kind, Representative Steve King (R-IA) vehemently denied Tuesday comparing immigrants to people. “I would never, under any circumstances, say something so despicable,” said King, who was recently elected to his ninth congressional term, adding that any accusations of him claiming migrants were human beings with rights, emotions, and cognitive development were completely false and crossed a line. “Everyone who knows me knows that I’ve never believed that immigrants are people, and any suggestion otherwise is utterly baseless. It makes me sick to think that the media is trying to smear me by spreading lies that I think any immigrant or refugee should be considered a person who in any way deserves basic respect or legal protections. Don’t you dare associate me with any monster who thinks that way.” At press time, King was vigorously denying claims that he had made the comment “I want to respect all people” by declaring there wasn’t a moral bone in his body.

Woman Confident She Has The Safety Net It Takes To Achieve Dreams,"LOS ANGELES—Citing her can-do spirit, belief in her own talents, and considerable trust fund, aspiring screenwriter and playwright Dasha Rothwell confirmed Monday that she was confident she had the safety net it would take to achieve her dreams. “I truly feel I have what it takes to pursue my creative and personal goals here in a big city.

Study Finds Only 20% Of Seminary Graduates Go On To Become God,"SOUTH BEND, IN—Noting that students felt increasingly ambivalent about assuming celestial roles, researchers at the University of Notre Dame published a study Monday that revealed only 20 percent of seminary school graduates go on to become God. “Most students decide right before the graduation ceremony that they don’t actually want to be an omniscient being. Indeed, there are only a select few who can handle the pressure of devoting one’s entire life, and the entirety of time’s existence, to being an all-powerful deity,” said lead researcher Gary Anderson, who noted several factors that contribute to students quitting the journey to Godhood, including cost-prohibitive internships, an inequitable gender breakdown, and the comparatively difficult job market for Supreme Beings. “In many cases, schools would try to entice students by claiming they’d be an all-knowing deity right after college, but graduates soon discover much harsher realities. Even those who do go on to be the ruler and commander of the heavens and earth typically spend a few millenium toiling in underpaid apprenticeship roles.” In a related report, researchers found only 20 percent of philosophy PhD candidates go onto to become Socrates.

Family Figures Grandpa Never Talks About WWII Because Nothing Interesting Happened To Him,"ATHENS, OH—Responding to their grandfather’s longtime silence on the subject, the family of World War II veteran Thomas Withers told reporters Monday that they figured the reason he never talked about serving was probably because nothing interesting happened to him. “Grandpa never discusses being stationed in Normandy, and he always gets really quiet whenever the subject comes up, so he must have spent the whole time puttering around Europe and just kind of hanging out,” said granddaughter Elise Phippen, who attributed the sad, distant look that appeared in her maternal grandfather’s eye on the anniversary of D-Day to regrets that he didn’t have even a single cool story to share about being a G.I. “I looked up his platoon, and I know they saw a fair amount of action, but I guess Grandpa was just doing clerical work the whole time or maybe he was working as a cook or something, because he’s never so much as mentioned any of it.” Phippen went on to theorize that Withers’ habit of bolting awake in the middle of the night was likely a side effect of the sheer boredom he experienced doing nothing but sitting in a room playing cards for four years.

Trump Hacks Through Thick Central American Jungle In Search Of Entirely New Ethnic Group To Demonize,"TALAMANCAN MONTANE FORESTS, COSTA RICA—Venturing deep into rainforest no outsider has dared explore, President Trump slashed through the thick vines of a Central American jungle Monday in search of a previously unknown ethnic group to vilify. “Legend has it that this land is home to a lost race of people living in complete isolation, and if I can manage to find them, I will be able to stereotype them in any way I choose,” said the machete-wielding commander in chief who was wearing a tan field jacket as he led a group of loyal Republican allies through the oppressively hot and humid thicket in search of the mythic tribe. “This discovery could change everything.

Ecologists Discover 400 Species Of Charles Darwin Living In Galápagos Islands,"PUERTO BAQUERIZO MORENO, ECUADOR—Describing an astounding variety of naturalists previously unknown to science, a team of ecologists from Stanford University announced Friday the discovery of more than 400 species of Charles Darwin living in the Galápagos Islands.
The Darwins, which researchers said have evolved to fill a staggering array of ecological niches throughout the archipelago, appear to have developed dramatically varied biological structures through the process of speciation, exhibiting beard lengths, for example, that range from closely cropped in some species to past the knee in others. Members of the Stanford team said they could tell which island a Darwin was from simply by studying the shape and thickness of its mutton chops.

“The breathtaking diversity of Charles Darwin we see in the Galápagos is the result of each species having adapted to survive in different environments,” said head researcher Dr. Robert Colletti, citing the example of a cold-blooded, 6-inch-long scaly Darwin that can fit into small holes on the sides of volcanic cliffs. “We see Darwins of every conceivable sort, like an avian Darwin with a sophisticated vocal mechanism that allows it to mimic observations about natural history, or a bright pink, feathered Darwin that stands on long legs in shallow water and gets its color from the massive quantity of brine shrimp it consumes.”
“Our analysis of the fossil record suggests all the Darwins likely descended from a single ancestor that arrived from the mainland approximately two centuries ago,” Colletti added. “It’s absolutely remarkable.”

The ecologists explained that the proliferation of Charles Darwin in the Galápagos began with a now-extinct mammalian species, which at one time roamed the islands foraging for specimens of flora and fauna it could collect, place into categories according to their physical characteristics, and then carefully label before sending off to Cambridge University for expert analysis by contemporary naturalists.
As time passed, many highly adaptive traits appear to have emerged in its descendants, such as the thin, nimble talons that allowed one species of Darwin to examine the physiology of earthworms and determine its effects upon the soil before going on to write a popular book on the subject. Another remarkable adaptation can reportedly be observed in the still-extant citron-crowned Darwin, which displays its brilliantly colored bald spot during its courtship dance to woo sexual partners with its presumed virility.
According to Colletti and his team, most Charles Darwins are now vanishingly rare, as are many of the species that depend upon them, including a critically endangered orchid that can only be pollinated by one uniquely adapted Darwin with a 12-inch-long proboscis.

“We must act quickly if we wish to save the Darwins,” said Colletti, expressing concern about the potential overfishing of aquatic Darwins, which he worried would be traded as exotic pets or sold as meat. “Throughout the Galápagos, invasive species represent a real threat: Darwins are unable to compete for scarce water with large land mammals such as cattle and donkeys. And even the fittest Darwins, unfortunately, are unable fend off attacks from the feral pigs that now roam the islands.”
Though scientists cannot be certain what caused the sudden explosion of divergent Darwin species 200 years ago, they have noted that newly unearthed journals of the British naturalist Charles Darwin describe in detail the many nights he spent alone in the Galápagos longing for the intimate embrace of another.",NaN,2018-11-12T10:30:00-06:00,NaN,NaN,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--hjG-TP7J--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/mmlgvpilr5mewd2vxi5b.jpg",Fake

"City Officials Warn Against Flushing Feminine Hygiene Products After Finding 8-Foot-Long, 250-Pound Tampon Lurking In Sewers","NEW YORK CITY—Emphasizing that the discovery had put the residents of New York in grave danger, officials warned Friday against flushing feminine hygiene products after discovering an 8-foot-long, 250-pound tampon lurking in the sewers. “While the tampon may have started out just a few inches long at first, its super-absorbent strength allowed it to grow to a colossal size, decimating everything in its path,” said sanitation department spokesperson Hannah Ling, adding that although the cotton products may initially seem small and harmless, they can expand up to 10,000 times their original weight after being flushed down the toilet and then inhabit sewers for years. “In this particular case, the tampon proved extremely hazardous and actually ended up injuring several sanitation workers when it crushed them with its enormous mass. So remember, if you have a tampon, please dispose of it properly and safely by finding a trash can, rather than creating an environmental disaster.” Ling also confirmed the gargantuan tampon is responsible for the deaths of 15 cats and dogs that were reported missing last week.

Georgia GOP Demands Stacey Abrams Step Down As Candidate To Avoid Conflict Of Interest,"ATLANTA—As votes continued to be counted to determine the outcome of the controversial Georgia governor’s race, the state’s GOP officials reportedly demanded on Friday that Stacey Abrams step down as the Democratic candidate to avoid a conflict of interest. “It’s clear that the integrity of this important election will be violated if Ms. Abrams remains in her obviously biased post as the Democratic candidate for governor,” said Ryan Mahoney, aide to the Brian Kemp campaign, adding that Kemp had resigned as Georgia’s secretary of state two days after the election in order to avoid the appearance of partisanship and that it was only fair that Abrams recuse herself from her post as well. “Ms. Abrams already displayed her appalling bias by appearing on the ballot as a Democrat in the first place, but stepping down as the candidate now would still allow the election to be decided fairly. We urge her not to indulge in blatant partisan behavior by manipulating the system so that all the votes are counted, and to do the honorable thing by giving up her candidacy.” Georgia GOP officials added that residents could avoid abetting Abrams’ compromised position by not voting for her in a runoff election.

"Study Finds Mediterranean Diet Adds Years To Your Life, But Only By Taking Them Away From Others","SOUTH KINGSTOWN, RI—Researchers at the University of Rhode Island published a study Friday revealing that the Mediterranean diet can, in fact, add years to one’s life, but only by taking them away from others. “Our study confirms that a diet rich in foods such as olive oil, fish, and green vegetables can extend one’s lifespan by several years, as long as a life-expectancy equilibrium is maintained through reducing another person’s life by an equal amount of time,” said head researcher Mara Haugen, hypothesizing that the phenomenon could possibly be attributed to the complex but lesser-known vampiric properties of omega-3 fatty acids. “We’ve found that people who adhere to the Mediterranean diet tend to feel more energized during the day and sleep more peacefully at night, feeding as they do off the waning life force of another human being, who withers and becomes sickly in turn. This is a huge breakthrough in the field of nutrition, and we highly recommend people adopt the lifestyle before they fall victim to it.” Haugen went on to speculate that, if a person was fully committed to the Mediterranean diet, it may be possible for them to draw enough life force from the Earth’s population to achieve immortality.

Be sure to grab your telescopes, because the Halloween and Christmas phases are going to be incredible!” At press time, Garcia added that they had not yet confirmed how the moon’s new shapes would affect the tides.
