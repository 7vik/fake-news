", United Airlines pilot and copilot fired for having loud sex together during flight," 49-year old Jordan McPhee and 38-year old Bayani Ceniza were operating a Boeing 747 carrying 412 passengers from Manilla to Los Angeles when the speakers in the plane’s passenger area started emitting strange noises.
 71-year old Betty Garrison who was aboard with her husband, says that both flight attendants and passengers were shocked when the unidentifiable sounds turned into “a gay porn soundtrack”.
 According to Ms. Garrison, flight attendants rapidly ran to the cockpit to warn the pilots, but the two ignored them and continued for several minutes before finally answering the door.
 Over 30 passengers filed complaints with United Airlines upon their arrival in Los Angeles and the company decided to act swiftly.
 In a brief press conference held in Chicago this morning, the airline has announced that it had launched an investigation on the event and that both Mr. Mcphee and Mr. Ceniza had been fired.
 United Airlines executive vice-president James Garreth claims the company will investigate the incident thoroughly and do everything it can to prevent such a thing from happening again.
 Over 300 incidents of sexual nature involving airplane pilots are reported every year in North America according to the FAA.
 A vast majority of these cases involve pilots engaging in sexual intercourse with flight attendants or passengers, and cases involving both pilot and co-pilot are extremely rare.
 In 2013, four employees of American Airlines had been fired after engaging in group sex with 17 passengers.

  “At first, we heard strange sounds and thought someone had entered the cockpit and was wrestling the pilots. But then it became clearer and we heard stuff like “fuck me harder Daddy” and other disgusting things.”
 

 “We could clearly hear the poor girls yelling and banging the door and the two men complaining about it while they continued having sex.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/costa-rica-american-tourist-arrested-for-having-sex-with-endangered-sea-turtles/
", Costa Rica: American tourist arrested for having sex with endangered sea turtles," Local video surveillance cameras showed Robert W. Schlong, an American tourist, sexually molesting the endangered sea turtle which has now been transported to an animal refuge.
 Tortuguero Police arrested Robert W. Schlong after several hotel employees reported the man having sex with multiple sea turtles over a two-week period.
 Manuel Rivera Castro, a hotel employee where Robert W. Schlong was residing, said locals called him the “Tortuga Amante” or “turtle lover” because of the tourist’s well-known sexual appetite for the endangered species.
 Local biologist Annamaria Sanchez believes that even though the sex acts are “incredibly disturbing,” they are even more dangerous, and could possibly be deadly for the turtles.
 Tortuguero Police later released Robert W. Schlong on a
  ₡
 120,000 bail (approx. $200 USD) until his trial and under strict conditions where he is not allowed to approach any sea turtle at less than 500 meters.
 Costa Rican law establishes penalties of jail time ranging from three months to a year for harming an animal in a debilitating form or for bestiality.

  “We asked him if he wanted a girl to spend the night with, but he said no and pointed to the ocean. He said he preferred the turtles,” one hotel employee told local reporters.
 

 
  “He would grab a turtle and push it over on its back and then he would climb on top of it and do his thing,” hotel employee Manuel Castro told Canal 13, visibly amused.
 

 
  “Performing vaginal or anal sex on a sea turtle could also permanently injure the creature and cause internal bleeding,” she warns.

 Being under a restraining order that forbade him from contacting or approaching his ex, he began an extreme transformation in order to do it without getting caught.
 He legally changed his name to Jason Monroe, underwent 37 plastic surgeries to change his physical appearance and even had a delicate vocal cords operation to alter his voice.
 Sarah Lopez, Mr. Mack’s ex-girlfriend, says she had no idea it was him when she “met him” at her gym.
 Ms. Franklin says it was wonderful for a few weeks, but that she gradually started to feel that there was something wrong about her new boyfriend.
 As soon as she recognized him, she called the police and he ran away, He was finally arrested less than 30 minutes later while hiding in bushes a few blocks from there.
 His ex-girlfriend, 34-year old Sarah Lopez, says it took almost five weeks before she recognized him.
 Mr. Monroe was arrested and imprisoned for a restraining order violation, but several other criminal charges could be filed against him.
 He already faces up to three years in county jail and up to $10,000 in fines, but the could also face charges of criminal harassment according to the Camden County Police Department.

 Dolly Callahan, 44, allegedly became furious after she found her son masturbating to homosexual pornographic material.
 Sheriff Ken Cloverfield said the woman told officers that she had punished her son so that he would understand that the choice of being gay comes with “heavy consequences” and “God’s disapproval.”
 Dolly Callahan was “highly intoxicated” after inhaling butane gas and lying on the floor when police arrived, according to the affidavit.
 The Department of Child Services was called to the Callahan home and the child was released into family members’ custody.
 Dolly Callahan was arrested on multiple preliminary charges of child neglect and could face up to a maximum of 114 years in jail if convicted.

", Death row inmate demands to be served a live cat as his last meal," 47-year Jason Dunlop was executed last night at the Colorado State Penitentiary for killing and eating a couple of hitchhikers in the city of Greeley in 2007.
 According to the penitentiary tradition respected by most American states, he was offered a last meal of his choice.
 Correctional officer Ramon Sanchez says he was totally shocked when he collected the paper on which Mr. Dunlop had written his request.
 Officer Sanchez explained to the inmate that there are rules concerning last meals and that those rules prohibit tobacco and alcohol.
 He also explained that the food must be purchased locally for a cost of less than $40 and that any unorthodox or unavailable requests would be replaced with substitutes.
 Unsurprisingly, Mr. Dunlop’s request was declined and he was served two slices of a cheese pizza, a chocolate bar and a cup of black coffee from the prison’s canteen.
 Correctional officer Ramon Sanchez says he was totally shocked when he discussed with Mr. Dunlop about his last meal request.
 The ritual associated with the prisoners’ last meals is usually respected in most American states where the death penalty is practiced, except in Texas where an unusual case lead to it being abolished.
 In September 2011,  Lawrence Russell Brewer requested a huge last meal including a plate of two chicken-fried steaks with gravy and sliced onions, a triple-patty bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños, a bowl of fried okra with ketchup, a pound of barbecued meat with half of a loaf of white bread, a portion of three fajitas, a meat lover’s pizza, a pint of Blue Bell ice cream, a slab of peanut-butter fudge with crushed peanuts, and a serving equivalent to three root beers.
 Mr. Brewer did not eat any of it, saying he was not hungry, a provocation which led the state of Texas to abolish all special last meal requests.

", Babysitter transported to hospital after inserting a baby in her vagina," Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night, reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina.
 The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site.
 The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening.
 One of the paramedics, Brian Whitmore, related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV.
 The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out.
 Ms. Brown and the child were finally transported to the hospital, where doctors were able to separate them after a delicate operation.
 The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip, but doctors don’t think he will suffer any sequelae from the incident.
 The paramedic, Ryan Whitmore, says he was shocked when he arrived on the scene and saw the fully dressed toddler caught in the woman’s vagina.
 The babysitter was interrogated by police and confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity.
 She explained that she was feeling depressed after her doctor told her she could never have children and wanted to know how it felt to give birth.
 Ms. Brown now faces a total of 11 criminal charges, including aggravated child neglect causing bodily harm, and could spend up to 65 years in prison.
 Her lawyer has asked for a psychiatric evaluation, claiming that she isn’t fit to stand trial.
 Depending on the results of the evaluation, her trial could begin in June.
 wtf this woman needs help
 She sounds like she needs to be in a mental institution not a prison. Hell too many courts just toss people who need mental help in a prison where they go from needing to help to fully criminally insane ad then after they serve their time they get released and at that point they become seriously dangerous. In a mental facility they get treatment and only get out if they are better.
 My suggestion would be tie her under a bus on a very busy street on very rainy weather until she sobers up then tie her to the blades of a helicopter for about a week so she can experience going around in circles for a while then give her to the mother to do as she pleases with her for 2 days with no cameras and nobody to stop her then give her life in prison so that she could think about what she did to that poor child

", Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap," According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.
 While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.
 Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated.
 Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.
 Jenna Davis says she heard the victim scream in agony as the crematory was reducing him to ashes.
 The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death.
 Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death.
 The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death.
 That will teach him to not sleep on the job, well maybe not him do much, as others.
 if only the employee was a necrophiliac, may still be alive.,

", Elderly woman accused of training her 65 cats to steal from neighbors," The Columbus Police Department opened an investigation on Ruth Gregson and her 65 cats in October after several neighbors reported small objects being stolen from their homes.
 Several victims reported being visited by Ms. Gregson’s cats before noticing the disappearance of several shiny objects, like valuable cutlery and pieces of jewelry.
 Despite their skepticism, investigators began a surveillance operation and were amazed by what they discovered.
 According to Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs,  dozens of cats were constantly coming and going, bringing home “anything that shined”.
 Upon searching Ms. Gregson’s house, investigators found $650,000 worth of jewelry and precious metal among piles of worthless shiny baubles.
 A total of 65 adult cats and 17 kittens were found on the site and entrusted to the Columbus Humane Society.
 Chief Jacobs says the elderly woman confessed to training her cats to steal, saying the felines had to “earn their meals”.
 According to the Columbus Police, Ms. Gregson’s animals could have stolen from more than 5,000 houses and apartment in the area, and investigators invite possible victims to contact them.
 Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs told reporters that the number of charges filed against Ms. Gregson could reach over five thousand.
 While Ms. Gregson is the first person in American history to be accused of training cats to steal, this isn’t the first time that animals are trained to commit crimes.
 In 2009, a surveillance that caught a monkey stealing hundreds of dollars worth of plants from a Texas nursery.
 At the time, the police and store owners had hypothesized that the monkey had been trained to take the plants and hand them over a fence to a waiting human accomplice.
 In 2013, a Chicago court sentenced a man to five years in prison for training ferrets to steal cell phones from people on the street and on public buses.
 As long as no cats were hurt, this was epic!

  “She would only feed the animals if they brought home valuables, so the animals had to steal every day in order to survive. Most were voluntarily malnurished so they would easily gain the neighbors’ pity and be allowed inside their houses.”

"," FBI seizes over 3,000 penises during raid at morgue employee’s home"," The Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected 54-year old Dave Murray, an employee of the Harris County Morgue, of being implicated in an organ trafficking network.
 Investigating several reports of missing organs and body parts, dozens of agents raided his residence this morning, hoping to find evidence of his involvement in the crimes.
 What they found on the site was a lot more disturbing than what they expected, as the FBI spokesman Andy Ramirez described the scene in an interview with WNTV-4.
 According to Agent Ramirez, the accused rapidly confessed everything as soon as he was arrested.
 It took the FBI more than seven hours to gather all the organs and other pieces of evidence that were found on the site.
 A dozen federal agents of the FBI’s Evidence Response Team were still identifying, collecting, and packing jars more than six hours after their arrival on the site.
 A total of 53 criminal charges have already been filed against Mr. Murray and hundreds more could be filed over the next few days.
 An anonymous FBI source told WNTV-4 that the number of charges could reach over 3,000.
 Dave Murray will remain in custody for the moment as a psychiatric evaluation has been ordered to determine if he’s fit to stand trial.
 If he is considered fit, he should appear in court in October for the beginning of the procedures.

 Samantha Irving, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation.
 Despite Ms. Irving’s doubts, she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious.
 Bill Austin, one of the paramedics who transported the couple, claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood.
 The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital, where doctors were able to separate the couple.
 Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable, while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises.
 According to doctors, both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome.
 Dr. Frank Olson, who treated the couple upon their arrival at the hospital, says that such extreme sexual practices are extremely dangerous and recommends to completely avoid them.
 Incidents like this one are, indeed, quite unusual, but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse.
 According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 3,213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3,789 in 2016.
 According to the same data, the Morrisons are the first couple to be hospitalized for a head stuck inside a vaginal cavity since October 2007.

 All of a sudden, a large “gorilla-like” creature dropped from a tree in front of him and punched him in the face.
 While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls.
 Mr. Whitaker immediately reported the attack to both the Glenwood Springs Police Department (GSPD) and the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency and a joint investigation has been launched.
 Investigators found some extremely large footprints on the site, which they believe are those of the aggressor.
 Darrel Whitaker is convinced that the creature who attacked him was a sasquatch, but the GSPD investigators say it’s more probable that the attacker is simply a particularly large and hairy man.
 They are currently interrogating nearby residents to see if anyone noticed an individual corresponding to the description of the suspect.
 If you possess any information concerning the suspect, please contact the Glenwood Springs Police Department or the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-worker-arrested-after-giving-birth-to-a-dead-mans-baby/
", Morgue worker arrested after giving birth to a dead man’s baby," Jennifer Burrows, an assistant pathologist with the Jackson County medical examiner services, is accused of having sex with dozens of corpses over the course of the last two years, a behavior which led the birth of a baby boy on January 7.
 According to the Kansas City Missouri Police Department, her baby is the son of a man who died in a car accident in March 2017, and whose body she was supposed to autopsy. They allege that Ms. Burrows sexually abused more than 60 other dead bodies, belonging to males aged from 17 to 71 years of age.
  “We opened an investigation into this case in October after we were informed that the suspect may have been sexually abusing corpses,”
 Police Chief Forté told reporters.
  “We accumulated enough evidence over the last few months to obtain a warrant for a paternity test on her newborn son. It confirmed our suspicions, that the father of her child was, indeed, a 57-year old veterinarian from Texas who was driving through the county when he had a fatal car accident. All the evidence that we have gathered suggests that he had never met Ms. Burrows before his demise and that he was already dead when the baby was conceived.”
 The KCMO Police Chief, Darryl Forté, briefly commented Ms. Burrows’ arrest this morning during a press conference, calling it “one of the most sordid cases he has seen in his career”.
 There are currently no laws (state or federal) governing or explicitly outlawing the practice of necrophilia since the corpse is considered human remains and no longer living. Therefore, it is technically legal in the state of Missouri, and Ms. Burrows’ actions are judged as an indecent treatment of a corpse.
 She is facing a total of 158 charges, including indecent treatment of a corpse, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs.
 The psychologists and experts that we interviewed were divided in their interpretation of Ms. Burrows’ case.
 Some, like Professor Isabella Ramirez of the University of Missouri, believe that the young woman was suffering from a psychosis and had, at least partially, lost any notion of reality.
 Others, like Dr. Gerald Porter, a well-known psychologist and expert in sexual disorders associated with the Institute of Psychological Sciences, believe that the accused is clearly a compulsive necrophiliac and that her choice of profession was inspired by her sexual deviation in the first place.
 All seem to agree, however, that the 26-year-old woman was suffering from mental problems and that she will probably register a plea of insanity.
 So a dead man can get an erection and ejaculate after death or did she just harvest semen and inseminate herself ? She can do me when I am dead no problem.
 She probably figured she’d just stop for a cold one before she went home.
 Can someone please explain to me how she got pregnant by a dead guy? Am I missing something?

", Yoga teacher hospitalized after performing blowjob on himself," Marvin Lewinski, 39, who was practicing a Tibetan form of Tantric yoga at the time of the incident, managed to contact 9-1-1 before eventually losing consciousness moments later.
 Lewinski, a Malibu yoga instructor who specializes in teaching Karmamudrā, a Vajrayana Buddhist technique of sexual practice with a physical or visualized consort, said he should have been more prudent in his practice.
 Dr. Peter Irving at the Malibu Urgent Care Center said that his patient would have suffered brain damage or organ failure if the procedure hadn’t been carried out in time.
  Lewinski
   admits that even though he has 12 years of experience as a teacher of Karmamudrā techniques, he should have never attempted the risky maneuvers by himself.
 Although Tantric sex is usually practiced with a partner, Lewinski claims his superior techniques involve “highly evolved spiritual beings” with whom “sex becomes an expression of divine union” and a “conduit for consciousness.”
 Marvin Lewinski, who currently has no medical insurance, is set to launch a GoFundMe campaign this week where he will offer free online yoga classes to help him reimburse his medical fees that amount up to $236,000.
 I knew a Chinese guy who did himself. lol
 How did he call 911 with his dick in his mouth?
 Probably why he started yoga in the first place…. ya know ….
 Does he have somenthing in common with Monika Levinsky? ;]
 Please note that this has nothing to do with Buddhism and appreciate if you change the wordings as I feel this is an insult for Buddhists and Buddhism.

", Teacher on crystal meth strips naked in class and bites 2 students," According to the Olympia police department, 37-year old Laura James was “visibly intoxicated and behaving erratically” when she showed up for work this morning.
 Due to a lack of replacement teachers, she was still allowed to teach her class but rapidly went out of control.
 Olympia police spokesman, Lieutenant Robert Emery described the incident during a press conference held a few hours later.
 The students became agitated and scared by their teacher’s erratic behavior and some of them tried to leave the classroom.
 The naked teacher then turned very aggressive and started grasping and biting students while howling and growling loudly.
 Lt. Emery says the children were only saved by the rapid intervention of another teacher who intervened and was able to subdue Ms. James.
 Olympia police spokesman, Lieutenant Robert Emery, saluted the courage of the teacher who subdued the intoxicated woman and described him as a true hero.
 Laura James now faces a total of 23 criminal charges, including aggravated assault, child endangerment, criminal neglect, and indecent exposure.
 If found guilty on all charges, she faces a maximum of 65 years in prison and a fine of $85,000.
 Her lawyers have already announced her intention to plead “not guilty”, claiming that Ms. James has mental problems and cannot be considered responsible for her actions.
 She is expected to appear in court in January for the beginning of her trial.
 Ridiculous, No excuse… Lack of replacement teachers… What are they going to do now. Administration is at fault for the events taking place after allowing her to be alone with children in her state. That’s as bad as a bus driver showing up drunk, but since they don’t have a sub driver letting them drive anyway….. Or maybe that has happened! This school needs to be investigated as well.
 Sounds like a psychotic episode. She needs mental health care.
 I thoughtthey did deep backround checks, I guess not.
 One between her eyes. Two in her heart. Problem solved.

", Canada: Hells Angels sue government for $2 billion revenue loss over legalization of marijuana," The illegal production and consumption of non-medical cannabis was worth about $400 million last year in the province of Quebec alone, according to a Statistics Canada analysis of the underground economy.
 “We estimate that Prime minister Justin Trudeau’s radical action of legalizing marijuana could cost my client’s organization a potential loss of $2 billion dollars in the next decade,” acknowledged Hells Angels’ lawyer, Brandon Tuggs.
 Prime minister Justin Trudeau’s nationwide legalization of marijuana on October 17 has enraged members of the Quebec chapter of the Hells Angels who believe legalization could destroy “hundreds of thousands of Canadian jobs”
 “I’ve been selling weed since I’m 12 years old” admits Gino Ouellet, 56, a Hells Angels member for the past 36 years.
 “Do you think I’m going to want to go work at Walmart or McDonald’s at minimal wage? I don’t think so” he told reporters.
 “It’s not the job of the federal government to regulate illegal drugs, they should take care of their own business and leave that to us” he argues.
 Canada is the first country among developed nations to legalize marijuana.
 In the United States, a number of states have currently legalized or decriminalized marijuana, but it is still illegal at the federal level.
 Anon.. You lack common sense.. Glad you went anon… A good drug dealer never laces their stuff with anything that could kill a customer…same as tim hortons isnt going to poison coffee… That and bad mouthing guys like that or pointing fingers gets people hurt
 These guys push out terrible drugs with dangerous cutting agents. Shake n bake speed pills, bad sheet acid that is impure lsd or RC’s such as nbomes. Selling random piperidines and other RC’s as “molly”. Ethylone as example. These are definetly not the people I want growing my marijuana. Iwouldn’t be shocked if they were the ones behind the glass shard cut weed that was around for a while, but I don’t know if they were, probably some of them have good intentions but honnestly fuck them give people who arent murderes a job.

 “From growing operations to trimming, packaging, transportation, and selling, this new legislation will threaten the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Canadian workers” he warns.

 “Many members of our organization fear they will lose their way of life if legalization is sustained,” said Quebec Hells Angels’ spokesman, Jean-Roch Fournier.

", Canadians face major donut shortage after first day of cannabis legalization," 17 Tim Horton’s in seven different provinces were forced to close earlier than usual for lack of staff and the shortage of donuts and pastries has reported one spokesman for the company.
 Tim Horton spokesman James Dyke said that he had no explanation for the unexpected hike in demand for goods offered by the popular coffee shop franchise but that some had suggested it could be linked to the recent legalization of cannabis.
 Several donut and pastry displays were emptied in a matter of minutes one Tim Horton employee reported.
 Tim Horton’s head office in Oakville has also sent emails to its franchisees warning them of possible flour shortages in the upcoming weeks due to the unexpected hike in demand.
 The head office also suggested hiring more staff at certain high traffic locations and even suggested posting security guards at highly crowded intersections in areas such as Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.
 On Wednesday, Canada became the first G7 nation and second country in the entire world after Uruguay to legalize the recreational use of cannabis.

"," Janitor who worked at sperm bank suspected of fathering 20,000 children over 20 year period"," Robert Casgrain, 58, who has worked as a janitor at the Toronto-based fertility clinic since 1996, is suspected by administrators of switching hundreds of semen specimens with his own sperm over a 20 year period.
 Administrators claim in the official police report that they estimate Casgrain could potentially be the father to over 22,000 children over a period stretching two decades.
 Although Robert Casgrain’s motives for replacing the sperm donors’ samples with his own are not clear at the moment, legal experts believe these revelations could unleash a potential class-action lawsuit against the former janitor.
 Detective Sergeant Rod Patterson of the Toronto Police Service warned that “even though the precise numbers are not known”, Robert Casgrain’s sperm “may have given birth to thousands of children over a 20 year period” he said during a press conference.
 Administrators at the fertility clinic were warned by employees of Casgrain’s erratic behavior and installed hidden cameras in the embryology laboratory last month before eventually contacting the police.
 According to one employee who witnessed the surveillance footage, Casgrain is seen emptying the vials of semen into a sink and filling one up with his own sperm while masturbating to pornographic material.
 Although it is impossible at the moment to know how many births resulted of Robert Casgrain’s manipulations at the embryology laboratory, DNA tests performed on clinical samples over the next year should authenticate which specimens are from Casgrain.
 Legal experts believe Casgrain could face a sentence as low as 18 months and up to three to five years in prison according to current Canadian laws.

 No point in him worrying about the prison sentence, its the child support he should be worried about.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/monsanto-ceo-gets-well-deserved-600-million-bonus-for-last-year/
", Monsanto CEO gets well-deserved $600 million bonus for last year," After being questioned on the subject by investors on Wednesday during Monsanto Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, the company Board of directors released the information this morning, announcing that it had granted Mr. Grant $603.45 million in an annual bonus, including $574 million in restricted stock units.
 Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Pierre Courduroux, justified the bonus by saying that despite the fact that the year was a bit disappointing in terms of sales and profits, the company had built some “very solid and concrete bases” for many future projects.
 According to Mr. Courduroux, the false accusations made by some South American doctors, which had linked one of their products with the numerous cases of birth defects, are largely responsible for the fall in the company’s profits.
 Monsanto announced on Wednesday, that its profit had fallen by 25% in the second quarter compared to the same period a year ago.
 According to most experts, the company has suffered as farmers cut back on spending, squeezed by plummeting commodity prices. Its bottom line has also been pressured by the strong dollar and price cuts on products, spurred by competitors.
 Despite these setbacks, the leaderboard of the corporation, which has a long history of working with agricultural producers to boost yields and come up with valuable innovations, seems confident to be able to bounce back over the next few months.
 He should not be given a penny with a salary of $19.5 M but it’s how the globalist reward their peons for committing murder around the globe.

  “Some of you might be alarmed by the plummeting profits, but we are extremely optimistic for the future,” Mr. Courduroux told reporters. “In the last year, we were victims of ridiculous accusations concerning the Zika virus, but we expect some record profits over the next few years. We’ve made a lot of investments which should start paying up soon, and we’ve decided to reward Mr. Grant for the important role that he played in generating these future profits. This guy is a genius, and $600 million is a very small price to pay for such a brilliant mind!”

 Caught in full action during the night of the birthday bash, the FBI raid engaged more than 16 agents in what local officials believe to be the biggest crackdown on an animal brothel in American history.
 Hundreds of piglets were forced into sexual acts with clients of the pig brothel
 Local authorities fear a recrudescence in sexually deviant behavior with animals in the region since this is the third animal brothel to be closed down in recent months in the area.
 – Dane Banff, psychologist
 “That human beings are allowed to unleash their wildest fantasies in such a context, even though illegal, might prevent such abuses as rape from being committed” she admits.
 “But at the same time, having sexual relations with pigs and other animals is not considered to be a healthy behavior and should not be encouraged” she acknowledges.
 The farmer and his sons could spend up to five years in prison expect legal experts.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/malaysia-airline-flight-forced-into-emergency-landing-after-flying-over-icelandic-volcano/
", Malaysia Airline Flight Forced Into Emergency Landing After Flying Over Icelandic Volcano," The company’s flight MH131 going from Paris to New York reportedly went through a zone of “heavy turbulence” with “very low visibility” for a few minutes, before many of the navigation equipment simply stopped working, forcing the pilots to land the plane manually.
 The pilots were directed to fly the Boeing 777 almost directly over the active Bardarbunga volcano, despite many warnings from the International Civil Aviation Organization.
 The extreme heat and a large number of sediments projected in the sky by the volcanic eruption have made the flight path extremely dangerous, as the damage to the plane shows.
 Trying desperately to cut its prices to bring back lost customers, the Malaysian company has decided to ignore all warnings and fly over the active volcano.
 The company’s regional senior vice president PK Lee, explained that the company had “thoroughly evaluated the risks” before choosing that flight path and that the passengers’ lives were “never really at risk”.
 The Boeing 777-200ER airplane was carrying 171 passengers and 11 crew members when it was forced to proceed to an emergency landing.
 Malaysia Airlines has been implicated in a series of incidents recently that have led many travelers away from the company. Flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing completely vanished on 8 March 2014.
 There has been no confirmation of any flight debris, and no crash site has been found. Flight MH17 crashed on 17 July 2014, presumably shot down over eastern Ukraine by a surface-to-air missile thought to have been fired by pro-Russian rebels, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board.
 Combined with an already poor financial situation, some aviation and economic experts believed these tragic events could spell the end for Malaysia Airlines.
 An ill-conceived promotional campaign asking passengers to nominate what they wanted to do before they died, did not help, following a series of people posting pictures of near empty planes on social media.
 But the airline is fighting back, promising “best value airfares for the UK and European dream holidays”, a policy that had brought a few passengers back. This new incident could, however, destroy much of their efforts.
 Bring back Idrs Jala please.He knows what he is doing.
 MAS almost hit another plane a month or so on the runway in Australia when taking off.Oh dear, and now this? What retribution is this? I wish MAS well.
 I used to fly with Malaysia Airways. The first accident or not I accepted. But then a flight over a region where already three air crafts shot down in one week, all the other airlines didn’t flight over this region… And then again and again, I hope that the people who are leading this company will get punished and so go into the Jail. Never fly with Malaysia airways should be a flyer in every airport.

 “There was lots of smoke and flying embers, it looked like hell!” says Mohamed Teuku, one of the survivors. “The plane was shaking and trembling, I thought it was going fall apart! I thought the company had learned their lesson and that they would stop putting people’s life in danger, but it looks like I was wrong… That’s it, I’m never flying with them again!”

"," Japanese Whaling Crew Eaten Alive By Killer Whales, 16 dead"," The crew of the
   MV Nisshin Maru
 (日新丸), Japan’s primary whaling vessel and the world’s only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ship’s processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil.
 The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea.  The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. “It was horrific” claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome  scene. “The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere” he recalls in tears.
 The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic. The East Asian nation halted its annual Antarctic whaling mission after the U.N.’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last march the hunt violated an international moratorium on commercial whaling.
 “It seems Japan just doesn’t give a damn about international law” explains environmental activist and spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, James Ben Shahali, based in Vancouver. “The waste of life is always a shame, but the whales are not to blame here, they were only doing what they are born to do: kill for food” he adds.
 Some Greenpeace supporters have even celebrated the incident as a victory for the fight against whale hunting worldwide
 Japan has slaughtered over 6,000 whales since commercial whaling was made illegal by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium passed in 1986.
 Bloody good job let’s hope the whales continue to fight back!

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/german-scientists-prove-there-is-life-after-death/
", German Scientists Prove There is Life After Death," This astonishing announcement is based on the conclusions of a study using a new type of medically supervised near-death experiences, that allow patients to be clinically dead for almost 20 minutes before being brought back to life.
 This controversial process that was repeated on 944 volunteers over that last four years, necessitates a complex mixture of drugs including epinephrine and dimethyltryptamine, destined to allow the body to survive the state of clinical death and the reanimation process without damage.
 The extremely long duration of the experience was only recently made possible by the development of a new cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) machine called the AutoPulse.
 This type of equipment has already been used over the last few years to reanimate people who had been dead for somewhere between 40 minutes to an hour.
 Near-death experiences have been hypothesized in various medical journals in the past, as having the characteristics of hallucinations, but Dr Ackermann and his team, on the contrary, consider them as evidence for the existence of the afterlife and of a form of dualism between mind and body.
 The team of scientists led by Dr. Berthold Ackermann has monitored the operations and have compiled the testimonies of the subjects.
 Although there are some slight variations from one individual to another, all of the subjects have some memories of their period of clinical death. and a vast majority of them described some very similar sensations.
 The scientists say that they are well aware the many of their conclusions could shock a lot of people, like the fact that the religious beliefs of the various subjects seem to have held no incidence at all, on the sensations and experiences that they described at the end of the experiment.
 “I know our results could disturb the beliefs of many people,” says Mr Ackermann.
 “But in a way, we have just answered one of the greatest questions in the history of mankind, so I hope these people will be able to forgive us. Yes, there is life after death and it looks like this applies to everyone.”
 We each have an electronic signature as does everything else. It is
 not unique at all.
 I need more proof than that my father just passed 3 months ago and I need to know if he is here or just dead.

 The body of the subject was then put into a temporary comatic state induced by a mixture of other drugs which had to be filtered by ozone from his blood during the reanimation process 18 minutes later.

 Most common memories include a feeling of detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of an overwhelming light.

 Indeed, the volunteers counted in their ranks some members of a variety of religions, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and atheists.

"," Man kicked out of all-you-can-eat buffet after eating more than 50 lbs of food, sues for $2-million"," According to witnesses, the 51-year-old man who lives on welfare was expelled from the restaurant after he then spent more than 7 hours on-site, ingesting a quantity of food which has been estimated between 50 and 70 pounds.
 Despite the fact that the restaurant advertised the buffet as “all-you-can-eat”, the manager of the establishment seems to have lost patience at some point, telling him that his meal would be free but asking him to leave.
 The manager’s intervention angered Mr. Fleming, and a brief altercation took place before he was finally pushed out of the restaurant.
 He immediately called the police and filed a complaint against the restaurant, and he intends to make the people responsible for his mistreatment, pay for their actions.
 “It’s a serious injustice, and I am deeply insulted!” Mr. Flemmings told reporters.
 Mr. Flemming says the employee of the Golden Corral did not use any insulting language, but he claims that the disgust that was visible on their faces has left him with some deep emotional wounds.
 The direction of the restaurant chain quickly issued a press release announcing that the decision to expel Mr. Flemmings was a regrettable personal initiative from an overzealous franchise manager.
 They also said that some financial indemnities had been offered to compensate the damage suffered by the victim, but had been refused.
 Mr. Flemmings confirmed that he had been offered a significant amount of money by the company, but he is convinced that he can get more if he goes to court.
 The primary hearing, in this case, should take place on March 7, at the Springfield District Court.

 “I am amazed how things are going well for her and wish her the best,” she said during the press conference.
 Some conservative experts believe the statement could affect the presidential candidate’s bid for the 2020 presidency but previous allegations of Hillary Clinton’s lesbian past, which have resurfaced a number of times in the past two decades, have not seemed to have had a major impact in Hillary’s political career to date, admit others.

", Supreme Court grants black man “40 acres of land and a mule”," The 61-year old man filed a lawsuit against the federal government in 2011, accusing the United States of violating their obligations to his ancestor, who died in 1891.
 His great-grandfather, Elijah Brown, along with 18,000 other freed slaves who had fought for the Union in the American Civil War, had been promised “40 acres of land and a mule” by the U.S. army in 1865, but never received anything.
 By a narrow 5-4 vote, the Supreme court ruled that the U.S. government had to hold the promises made to these 18,000 freed slaves, by granting the promised acreage and animals to their descendants.
 Mr. Brown and his supporters were visibly happy when the court announced the verdict, applauding and cheering loudly as the court announced its decision.
 The Supreme court decision is based on military orders issued during the American Civil War.
 The orders dealing specifically with the freed slaves are called
  Special Field Orders, No. 15,
 and were issued by General William Tecumseh Sherman, commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi of the United States Army, on January 16, 1865.
 They provided for the confiscation of 400,000 acres (1,600 km
   2
 ) of land along the Atlantic coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida and the dividing of it into parcels of not more than 40 acres (0.16 km
   2
 ), on which were to be settled approximately 18,000 freed slave families and other Blacks then living in the area.
 For the duration of the civil war, military officers had both special executive and legislative powers, and therefore, the Supreme Court judged that  General Sherman’s field orders have the same legal status as laws issued by the Congress, and have to be respected by the American government.
 NAACP national field director, Rev. Charles White, called the ruling a “historic step towards justice”.
 The decision of the Supreme court could have some major consequences, as it implies that the descendants of the 18,000 other free slave families covered by the 1865 field order.
 The NAACP, who supported M. Brown throughout all the court procedures, saluted the decision of the Supreme Court.
 The NAACP leader also called for a class action lawsuit, noting that more than 120,000 Americans are direct descendants of these slaves.

", Cousins arrested after refusing to stop having sex during funeral ceremony," Tiffany Bates, 31, and Clifton Bridges, 19, who are in fact close relatives, were apprehended by Talladega County Police after employees of the Talladega Funeral Home complained that the couple was having “loud sex,” “perturbing funeral services” as well as “scaring the guests.”
 Tiffany Bates and Clifton Bridges, who were both attending the funeral ceremony of their grandmother with other family members, decided to skip away from the funeral ceremony and indulge in sexual activities only meters away.
 “We alerted Talladega police after several unsuccessful attempts to stop them from having sex on the property of the funeral home” explained Talladega Funeral Home employee, Jane Andrews.
 Both suspects admitted being under the influence of amphetamines, GHB, and crystal meth when apprehended according to Talladega County Police Officer, Samuel Johnson.
 Apparently, Tiffany Bridges and Clifton Bridges are first cousins and had been living together as a couple for the past 6 months according to family members.
 The couple faces 26 charges for lewd and lascivious behavior, disturbing the peace, obscenity in a public place and drug possession.

", Terrorist who hid grenades in anus dies of internal bleeding at Iraqi airport," The terrorist warned airport authorities himself claiming he was in agonizing pain after he had hidden two grenades in his rectum and had planned to blow up a plane.
 An Iraqi bomb squad rapidly evacuated the man in the back of a pickup truck and brought him 2 km outside of the airport, in the middle of the desert, and out of “harm’s way” declared officials.
 – Massoud Chalabi, Bomb squad supervisor
 Two shuttlecock grenades were later retrieved in the dead man’s body. Shuttlecock grenades are heavily used by ISIS forces but it’s the first time someone tries to smuggle them inside their body, admit officials.
 Iraqi authorities proceeded to the man’s evacuation in a matter of minutes and are satisfied no civilian was harmed during the arrest.
 “The man had not been in the airport for two minutes that he was already crying and asking God for help so that he would not let him die this way,” explains chief of Baghdad International Airport security, Karim Hassan.
 “He kept crying and saying he wished he had kept his day job as a janitor instead,” he recalled.
 The Iraqi bomb squad nearly took eighteen hours to retrieve the explosives from the dead man’s corpse after the man had bled to his death after several hours in agonizing pain.
 “At first, my men asked if we could just blow him up, but Headquarters asked us to retrieve the explosives for analysis. It is important to understand what kind of weaponry the enemy is using” explained bomb squad supervisor, Massoud Chalabi.
 The bomb squad proceeded to cut the man’s body in half before retrieving the bomb, an 18-hour process which left the body unrecognizable.
 Suicide bombers are usually considered by Islam as martyrs in the context where infidels are killed but in this case, since the only life taken was his own, he would theoretically not be allowed into heaven, admit experts.
 No terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for the failed terrorist attack at the moment but authorities suspect he possibly has ties to ISIS.

"," Stuck 71 hours in an elevator, man kills and eats his wife to survive"," According to the Philadelphia Police Department, the partially devoured corpse of his wife was lying next to him when he was rescued after being stuck for three days in an elevator.
 Mr Franklin immediately confessed that he had reluctantly killed her and eaten almost 12 lbs of her flesh, saying it was necessary to his own survival.
 Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross, says the accused clearly felt guilty about his crime
 Commissioner Ross says the accused started crying as soon as he was freed from the elevator and kept repeating “Why did I do it?”
 Mr Franklin and his wife, Janet Willis, were coming back from the restaurant when they took an express elevator to reach their apartment on the 42nd floor.
 On their way up, the elevator unexpectedly stopped, and the couple was stranded.
 Mr Franklin says he hit the alarm and waited, but nothing happened. He investigated his surroundings, but there was no warning text and no elevator emergency phone in the 6-by-6 box.
 Since they didn’t have their cell phones with them, the couple had no way of reaching the outside world.
 Hours went by and no one came. Starting to get desperate, the 300-lb man tried to pry the door open, planning to climb down the elevator shaft like Bruce Willis in
  Die Hard
 . Instead, he was met with a solid concrete wall with the number 13 stenciled on it.
 Being in an express elevator, there was no opening for the floors that weren’t served, and Mr. Franklin found himself facing 34 floors of solid concrete shaft.
 The couple were stuck in an express elevator, and the shaft had no access to the lower floors.
 The couple could do nothing but stand there for the rest of the afternoon. And into the night. And then overnight. Then all day the next day.
 After about 48 hours, Mr Franklin says he was suffering from severe dehydration and began fearing for his life.
 According to his lawyer, Darrel Hunter, Bruce Franklin had no other choice than to kill his wife and ingest her flesh and blood if he wanted to survive.
 Mr Hunter says his client is in fact a victim and that Ms Willis’ death was caused by the negligence of the residential building’s security staff.
 Despite his lawyer’s claims, Mr Franklin now faces a total of 14 charges, including second degree murder and cannibalism. He could face up to 75 years in prison.
 And yet some say the donner party were legends and heroes. Js

", Nepal: Climber survives brutal sexual assault by Yeti-like creature," Jason Barclay, 28, was on a solo adventure across the Himalayas with his two local sherpas when he was attacked during the night by what he believed was a bear.
 The creature lashed through his tent and started to shove the half-asleep man around, who managed to stay still despite his fear.
 Barclay finally realized the creature was, in fact, not a bear when he came into direct eye contact with the beast.
 The creature then attempted some form of sexual interaction with him, involving humping and loud moaning, recalled the victim.
 Pushpa Deuba, one of the two sherpas accompanying Barclay, lies in critical condition after he came to Barclay’s rescue by making loud noises with some pans and was briefly attacked by the creature.
 Although it was dark and the attack occurred at night, both sherpas believe it was a yeti and not a bear, as bears do not climb at those altitudes they explained to the Kathmandu Herald.
 Jason Barclay has also kept some specimen of the semen for scientific analysis but says no serious research group has shown any interest at the moment.
 Although yeti is believed to be a legendary creature of the Himalayan regions, hundreds of encounters are nonetheless reported to local authorities by mountain climbers each year.

", Thailand: Tourist wearing fake shark fin harpooned 9 times by villagers," 27-year old David Smith and two of his friends were enjoying the first day of a two-week vacation in Thailand and had decided to spend some time at the beach.
 Around 10:00 AM, Mr. Smith moved a few hundred meters away from his friends in order to put on a fake shark fin and pull a prank on them.
 He started swimming towards the beach with only the fin emerging from the water, provoking an instant reaction from the local fishermen.
 More than a dozen fishing boats filled with men armed with harpoons encircled the young man only 20 meters away from his friends.
 They fired dozens of projectiles in his direction and speared him a total of nine times before they realized their mistake.
 According to Francis McKensie, one of the victim’s friends who witnessed the incident, the fishermen reacted extremely fast and “fired without thinking”.
 Mr. McKensie says his friend rapidly emerged from the water, screaming from pain, but he had already been hit by several harpoons.
 The fishermen finally understood that Mr. Smith wasn’t a shark and they rapidly carried him to the shore and called for help.
 The young man was transported to six hours he Pattaya International Hospital, where doctors finally able to stabilize him after six hours of intensive care.
 Thai national police chief Somyot Poompanmoung said he was “very happy” to hear that the victim had survived. He declared that the fishermen who injured the young American man acted to defend the swimmers and no charges will be filed against them.
 Fake shark fins have been popular items among pranksters for more than twenty years, and have caused several unfortunate incidents.
 In 2009, two women were severely injured in Australia after being trampled by a group of swimmers running away from a man with a fin.
 In 1996, a man was hit by 16 bullets and killed in Florida after approaching a private beach while wearing a fake shark fin.
 Despite numerous accidents and warnings from authorities, many thrill seekers continue to buy and wear these items to try and scare their friends and family.
 Sounds like he deserved it…
 Actually we should be condemning the killers who shoot before thinking.
 Firstly they didnt kill anyone. And even if they did, blame the prankster.

", Veterinarian accused of having sex with more than 300 dogs," According to the Trenton Police Department, an investigation was launched on Dr. James Thompson in January after several dog owners filed complaints about their dogs suffering from anal bleeding after visiting his clinic.
 During the investigation, the police convinced the owners of the West Trenton Animal Hospital where Dr. Thompson practiced to install several new security cameras around the building.
 The police and the owners were completely shocked when they saw the video footage a few weeks later.
 Over a period of two weeks, Dr. Thompson was filmed sexually aggressing 19 different dogs, mostly smaller breeds like miniature poodles, bichons, and chihuahuas.
 TPD spokesman Lt. Frank Simmons says the aggressions were rather violent and must have been traumatizing for the animals.
 According to Lt. Simmons, the veterinarian could have made a great number of victims.
 A total of 352 criminal charges have been filed against him, and the TPD says this number will probably double over the next few days.
 Trenton Police Chief, Captain Tommy Wright, says the investigation was far from complete but the investigators decided to arrest Dr. Thompson before he assaulted other animals. According to him, the number of victims could be over 5000.
 Dr. Thompson’s was released on bail a few hours after his arrest and immediately met reporters to claim his innocence.
 He says he’s never sexually abused any animal, and that all animals with whom he’s had sex consented to the intercourse.
 He is expected to appear in court in November for the beginning of his trial.

", Qatar: Man arrested for smuggling bacon in his anal cavity," 53-year old Abd al Rahman Shamoun was spotted by a specially trained police dog, looking for drugs or pork meat on passengers and in their luggage.
 He appeared visibly nervous and sweaty, so the customs took him in a separate office for a more thorough search and investigation.
 The search revealed 4 larges condoms hidden in his anal cavity, each containing more than 3 kilograms of bacon.
 In a press conference this morning, the Qatar Police Force presented the smuggled bacon and announced it had launched an investigation to determine if Mr. Shamoun was part of a larger bacon trafficking network.
 People ingesting or inserting illegal drugs, money, jewelry, or weapons in various cavities, is a rather common practice and airports around the world are used to dealing with such cases.
 This is the first time, however, that bacon is discovered during a cavity search.
 Due to Qatar’s strict laws regarding pork meat and other food that isn’t “permissible” or “allowed” in Islam, Mr. Shamoun faces some very serious criminal charges.
 Accused of “possession of controlled substances”, “trafficking controlled substances” and “illegal importation of controlled substances”, he could now face the death penalty, with a minimum of 50 lashes and 15 years in prison.

 From dawn to dusk, the 20,000 guests were treated to the worlds greatest DJs such as Tiesto, Armin Van Buren and David Guetta, the event being presented by no less than Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, personal friends of his father.
 As the party went on, the intensity seems to have caught on to the young birthday boy who took on to test his new gift: a Tiger Attack Helicopter given to him by his father.
 If at first the party went well, things started to change when the young heir took to try out his new Tiger Attack Helicopter
 The young billionaire told the helicopter pilot he wanted to shoot some elephants, a request the pilot claims he could not refuse, even though it required passing over the Somalian and Kenyan international border.
  «There is no way I was going to find elephants in Somalia and my orders were to escort him to wherever he wanted, so we went to Kenya,» he told local Somali reporters.
 That is when they took in the direction of the Boni National Reserve situated in the North Eastern Province of Kenya, only a few miles from the birthday party.
 20 elephants have been found slaughtered in the past 24 hours in Boni National reserve and more could be found, claim park officials
 Officials were told the young party goers do not remember how much elephants they killed. «They were pretty drunk but were very polite» remembers the pilot, visibly amused at the whole story. «I guess boys will be boys» he adds.
 The animal massacre has received international criticism from conservancy funds worldwide, the African elephant being on the WWF endangered species list.

 take him to that same jungle – set a post into the ground – strip him naked and tie him to the post – cover him with pigs blood, milk and honey – come back 1 week later.
 Hey how about you run around in the open field and I’ll hunt you down and shoot you like a wild animal and let the buzzers eat you.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/black-lives-matter-leader-exposed-as-white-man-using-tanning-injections/
", Black Lives Matter leader exposed as white man using tanning injections," The
  Kalamazoo Herald
 revealed yesterday that the director of BLM for the state of Michigan, known as Jamal Brown, was actually 53-year old Maurice Clark, a Caucasian former bank manager from Detroit.
 Mr. Clark apparently began using tan injections on himself in 2011, a few months after losing his job at the Bank of America.
 When interviewed by the newspaper, his former neighbors revealed that he began behaving strangely at the time and using stereotypical “gangsta rap” expressions.
 Mr. Clark moved to Kalamazoo in January 2012 and assumed the identity of Jamal Brown.
 In a matter of months, the dynamic and capable man was occupying important positions in various civil rights organizations across Michigan.
 In 2013, he was one of the founders of the Kalamazoo chapter of Black Lives Matter and has gained much influence within the organization since that time.
 BLM named Jamal Brown as general director for the state of Michigan in 2014 and he had played that role even since.
 Local leaders of the Kalamazoo BLM chapter reacted to Mr.Clark/Brown’s resignation, saying it was a “personal decision” and that the movement did not ask him to quit.
 The last few months had been quite hectic for the activist after some attacks on his legitimacy began to surface.
 In December 2016, a first wave of rumors concerning his origins began to circulate on the social media, leading some reporters to investigate.
 In April, the
  Kalamazoo Herald
 published a series of articles revealing the Jamal Brown was a fabricated identity and that he wasn’t who he pretended to be.
 Finally, yesterday morning, the same newspaper revealed that it had discovered Mr. Brown’s true identity, publishing fourteen pages of documents to confirm its claim.
 According to these documents, the activist used regular melatonin injections to keep his skin pigmentation dark and protect his fake identity.
 The BLM leader didn’t deny the allegations and published a short message on Facebook in which he asks for forgiveness and resigns from his position.
 Mr. Clark said he would not make any more comments on his resignation and has refused all demands for interviews.
 Despite the apparent identity fraud, a spokesperson of Black Lives Matter said the organization held no grudge against its former leader and announced that it would not file any accusations against him.
 Talk about cultural appropriation!

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/genetically-modified-ants-could-replace-honey-bees-claims-monsanto-expert/
"," Genetically Modified Ants Could Replace Honey Bees, Claims Monsanto Expert"," The $3 million dollar grant from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has led the team of researchers at Monsanto to develop alternative strategies to “survive” an eventual honey bee Colony collapse disorder (CCD), a
  phenomenon that has been increasing in the past decade and that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear, a situation that could “dramatically impact the world’s food supply”, admit experts.
 John Leere, head biochemist at Monsanto, believes a genetically modified ant could eventually replace bees, in case of a total collapse of the species
 The team of researchers has developed a genetically modified ant that could “possibly save the world’s food supply”.
  “Yet, we did not despair and eventually started testing on winged virgin queens and males of the ant species. Although ants usually lose their wings after the queen has been inseminated and starts to give birth to the new colony, genetic manipulation has produced a flying ant species that is strikingly similar to the common honey bee, and 50 times stronger to certain types of pesticides” he acknowledges, visibly enthused by the discovery.
  According to a recent Greenpeace study, seventy out of the top 100 human food crops, which supply about 90 percent of the world’s nutrition, are pollinated by bees. US National Agriculture Statistics show a honey bee decline from about 3.2 million hives in 1947 to 2.4 million hives in 2008, a 90% reduction.
 Why not just stop killing bees ?
 The bees are dying because of your God meddling and altering dna of everything. Stop GMO MESSING UP LIFE AS WE KNOW IT
 Why not work with nature instead of messing it up some more! More freaks of nature!and God knows what this pesticide resistant bug will do. Certainly not what they want it to do. Freak food is bad enough

 “Latest studies have found a link between neonicotinoid pesticides that are vastly used in GE corn crops. As GE farming has become an essential part of agriculture in today’s modern world, we had to develop ways to promote both the continuity of GE farming and the survival of the honey bees, a fascinating challenge” admits John Leere, head biochemist of the project.

 “Since GE farming and neonicotinoid pesticides are here to stay, we first tried to modify the bees as to increase their immune system to these insecticides, with little or no success” admits the specialist.

 “Through genetic manipulations, we could eventually create a hybrid species that would have both the common honey bee’s pollinating characteristics, as well as possess the pesticide immunization properties of certain ant species, a perfect match that would take thousands of years to develop on its own in nature,” he explains.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/court-orders-tiger-woods-to-take-137-paternity-tests/
", Court orders Tiger Woods to take 137 paternity tests," The court’s decision comes after request formulated by 121 women who claim to have been Wood’s mistresses and to have given birth to his children.
 Many of the women yelled and cried with joy when the judge announced his verdict, as some of them had been fighting for more than seven years to obtain this judgment.
 One of the women who claim to have had children with the golfer, Molly Sanders, was interviewed by WFNC-TV only minutes after the court announced its decision.
 The court has given Mr. Woods 30 days to undergo a DNA test or face imprisonment and severe fines.
 Tiger Woods’ lawyer confirmed that their client would comply with the court’s decision and take all necessary tests.
 Molly Sanders attended court with her 8-year old son Tommy and says she can’t wait for her boy to finally meet his father.
 Tiger Woods contributed to the popularity of golf in the 1990s and was the dominant force in golf in the 2000s.
 Woods first took leave from professional golf in December 2009 in order to focus on his personal life, after his many alleged extramarital indiscretions were revealed by several women, through many worldwide media sources, leading to his divorce from Elin Nordegren.
 Since then, he has been having difficulties on the courses while attracting a lot of attention for his personal problems.
 In the days and months following Woods’ admission of infidelity, several companies re-evaluated their relationships with him. Accenture, AT&amp;T, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods.
 Earlier this year, the golfer was also implicated in an incident involving drugs and alcohol.
 On May 29, 2017, Woods was arrested near Jupiter, Florida by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office at about 3:00 am EDT for driving under the influence of five different types of drugs.
 This new judgment against him will certainly add more pressure on Wood’s shoulders, which means his performances on the golf courses aren’t bound to improve very soon.
 All these hoes looking free $$$$.. How many of them cheated on their bfs and husbands.. I’ll wait..
 Why would that woman want her son to meet his dad – after all is Tiger Woods – man who fucks many!
 What an idiot!! Why would you be put having unprotected sex anyway.. They got you again. Leave them nasty women alone
 These hoes don’t know who their children are for. He was nasty to mess with them.

 Discussing the country’s relations with the new American administration, the prince claimed that he had already offered Ivanka Trump 100 camels when she visited the country with her father earlier this year and had decided to double his offer.
 Prince Mohammed bin Salman even added that he would like to have children with the First Daughter.
 The Saudi Prince praised President Trump for “raising such an admirable woman” and said he would be delighted to be linked to “such a grat man”.
 Prince Mohammed bin Salman claims he had already offered Ivanka Trump 100 camels to spend a night with her when he met her during her visit to Saudi Arabia in May.
 The prince’s comment caused a lot of reactions in the U.S. and around the world.
 Many people on social media criticized the prince for using terms usually used for animal breeding, while others described as “barbaric” the concept of offering camels in exchange for a woman.
 A few American feminist organizations like the International Women’s Democracy Center have called for a boycott of Saudi oil to denounce the country’s “misogyny” and “condescending attitude towards women around the world”.
 Neither Donald Trump nor his daughter have reacted to the offer.
 The low life rag head should have offered 200 million dollars after she and D are no longer married. 200 million tax free in advance might not be enough.
 I know how she feels. When I was on holiday in Cairo my husband was approached by an arab and offered 100 camels for me in the hotel we were staying in, that was 20 years ago so the price hasn’t gone up much.

", Rupaul claims Trump touched him inappropriately in the 1990s," In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul said that Mr. Trump “made a move” on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie
  To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar
 .
 The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time and says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman.
 Rupaul says he was dressed “very sexy” for the party and is convinced that Trump thought he was a woman.
 Rupaul says he found Donald Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity.
 Rupaul told the
  Hollywood Inquirer
 that Donald Trump moved on him during a party, grabbing his ass and genitals.
  “He just wanted to use me as an object,” he told Hollywood Inquirer. “I’ve never felt so dirty in my life! In a way, I was saved by the fact that I’m a man.”
 This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump.
 Many women have come forward over the last week to denounce the abusive groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years.
 The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumps’s alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered.
 All these allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by
  The Washington Post
 and
  NBC News
 .
 The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show “Access Hollywood.”
 The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation.
 He added: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”
 In Rupaul’s case, Trump seems to have been disappointed by what he discovered under the dress.
 Guess he grabbed him by the boy pussy.
 Grabbed him by the ???????
 Lol. Now its getting deep. Im gay af. But now the gays have joined the club of….”””oh he touched me in my dirty area””” lmfgao.

 The self-designated “greatest artist of all times” publicly solicited the help of Mark Zuckerberg, whom he asked for $1 billion to keep making art. He also said he would be willing to accept money from Google’s Larry Page or any other rich benefactor.
 No billionaire has answered his plea yet, but the Philadelphia Police has extended a helping hand and offered him a job as a police officer.

 The Saudi Defence Minister, Prince Mohamad Bin Salman, made a controversial offer yesterday, during a press conference, that could solve Kanye West’s money problems,
 The powerful prince, who has an estimated wealth of more than a billion dollars, offered to pay the rapper $10M to spend one night with his wife.
 Prince Mohamad Bin Salman says that he doesn’t care about Kanye West or his music, but that he would gladly pay for his wife.
 Neither Kanye West nor Kim Kardashian, have reacted to the offer yet, but it has already provoked violent reactions from various feminist organizations.
 In an interview with CBS, the spokeswoman for the Women’s Liberation Action Network, Jane Austin, called the offer “an insult to women across the world”, saying that it shows how women are still treated as objects in certain parts of the world.
 The National Organization for Women even called for a protest, which is to take place in front of the Saudi embassy in Washington, on Saturday.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/retired-cia-agent-confesses-on-deathbed-i-killed-marilyn-monroe/
", Retired CIA Agent Confesses on Deathbed: “I Killed Marilyn Monroe”," Mr. Hodges, who worked for the CIA for 41 years as an operative with top-level security clearances, claims he was often employed as a hitman by the organization, to assassinate individuals who could represent a threat to the security of the country.
 Trained as both a sniper and a martial arts expert, Mr. Hodges says he also has significant experience with more unconventional methods of inflicting harm upon others, like poisons and explosives.
 Mr. Hodges swears he remembers vividly, each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA.  He claims that all 37 of the murders he committed on the American soil, were ordered by his commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.
 The elderly man claims he committed his assassinations between August 1959 and March 1972, at a time when he says “
  the CIA had its own agenda
 “. He says he was part of an operative cell of five members which carried out political assassinations across the country. Most of their victims were political activists, journalists, and union leaders, but he also claims that he killed a few scientists and artists whose ideas represented a threat to the interests of the United States.
 Mr. Hodges says that Marilyn Monroe remains unique among his victims, as she is the only woman he ever assassinated. He claims he has no regrets, however, as he says that she had become a “
  threat to the security of the country
 ”  and had to be eliminated.
    “We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy, but also with Fidel Castro”
  claims M. Hodges.
    ” My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die, and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”
 Marilyn Monroe died between midnight and 1 AM, on August 5, 1962. Mr Hodges claims he entered her room while she was sleeping and injected her with a massive dose of chloral hydrate (a powerful sedative), mixed with Nembutal (a short-acting barbiturate), causing her death.
 The 78-year old man was placed under custody by the FBI, which is taking Mr. Hodges’ confession very seriously and has opened an investigation to verify his allegations. The investigation might be very complicated, however, as very few written files are available on such secret activities and most of the actors implicated in the various cases are already dead.
 The most important witness in the story after Mr. Hodges himself, his alleged commanding officer, Major James Hayworth, died of a heart attack in 2011. Two of the other three “CIA assassins” identified by Mr. Hodges are also dead, and the last one, Captain Keith McInnis, went missing in action in 1968 and is presumed dead.
 John Lennon was murdered bu the US Govt..due to his antiwar stance
 Sure these typed instances took place.Sad to say but we can’t claim any better than Hitler,Sadam,BinLaden.If someone hurt that poor girl,may they be setting with Adoph at this very moment.I often state ID do anything for my nation,but don’t think I could add injecting a helpless woman in her bed while she slept.Isnt the America I know.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/paul-mccartney-refutes-ringo-starrs-allegations-that-he-died-in-1966-3/
", Paul McCartney Refutes Ringo Starr’s Allegations that He Died in 1966," Ringo alleged that the “real” Paul had died in 1966 and had been replaced by a look-alike named Williams Shears Campbell, a claim which Paul dismisses as “the rambling of a senile old man”.
 Sir Paul decided to invite the media to his primary residence located on the outskirts of the small town of Peasmarsh, in Sussex, to refute the allegations and to put an end to the rumors which have been spreading and multiplying over the last few days.
 Sir Paul looked visibly tired and irritated during the press conference, appearing even aggressive at times.
 This denial by Paul McCartney will certainly not bring an end to this story, however, as many investigations have already been initiated to determine his true identity.
 After the British MI5’s announcement on Tuesday, the speaker for the Berlin public prosecutor’s office, Michael Grunwald, confirmed on Friday to reporters that the office is also investigating claims that  Sir Paul McCartney could be an impostor.
   This investigation in Berlin comes after Ringo’s allegations have brought an unexpected twist to a 31-year old paternity case in Germany, concerning Mr. McCartney.
   Back in 1983, Sir Paul was ordered to give blood samples for a DNA paternity test after Bettina Hübers claimed to be his illegitimate daughter.
   53-year old Bettina Hübers, who works as a caretaker at an old people’s home in Berlin, claims her mother, Erika Hübers, had an affair with the British musician between 1959 and 1962.
   At the time the Beatles were playing on Hamburg’s infamous
    Reeperbahn
   and hadn’t yet risen to fame.
 Ms. Hübers had a failed pop career under the name Tina McCartney, but Sir Paul has always denied he was her father, and the original paternity test backed up his claims.
 In 2007, however, she claimed that McCartney had faked the paternity test, as she alleged that a look-alike had taken Sir Paul’s place in the court case.
   After Ringo’s revelations, she now demands a DNA test to compare her own DNA with that of Paul’s brother, Peter Micheal McCartney, better known by his professional name of Mike McGear, to prove she is actually the daughter of the “real” Paul McCartney.
 Ms. Hübers still demands to be recognized as the daughter of the “real” Paul McCartney, which could make her eligible to receive hundreds of millions of dollars of inheritance.
 This strange controversy has been creating a lot of hype in the tabloids and the social media over the last week, after Ringo’s famous interview the Hollywood Inquirer.
 The former drummer of the Beatles had alleged that the “real” Paul McCartney had died in a car accident in November 1966 and had been replaced by the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest named William Shears Campbell.
 The DNA test with Paul’s brother will solve this mystery for once and all. You go Girl!

 “I know that Ringo is growing senile and losing his mind,”


 “but he doesn’t need to invent such idiotic stories to attract attention. He probably heard that Wings was about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of fame and he felt jealous. I’ve seen Ringo do and say many stupid things in my life, but this is one of the worst! If he’s so badly in need of media coverage, he could just invent crap about himself without implicating me in his delirium”

 “I have many proofs that Sir Paul isn’t really Sir Paul,”


 “The signature on the old court documents is false! We have found the signature is from a right-handed person, but Paul is left-handed. The sample isn’t even from the right blood type! I am sure that the man pretending to be Paul McCartney is in fact Billy Shears, and I want DNA testing on Paul’s brother, to clarify this matter once and for all”

", Former Beatle Ringo Starr Claims the “Real” Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and Was Replaced by Look-Alike," In an exclusive interview with the
  Hollywood Inquirer
 , Mr. Starr explained that the “real” Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9, 1966, after an argument during a Beatles’ recording session.
 To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who was the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul.
  “When Paul died, we all panicked!” claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. “We didn’t know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn’t get along with John, at all.”
 These pictures from 1966 show the great resemblance between Paul McCartney on the left, and William Shears Campbell on the right, at the time of McCartney’s alleged death.
 Mr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth.
 He notably says that the entire
  Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
 album was awash with Paul-is-dead clues: the Beatles had indeed officially formed a “new” band featuring a “fictional” member named Billy Shears, which happened to be the actual name of Paul’s replacement.
 Ringo Starr claims that he finally decided to tell the truth because he was afraid that it was going to die with him. At age 74, he is the only other surviving member of the famous band besides Paul McCartney, and he was afraid the deception would never be revealed.
 According to Ringo Starr, the cover of the Abbey Road album was a hidden message to the world, symbolizing a funeral procession. John Lennon, dressed in white, symbolizes the clergyman. Ringo Starr, dressed in black, symbolizes the undertaker. George Harrison, in denim jeans and shirt, symbolizes the gravedigger and McCartney, barefoot and out of step with other members of the band, symbolizes the corpse.
 The rumors of Paul’s death began more than 45 years ago but had always been dismissed as nonsense by the band and its entourage.
 In September 1969, American college students published a series of articles in which they claimed that clues to McCartney’s death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles’ recordings.
 Clue-hunting rapidly proved infectious, and within a few weeks, it had become an international phenomenon. Rumors only declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in
  Life
 magazine in November 1969.
 Neither Paul McCartney nor anyone from his entourage has commented Ringo Starr’s declaration yet, but the interview has already provoked a lot of reactions around the world.
 Journalists and paparazzi from around the world have surrounded the residence of the musician only minutes after the interview was broadcasted and are waiting for the star to comment the allegations.
 The British MI5 also announced an investigation to determine if an impostor could have indeed posed for 48 years as the Member of the Order of the British Empire, Sir James Paul McCartney, during official ceremonies involving Queen Elizabeth II.
 Dental records?
 “At age 74, he is the only other surviving member of the famous band besides Paul McCartney” Didn’t he say McCartney was dead?
 Paul being dead could be pulled off withe right amount of money anything can be done just ask the last 4 POTUS!!!…………

 William Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed “disappear” from records in 1966 and no traces of him can be found after Paul’s alleged death.

 “We felt guilty about the deception” added Ringo Starr. “We wanted to tell the world the truth, but we were afraid of the reactions it would provoke. We thought the whole planet was going to hate us for all the lies we had told, so we kept lying but sending subtle clues to relieve our conscience. When the first rumors finally began about the whole thing, we felt very nervous and started fighting a lot with each other. At some point, it was too much for John and he decided to leave the band.”

 Prince Harry had no comments about the latest events, but a spokesman for the Royal family assured reporters that “he hopes this woman gets help soon and that she is unharmed”.

 It is estimated she used over 30 cats to make one single fur coat and over 20 fur coats were found in her house during the arrest
 The retired fashion designer lured neighborhood cats with food and skinned them in her basement where she dried the skins.
 She also used the meat of the cats to lure other cats who unwittingly were eating their own species, a disgusting and cruel hobby admits local PETA spokeswoman Jane Churchill.
  “She has taken the lives of hundreds of cats just to make fur coats out of them, this is tragic. How would people react if someone made coats out of human skin? These cats are living beings and all living beings are equal to Mother Earth. I hope she goes to jail for a very long time”

 They have two sets of arms and legs and their own hearts and stomachs but share a lower digestive tract and a penis.
 This shared penis has become a major source of conflict between the twins over recent years, and Alfred is now going to court to keep his brother from masturbating.
 Alfred says he is suffering from insomnia and from a post-traumatic syndrome after waking up at night on three occasions to catch his brother masturbating.
 As for Wilbert, he claims he has done nothing wrong and insists that he has the legal right to masturbate.
 He said he waited for his brother to be asleep because he knew he was against it didn’t want to disturb or shock him.
 Wilbert’s lawyer, Michael Gallagher, says this trial threatens not only his client’s basic human rights, but also “the sexuality of all conjoined twins”.
 The two of them were facing each other in a specially adapted courtroom this morning in Flint, Michigan.
 Dozens of reporters were present to cover this unusual case, which should clarify many legal issues concerning the sexuality of conjoined twins.
 At the moment, the Michigan state law doesn’t include any guidelines for individuals sharing the same genital organs.
 Across the U.S., the only state to have a law concerning the sexuality of conjoined twins is California, which passed a bill in 2011.
 I was thinking he could roofie his brother, but I did not think that all the way through, lol.
 Seems that they would have worked this one out in their teen years, right?

 .
 Mr. Snowden says the CIA first orchestrated the spread of the “Global Warming scare” in the 1950s, in order to divert the attention of the scientific community, from the dangers of the weapons race and reinforce its control over research institutes.
 Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that the CIA invented the whole thing will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September 2016.
 Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA.
 In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.
 He also claims to be in possession of CIA documents, linking the agency to many illegal activities.
 The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public.
 He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.
 On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.
 He has since threatened to release other documents in his possession, which he claims would be far more embarrassing for the American government than the ones he has already rendered public.

 “I have documents showing that the CIA invented the whole thing,” claims Edward Snowden. “Global Warming was invented to both scare people, and divert their attention from other human-made dangers like nuclear weapons. The CIA gave millions of dollars to any scientist who would confirm the theory, so many unscrupulous scientists did what they were told in order to get the money. Now, there is so much fake data to confirm that Global Warming “exists”, that they actually convinced everyone that it was real.”

", USA: Man Accused Of Stealing 32 Tons of Bacon," The man would have elaborated a complex plot to divert for his personal use, from 20 to 250 kilograms of meat per week, from shipments destined to his branch of the restaurant chain.
 The man allegedly took advantage of his position to falsify orders and sales in order to hide the disappearance of the bacon from the company accounts and used his knowledge and control of the security cameras to be able to retrieve his loot without appearing on the tapes.
 The company would have started to suspect Mr. Turner in December 2013 after an anonymous denunciation, and had some new security cameras installed without informing him.
 Over the next few weeks, they captured incriminating images of the manager taking 10-kilogram bags of bacon and leaving with them on a regular basis.
 They then interrogated a few of the branch’s employees and understood that clearly, something shady was going on.
 The company’s legal department then took the decision to transfer the case and the evidence to the police, who rapidly arrested the accused.
 Mr. Turner now faces multiple criminal charges of embezzlement, fraud, and larceny, and faces a sentence of up to 88 years in prison if found guilty on all charges.
 The accused has already been fired by for his employer as soon as the arrest took place. The corporation explained the decision to lay him off, by the fact that the events constitute a “major breach of trust” between Wendy’s and Mr. Turner.
 More and more cases of bacon theft have been reported over the country over the last years, and the police seem powerless to explain or to stop this new crime spree.
 On February 3, 21-year old Gaige Lee Joyner was arrested by the Salisbury Police after he threw several cases of the tasty treat over a fence at Hendrix BBQ.
 In another case, 61-year old David Brown from Romford was arrested for stealing 14 packs of bacon from a grocery store in Ilford in February.
 He pleaded guilty on March 24 and was handed the 12-month conditional discharge.
 Mmmm….Bacon.
 No shame in his game!!!!!!!
 That’s one big booty
 Oh damn, that was one of my friends’s cousins

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/man-claiming-to-have-been-vladimir-putins-lover-killed-in-zurich/
", Man Claiming to Have Been Vladimir Putin’s Lover Killed in Zurich," According to the city’s police department, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot.
 “The police forces have only been able to proceed to preliminary analysis before we spotted a source of radiations on the scene and had to call a decontamination team” explains Sven Munger of the Zurich Police Department.
 “We can confirm that the radioactive agent is a very rare Russian product named TCDD Dioxin. The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects.”
 The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled “
  Я был любовник Путина
 ” (“
  I was Putin’s Lover
 “), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree.
 A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand for political asylum from the Helvetic state.
 Many sources also claim that Mr. Michaelevitch had dinner with an attaché of the Russian embassy five days before his body was found, a case strangely similar to that of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in 1999.
 Donald Trump is gay too. He and Putin have shared a bed and that’s at least 1 of the scary things Trump wants to keep hidden. Trump is in love and knows no one else will want or have wanted him (this excludes those being paid for the act). “Very sad”.
 I’ll bet my savings on it.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/teenager-sues-his-parents-for-250000-for-naming-him-gaylord/
"," Teenager sues his parents for $250,000 for naming him Gaylord"," Gaylord Williams from the small city of Kirksville in Missouri is suing his parents, Dave and Carol Williams, for “deliberately making his life miserable” by giving him “an outdated and prejudicial first name”.
 In his allocution presented this morning in front of the Adair County Circuit Court, the teenage boy claims he was an undesired child and that his parents deliberately gave him that first name to make him “a designated scapegoat”.
 He claims his parent’s ill-intentioned plan has worked, and that he has to endure constant mockeries and bullying because of his name.
 The young man has even been physically assaulted on several occasions and has even been hospitalized twice.
 He says he’s tried to get a name change in the past and asked his parents for their permission on several occasions, but they declined every time.
 He finally decided to file a lawsuit against his parents in order to obtain a financial compensation for the suffering that they deliberately caused him.
 His parents vehemently deny his allegations and claim that they simply named him Gaylord because they liked that name.
 Gaylord’s parents, Dave and Carol Williams, appeared extremely nervous when confronted by the media outside the Adair County Circuit Court this morning.
 Every year,  a few dozen young Americans launch civil lawsuits against their biological parents for various reasons.
 Many of these cases are cases designed as “wrongful birth lawsuits” and are often instituted by children with predictable birth defects.
 According to official records, this is the first time that American parents are being sued because of the name they gave their child.
 The actual hearings, in this case, are expected to begin in October.
 Ask his parents in court to be allowed to change his name and the reason why they decline
 I think that some parents don’t think the names through properly, it’s tough enough in life without being given a name that you are ridiculed for, speaks volumes that the parents wouldn’t let him change his name though.
 or lordofthegays williams, now that’s got a ring to it.
 What if he went and changed his name to lordgay instead?

", Doctors find dildo lost 45 years ago inside woman’s uterus after she complains about stomach aches," 71-year old Thelma Jennings presented herself at the hospital last weekend saying she suffered from unbearable belly aches.
 She told doctors that she had regularly felt pain over the years, but that it had grown much more acute over the last few weeks.
 Dr. George Truman performed a series of exams and scans before he noticed a strange object on the x-ray images.
 It turns out the dildo had been stuck in Ms. Jennings’ uterus for several decades, probably more than 45 years.
 Ms. Jennings says she never realized she had a dildo inside her and always thought she simply had digestion problems.
 Several hundred Americans show up in hospitals every year after sex toys or other objects get stuck in their body cavities.
 However, cases of objects remaining in such cavities for long periods of time are extremely rare.
 One case occurred in 2003 when a woman had a vibrator stuck inside of her for seven weeks before finally overcoming her shame and going to the hospital.
 An archeological dig in France in 2009 revealed the body of a 15th-century bishop who had seemingly spent the last 50 years of his life with a homemade wooden sex toy stuck in his rectal cavity.

  “As soon as I saw the shape of the object, I immediately knew what it was. I tried to ask her about it, but she denied using any type of sex toys for years.”
 

 
  “She told me that the last time she had used it, she was totally drunk and didn’t remember much. She said she spent hours looking for the toy all around her house without realizing it was inside her.”

", Man lost 200 pounds in six month by drinking menstrual blood," 38-year old Martin Sanders from Milwaukee in Wisconsin, weighted over 400-lbs a few months ago when he decided to try a new diet of his own design.
 Martin Sanders lost an incredible 225-lbs in six months thanks to his blood drinking diet.
 He began ingesting by ingesting small quantities of blood collected from his wife as part of a high-protein diet.
 After the promising results of the first week, he increased his blood collecting effort by asking his sisters, sisters-in-law, neighbors, and friends and was able to increase his consumption to 500 ml of blood per day.
 Mr. Sanders says that menstrual blood is exceptionally rich in iron and protein, making it an ideal ingredient for any weight loss diet.
 He claims that after the first week of his diet, he had already lost almost 40 pounds and had more energy than he had ever had before.
 The 38-year old man says he intends to fight the taboo that surrounds menstrual blood and help people accept it as a great weight-loss solution.
 Mr. Sanders’ unusual diet has generated a lot of reactions from health experts as well as on social media.
 Some nutritionists have confirmed that menstrual blood could theoretically be a good addition to a protein-rich diet, but warn about risks of possible bacteria.
 Professor Betty Williams whs teaches Health and Nutrition Sciences at UCLA believes that a diet based on menstrual blood represents a serious health hazard and should not be attempted by anyone.
 Several experts, however, have pointed out that human menstrual blood has basically the content as animal blood but is at higher risk of bacterial contamination.
 Most readers also seem grossed out by Mr. Sanders’ diet, denouncing as “ridiculous”, “sick” or “disgusting”.

", California: Pro-Choice activist proudly breaks world record by getting her 27th abortion," The historic operation was performed at the Sacramento Street Health Center and required Elena Travis, 34, to visit the abortion clinic three consecutive times because she was 24 weeks pregnant.
 Elena Travis, 34, a medical school student who hopes to one day perform abortions herself, believes abortion is a right and hopes to inspire other women to have it practiced on them by showing others that it is a safe and healthy procedure.
 Medical staff at the Sacramento Street Health Center required the abortion be performed in three consecutive operations due to the fact that Ms. Travis was 24 weeks pregnant at the time.
 Elena Travis had her first abortion at the age of 9 and says abortions have since been the ideal solution for her since she reacts negatively to birth control and emergency contraceptive pills.
 Although Travis says she loves the feeling of being pregnant and bearing life within her womb, she says she realizes that giving birth would only doom her child to “a life of misery and suffering” and be “an extra burden for the planet.”
 Other Pro-Choice activists on social media have even compared her to legendary feminists such as Margaret Sanger and Margaret Thatcher, although she claims she is just doing her part to make the world a better place.
 I think she’s hot!
 I’m pro choice, but WTF!? Lady is cuckoo for cock puffs. She obviously has psych issues. She loves that she can create life inside ber, if she truly belives life starts at conception, she’s just willfully murdering babies.that’s messed up. She should get sterilized.

 Briant said she first inserted the cell phone inside her vagina as a dare from one of her friends but quickly realized that the phone would not come out.
 Attorney Jim McAfee’s claims his client was forced to undergo a cesarean section to remove the cell phone because of the atypical shape of her pelvis and had no insurance at the time.
 A Samsung spokesman said they would not comment on this case at this moment but explained that an out-of-court settlement was still an option on the table.
 Apple faced a similar lawsuit in 2014 after a man had attempted to swallow fourteen iPhones and ended up in the emergency room for mercury poisoning.
 Apple was eventually forced to legally specify that their products were not fit for human consumption and the man was conceded an undisclosed amount of money.
 It wasn’t stuck in her vagina if she needed a c-section. Lord knows how the twat stuffed a phone all the way up her uterus, seeing as how your cervix is pretty well closed unless you’re giving birth. She should sue herself for getting her head stuck up her butt. Dumb birch.

 She is convinced that her unusual dietary supplement is responsible for her breast size.
 She says she has been collecting semen from several of her male friends, who have shown rather comprehensive and helpful.
 Jesabelle Monroe recommends her sperm drinking diet to all women who would like to have bigger breasts.
 Ms.Monroe says she is “almost satisfied” with her breast size and could abandon her diet in a year or two.
 Despite Ms. Monroe’s claims, no scientific evidence exists to prove that ingesting semen could increase a woman’s breast size.
 The biochemical content of semen suggests that ingesting may have several virtues, from anti-aging effects to stimulating intelligence.
 However, for ethical reasons, no large-scale research has ever been done on the subject.

 Mike Hunt, 24, was diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy since birth and luckily had an EpiPen when his allergic reaction to peanuts became evident moments during sexual intercourse.
 In an interview with a local television network, Jane Lee Hopkins, 21, admitted she was terribly sorry for spreading peanut butter on her genitals while knowing her boyfriend had a severe peanut allergy.
 Hopkins says she took to social media to tell her story because she felt remorseful and wanted to warn others not to repeat the incident.
 “It sounded like a great idea at first but now I understand it was extremely dangerous and not worth it, even though he’s cheated on me several times and I was furious at him,” she wrote on Instagram.
 Hopkins says she is currently working out her issues with her boyfriend and says the incident has made their relationship stronger and that they still plan to get engaged next year.

", Man sues strip club where he contracted syphilis after licking dance pole," The Oregon Herald reported Thursday that Mike Litte, 28, is seeking $500,000 in damages from the Apollo strip club.
 During the performance, one dancer apparently “squirted” on the dance pole, which Litte decided to lick before suffering from symptoms of syphilis days later.
 Candace Williams, an employee of the Apollo strip club, says she saw Litte in an intoxicated state jump onto the stage where he indulged in “French kissing” the dancing pole for several minutes.
 Andrew Smith, Mike Litte’s lawyer, believes the establishment’s lack of standards of hygiene is at fault here and that it was the dancer’s obligation to warn his client that she had an infectious disease.
 Mike Litte was also treated for symptoms of chlamydia and gonorrhea he also contracted that night.
 The owner of the strip club couldn’t be reached for comments but an employee reached by phone admitted that clients “licking the dance pole” was not a practice encouraged by the establishment.
 The lawsuit claims the Apollo strip club is liable for its employees and for maintaining minimal hygiene standards inside the establishment.
 Don’t Lick.Dance Poles
 Hmm I highly doubt that I bet he had STDs before he went to strip club you get it from having sexual intercourse. He could have been with a prostitute
 That was not a dance pole!It was my babymaker

", Hawaii: Scuba diver hospitalized after his penis gets stuck in giant clam," Sean Madison, 22, was transported to Ka’u hospital after suffering from severe breathing complications, vomiting, extreme swelling and low blood pressure.
 Doctors believe physical contact with the giant mollusk may have triggered his allergy to seafood and exposed him to high levels of arsenic.
 Madison, 22, whose condition has stabilized, said he inserted his penis inside the clam as a prank to impress his friend, Thomas Meyer.
 The amateur diver also admitted he was still hung over from the night before and had consumed GHB and ecstasy, which impaired his judgment at the time.
 After eventually releasing himself from the clam, the young man later developed a severe allergic reaction and was rushed to Ka’u Hospital.
 Dr. Andrew Smith at Ka’u Hospital believes Madison’s body reacted to the digestive enzymes of the giant mollusk, which was possibly trying to digest the man’s genitals at the time of the incident.
 Dr. Smith admits it is the first case of its kind he has seen in his 22 years of practice.
 A fatal incident occurred at the Waikiki Aquarium in Honolulu in 2014 when an aquarium employee put his head inside a giant clam and lost consciousness before he could be rescued, confirming the local reputation of the mollusk as a ‘killer clam’.
 In Hawaii folklore, the clam goddess Wawa U’ru was forcefully impregnated by A’ua A’uku, the shark god, but snapped the shark God’s genitals as revenge, leaving him emasculated and thus giving birth to the natives of Hawaii.

", Florida Man Falls Victim to Leprosy After Sex with Armadillo," The young man that is being hospitalized at the Central Florida Regional Hospital is suffering from an advanced condition that doctors have determined to be
  Hansen’s disease, or leprosy
 , an affliction that has seen a dramatic revival in southern states where 9 cases have already been diagnosed in Florida alone since last October,
  according to the Department of Health.
 Doctors interrogated family members after the disease had proliferated to the young man’s pubic area, an uncommon area of the body for the affliction to spread.
 Dr. James H. Potter, of the Central Florida Regional Hospital, says every reported case of leprosy this year involved people who were in direct contact with armadillos
 “At first glance, we tried to treat the affliction as an STD, but we soon realized our treatments were unsuccessful and the disease kept spreading more intensely until family members decided to tell us about the family animal” explains Dr. James H. Potter.
 “The family was afraid of legal consequences for the boy, but I’m glad they told us the entire story so that we can now treat him properly and prevent further spread of the disease” he added.
 The family members intervention might have saved the man’s life, believe experts.
 “Timothy always had a hard time interacting with others and making friends. He was always so keen about animals, so we decided to let him keep the animal after he had caught him last spring” admits Jane Whitestone, mother of the 22-year old man.
 “He was very fond of the little critter, he would spend all his time with him, even sleeping with him at night. We knew it was a bit awkward for a 22-year old to spend so much time with an armadillo, but he looked so happy, we never said a thing” she told local reporters.
  According to the Center for Disease Control, armadillos are the only animal to carry leprosy, a bacterial disease that affects the skin and nerves. The Health Resources and Services Administration has reported that there are currently about 6,500 cases of the disease in the U.S.
 “Transpecies Community” pigressives who brought aids and leprosy to humans, defy their biology per deviant rules of behavior, are entitled to morph mentally and act out their fantasies, say democrat activists.
 Hey ace only whites are into bestality and only trump sorrporters are white and dumbfucks cause trump could fart in your face and you’ll tell him it smells good

 The study concluded that “INAH [part of the hypothalamus] is dimorphic with sexual orientation, at least in men, and suggests that sexual orientation has a biological substrate”.

 «Injecting specific quantities of testosterone helps to upset this artificial biological unbalance which occurs mostly in part because of environmental pollution and an excess of estrogen mimickers in our modern environment» he adds.
 The new discovery has attracted much criticism from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations around the Globe, yet a few country leaders have outspokenly shown support and interest for the research. Iran, China, and Saudi Arabia have been the first countries to show interest in the new discovery.
 American and European researchers have expressed much skepticism upon receiving the news.
 Try and turn your sexuality off. Go ahead. Try and visualize sucking a dick if your a tits and ass kinda guy or muff diving into a untrimmed, winter ready bush if your a dick chick. You are who you are by nature, not choice. As for how I worded this, the comments were already beyond rude, and vulgar may actually be the key.
 Homosexuality is simply nature’s way of ensuring mentally defective humans don’t reproduce.
 This needs to be put in the water in Seattle and Edmonds in Washington state!
 Why not cure a disease instead of living with it? What is happening is abuse towards children who don’t know any better and having their body parts cut off? It’s disgusting and I’m ashamed of what humans have evolved to. We won’t be able to tell what is what. Do you see how this is not a good idea? This isn’t hate speech only love for the human race and the cure.
 it’s our choice to be who we want to be. No ‘cure’ is gonna stop that. you dick heads!! Homosexuality is totally fine. GO GET A LIFE
 oof
 come on man just deal with it

", Obese couple makes three-story fall after floor collapses during sex," Michael Davis and Theresa Walker from Liverpool were having sex in their bedroom on the third floor of an apartment building when the structure collapsed.
 The couple and their bed fell through three floors before bursting through a wall and ending up in a laundry room in the basement of the building.
 Emergency services were rapidly called on the site and they were able to extract the unlucky lovers from their uncomfortable position.
 Miraculously, the couple suffered only light injuries and no other residents of the building were injured as almost half of the 250-year old building collapsed.
 Tom Watson, another resident of the building, claims the accident was predictable and could have been avoided.
 Mr. Watson says the landlord was aware of the situation but did nothing to correct it.
 Indeed, the two apartments below the couple have been unoccupied for months, a fact that explains the absence of casualties.
 Tom Watson, who also resided in the building before the accident, says the collapse could have been avoided.
 The Liverpool City Police has opened an investigation and some forensic engineers have been called to the site to determine the exact cause of the collapse.
 Depending on the conclusions of the investigation, the landlord could possibly face criminal accusations of criminal negligence causing physical harm.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/chinese-restaurant-accused-of-stealing-and-cooking-dozens-of-dogs/
", Chinese restaurant accused of stealing and cooking dozens of dogs," Agents of both the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) accompanied the police officers who searched “
  White Lotus Royal Buffet
 “, looking for dog meat.
 Large quantities of dog meat were found on the site and taken to a forensic lab to be analyzed.
 According to the NYPD spokesman, Captain Fred Jameson, the owner of the restaurant, Tengdo Hueng, admitted snatching dogs from the area with his 16-year old son and killing them for meat.
 For more than a year, most telephone posts in the neighborhood have been covered with posters of various missing dogs.
 Stray dogs have been disappearing for years in the Chinatown and Little Italy area of Manhattan, but pet dogs have also been disappearing since January 2016.
 A total of 12 dogs were reported missing on January 27, on the day before the Chinese New Year celebration.
 More animals went missing over the next months, and rumors of a “serial dog killer” began circulating in Southern Manhattan.
 According to the Humane Society of New York, more than 150 dogs have disappeared within a 1-mile radius of the restaurant in 2016 and almost 100 in the first months of 2017.
 According to police, the accused and his son hunted dogs with nets, lassos, and crude spears, and could have killed hundreds of dogs.
 The NYPD believes the restaurant owner has been killing and cooking abandoned animals for years but had to begin snatching dogs directly from their owners’ backyards when his business expanded.
 Despite this large quantity of missing animals, the police have only been able to charge Mr. Hueng with the killing of 11 animals.
 He now faces a total of 47 criminal charges and a maximum of 95 years in prison. He should appear in court in June.
 Cook that S.O.B and send him back to China
 Who the sick fucker by the name of Nicholas maKing a comment about how good dogs meat taste bbq..i hope some one get this little evil and cook him in the boiling water
 Horrible. An served it probably to white people who might have been dog lovers.
 Dog meat is excellent on the BBQ, very tender.
 Criminal. Put your but on the grill.
 Don’t forget that this has been allowed to happen for a long time’since 2014 but they were only allowed to eat three dogs a week and they got greedy’ hahaha
 I hope they face the full jail sentences they deserve for their acts of intentional cruelty and killing of dogs. Whether these dogs were homeless or not, they are still intelligent and sentient beings.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/man-breaks-into-a-burger-king-and-drinks-gallons-of-deep-frying-oil/
", Man breaks into a Burger King and drinks gallons of deep frying oil," The Miami Police Department received a call for a break-in at a Burger King restaurant around 2 A.M. and some officers were on the site in a matter of minutes.
 Upon arriving at the restaurant, they found 510-lb Romeo Carter, chugging down oil directly from the deep fryers. The 41-year old man has already ingested dozens of gallons of cooking oil but was still drinking it with an apparently unquenchable thirst.
 He was arrested on the site and accused of burglary, criminal trespass, theft by unlawful taking and criminal mischief.
 Many officers of the Miami Police Department were still on the site this morning to gather evidence and complete the investigation.
 Mr. Carter was released on bail this afternoon, and he briefly met with the
  Miami Inquirer
 to explain his ordeal.
 Mr Carter faces a total of 35 years in jail, but he’s already offered to pay for all the damage he caused and Burger King could possibly agree to a settlement and accept to drop the charges.
 If the charges are maintained, he is expected to appear at the Miami-Dade County courthouse on May 8.
 he looks like peter griffin from family guy
 wow what a fatass pig anymore he’ll explode
 He just wanted to run his bio diesel engine installed in his ass
 why, just why
 Surely if you’re going to cheat on a diet you should at least do it by eating something which tastes good. I wouldn’t want to be there when all of that oil comes back up

", Woman Loses 180 Pounds In 30 Days After Miracle Microwave Diet," Jane Lauren, a stay-at-home mother of six, admits having lost so much weight in so little time has dramatically changed her perspective on life and how others look at her.
 Before she embarked on this highly controversial microwave diet, Jane was very skeptical about using a microwave to lose weight, but just a few days into the experiment rapidly shook her suspicions away.
 “I was of those loony people who think microwaves emit toxic radiation that gives you cancer” she admits. “I don’t know if that holds up scientifically but for the benefits it has given me, I’ll never stop eating from the microwave” she adds, visibly proud of her recent accomplishment.
 Surprisingly enough, the woman claims she can even eat fast food in her diet, “as long as it has gone through the microwave”, landing her a prestigious publicity deal with international fast food chain restaurant Wendy’s.
 U.S. Food And Drug Administration (FDA) attests that microwave cooking is safe and does not reduce the nutritional value of foods any more than conventional cooking. In fact, foods cooked in a microwave oven may keep more of their vitamins and minerals, because microwave ovens can cook more quickly and without adding water.
 Anyone who belives this should have their head exzamend no way this can happen. I cook from the micorwave all the time and i havent lost any weight

", Saudi Arabia: Man’s hand cut off for masturbating during Ramadan," The man caused a commotion last week as he exhibited his genitals while masturbating during prayer time in a large mosque of the Al Bahah area, creating a wave of panic amongst fellow worshippers who exited the mosque in great numbers reports the Riyad Herald.
 The man’s family that claims that he is sick and possessed by an evil

 (spirit) also said he had no control over his left hand and masturbated often, even while reading the Quran, during prayer time and at the mosque.
 “We were also ordered to kill most of our goats because he had
  haraam
 (improper) relations with them. My son’s disease has brought shame and poverty to our family,” she added in tears.
 Amputation is usually reserved for thieves according to Sharia law but in this case, the judge decided that amputation could be of help to the man’s “obscene conduct.”
 Judge Muhammad Al-Wahari’s decision to amputate was received as a merciful one for the severity of the crime.
 “Although the disruptive nature and the obscenity of the crime should be harshly punished, I will be tolerant in my judgment and only condemn the accused to be amputated of his left hand,” judge Al-Wahari said in court.
 The judge also advised 600 lashes for incommoding the members of the mosque and highly suggested consulting an exorcist to treat the young man’s “indecent and obscene behavior”.

", Postman with eating disorder arrested for eating 1.3 tons of mail," 38-year old Diego Ramirèz was arrested at his residence around 7:15 AM by officers of the New York Police Department and deputies of the New York City Sheriff’s Office (NYCSO).
 A joint investigation led over the last few months after several people complained about their mail being stolen, revealed that the letter carrier was actually eating a large portion of the envelopes he was supposed to deliver.
 In a press conference a few hours later, NYPD Chief of Department Tom Salinger said the arrest came after a 2-month joint investigation between the NYPD and the NYCSO.
 According to Chief Salinger, the accused confessed to eating thousands of pieces of mail almost immediately after his arrest.
 NYPD Chief of Department Tom Salinger says this is one of the strangest cases he has seen in his 27-year career.
 A total of 1500 criminal charges have already been filed against Mr. Ramirèz, including 640 charges mail theft and as 820 charges of malicious destruction of property.
 According to the NYPD, more charges could be added over the next few days.
 If found guilty on all accounts, the accused could have to pay a fine of almost $200 million and spend the rest of his life in prison.
 During the first court appearance this afternoon, Mr. Ramirèz’s lawyer Robert MacInnis, demanded a psychiatric evaluation for his client.
 He also pleaded that Diego Ramirèz wasn’t criminally responsible for his actions because of his mental disorder and had no intention to harm anyone.
 Both the prosecution and the court agreed to the demand, so the case will be reported until Mr. Ramirèz can undergo a complete psychiatric evaluation.
 It would be Nirvana for him if Sears and Penney’s still had catalogs by mail.
 He ain’t get a paper cut??? 😂😂😂

  “At first, we really thought someone was stealing some of our New Yorkers’ mail for profit. The investigators were amazed when they caught Mr. Ramirèz tearing the letters to pieces and eating them!”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/death-row-inmate-eats-an-entire-bible-as-his-last-meal/
", Death row inmate eats an entire Bible as his last meal," The prison guards of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility thought he wanted to pray and repent, so they gave him an old copy of the King James Bible.
 Against all expectations, the condemned murderer began tearing up the holy book and eating it.
 It took hours of chewing and swallowing small pieces of paper, but Mr. Morris ate the totality of the 1200-page book, including the cover.
 Walter Henri, the prison guard who handed him the old and worn out Bible, says the inmate seemed to “savor every bite”.
 Holman Prison director, Frank Davis, says the staff decided to let the prisoner eat the Bible because it didn’t violate the establishment’s “last meal policy”.
 Director Davis says the guards were surprised to see Mr. Morris ingest the Bible, but did not feel the need to intervene.
 In most states and various countries where the death penalty is legal, it’s customary to give sentenced prisoners a special last meal at their request.
 Restrictions do apply, concerning mostly the legality, the accessibility and value of the meal.
 Despite its unusual nature, Mr. Morris’ choice of meal was “locally accessible and worth less than 40$”, making it conform to the rules of Alabama correctional facilities.
 Jeremy Morris is expected to be executed tomorrow for the killing of two Catholic nuns in 2007.
 Awesome GOD loves it I know
 both of you are dum as a box of rocks
 I want too try this

", Woman arrested for training squirrels to attack her ex-boyfriend," The victim, 51-year-old James Robinson, was presumably attacked by the rodents on more than a dozen occasions over the last month.
 These attacks caused him many serious injuries, including the loss of two fingers and one testicle, bitten off by his attackers.
 The poor man had no idea why squirrels kept attacking him until he saw his ex-girlfriend, a former circus animal trainer, cheering the animals during one of the attacks.
 Realizing that his life could be in danger, Mr. Robinson filed a complaint with the police who later paid a visit to Ms. Smith.
 In her residence, they found a dozen cages, holding a total of 27 squirrels. They also found two training dummies with pictures of Mr. Robinson taped over their faces.
 Detroit Police Chief James Craig confirmed that Janice Smith had admitted that she was responsible for the attacks and confessed her strange plot.
 The 45-year old woman is now facing a variety of criminal charges linked to criminal harassment and using animals as weapons.
 DPD Chief James Craig admitted this morning in a press conference, that this case was probably the strangest that he’d seen in his career.
 Janice Smith’s lawyers have demanded for her to undergo a psychological evaluation, claiming that she was unfit to stand trial.
 They say that her choice of training squirrels instead of dogs or bears suggests that she might be suffering from mental problems.
 If she is judged fit to stand trial, Ms. Smith will be facing a maximum of 65 years in prison.

 “Ms. Smith confessed to capturing and training squirrels to harass and attack her ex-boyfriend. She used to train lions for a circus, so it was easy for her to make the animals do as she wanted. She said she hoped to raise an army of up to 50 or 100 animals.”

  96-hour-long surgical procedure
 costing him $1,260,000 in medical fees with no insurance.
 Surgeons were forced to remove one of Blair’s testicles as well as the top section of his penis, requiring 37 stitches and leaving him practically impotent
   because of his inability to maintain an erection more than several seconds.
 Attorney Peter Phelps claims his client’s permanent injury could have been prevented if a label or warning had been included by the company with the Dyson device.
 Attorney Peter Phelps also claims his client has never fully recovered from his injuries and that he is unable to participate in the activities or pleasures of life that he formerly enjoyed.
 In 2012, a similar lawsuit was filed against hand dryer manufacturer Excel Dryer after a seventeen-year-old had gotten his penis stuck in a high school washroom hand dryer.
 Excel Dryer was eventually forced to legally specify not to introduce objects of any nature, including body parts, into their products and the teenager’s parents were conceded an undisclosed amount of money.

", Man divorces Caucasian wife after DNA test proves he is of 9% African descent," Jeffrey McAllister, 37, claims that racial tensions arose in the couple after learning about his sub-African origins and kept putting a strain on their sixteen-year relationship.
 “The culture gap was just too important. She just couldn’t understand the suffering my people have endured for centuries from the hands of her people,” he explained.
 McAllister cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the break up as well as a “lack of understanding” of the culture and history of oppression of the Afro-American community of which he is a member.
 McAllister has also recently become a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and plans to enroll in an online Ebony class to reach out to his Afro-American community.
 Although McAllister admits that learning about his sub-African origins has profoundly impacted his life, and even though he has lost a wife in the process, he admits to developing a “profound an everlasting bond” with the Afro-American community which he now considers as his “true family.”

 O’Keefe came out publicly about his trans-speciesism when he was 35 after he realized his marriage was not working and that he could no longer lie to himself about his true identity.
 James O’Keefe, 42, who identifies himself as a turkey, wants to educate the American people about the murdering of millions of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day, which he says is a tragedy worse than the Jewish holocaust because “it happens every year.”
 O’Keefe is starting his 100-day hunger strike on Thanksgiving Day and hopes to raise awareness amongst the American population and politicians in Washington so that “the worst tragedy in the history of humanity” will stop being perpetuated every year.
 O’Keefe also claims over 245 million turkeys are raised in “concentration camp-like conditions” each year by American farmers.
 According to statistics from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) an estimated 45 million turkeys will be killed this year as a result of high demand for the annual feast of Thanksgiving Day.
 He’s right about one thing, tho. ‘O’Keefe also claims over 245 million turkeys are raised in “concentration camp-like conditions” each year by American farmers.’ That’s cruel and inhumane treatment.

", Billionaire widow bequeathes $1.6B to her dog to punish her children," Barbara Smith, who inherited more than 1.4B$ from her late husband in 2009, died from a breast cancer in October.
 Her six children had been waiting for weeks to hear from her notary about her will and their possible heirlooms and finally decided to contact him.
 They learned that their mother had bequeathed the totality of her possessions to her pet dog, including 7 residences, over 40 cars, and a 120-ft long yacht.
 Ms. Smith even specifically indicated in her will that everything was to be “burned to the ground if ⌈her⌉ selfish and useless children tried to contest ⌈her⌉ will and obtain it”.
 Robert Smith, the oldest of the six siblings, says their mother was clearly irrational when she prepared her will and that they are actually considering their legal options.
 He says his mother was mean, malicious and simply unbearable, and that her will is just another proof of her cruelty.
 The eldest of the six children, Robert Smith, says his sibling and him intend to contest their mother’s will, despite her orders to burn everything if they did.
 This isn’t the first time that a pet inherits a large amount of money, but this is by far the largest heirloom ever bequeathed to an animal in the United States.
 The former record was held by a Florida woman who left over 61M$ to her goldfish named Max in 2014.
 Another famous case of pet inheritance was Michael Jackson’s chimpanzee Bubbles who inherited over $2 million after his master’s death.
 However, neither of these animals were nearly as rich as Ms. Smith’s Jack Russell who now owns over $1.4B in stock options and over $180M in real estate property.

 Clementine Gibbons, 64, is suing the zoo’s administration after she claims she was sexually assaulted by the huge beast after she was returning home that night.
 “It ran towards me, pushed me to the ground and just jumped on me, grunting,” she recalls, visibly still traumatized.
 Gibbins says the 2,800-pound animal finally ejaculated after she tried rubbing his penis with her feet and eventually left her alone.
 Asheboro locals first tried to capture the massive 1.4-ton semiaquatic mammal before zoo staff finally intervened.
 Helena Cozumel, professor of biology at the University of North Carolina, believes Gibbins is lucky to be alive after only suffering from multiple fractured ribs and a light concussion, according to doctors.
 “He possibly mistook her for a small female hippopotamus because it was dark and was extremely sexually aroused because of all that time spent alone in captivity,” she explains.
 No North Carolina Zoo official has yet commented upon the lawsuit but a park spokesman told reporters the “complaint is being dealt with extremely seriously” and that “security issues are a main priority” at the moment.

 The young woman allegedly lost control of the parked vehicle after inserting the gear shift inside her vagina in what she described herself as an ultimate attempt to “stop being horny.”
 Deputy Sheriff Jeff Maloney of the Bowling Green Police Department hopes minors and adult drivers alike will heed his warning not to mix alcohol and drugs with driving which “can end with dramatic consequences such as in this case,” he said during a press conference.
 The teenager who had indulged in several drugs and alcohol at a local party the night of the accident was told by a number of people to leave after she was acting like “a cat in heat” and “rubbing her ass on the floor” according to another attendee of the party.
 The young woman who was brought into the Bowling Green Medical Center for medical attention early in the morning showed no sign of health complications, said doctors.
 Under Kentucky state law, the minor’s driver’s license will be revoked until she reaches 18 and may be required to attend mandatory alcohol or drug treatment.

 “It seems apparent the intake of alcohol and drugs were responsible for this person to be extremely sexually aroused and partake in sexual intercourse with the gear shift and lose control of the vehicle” Deputy Sheriff, Jeff Maloney, told reporters.

 “I should never have allowed her


 to


 leave the party in that state but she kept rubbing her genitals on every doorknob. She was totally out of control,” one friend of the teenager told a reporter when reached by phone.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/500-lbs-woman-kills-worlds-oldest-tortoise-by-accidentally-sitting-on-it/
", 500-lbs woman kills world’s oldest tortoise by accidentally sitting on it," The famous Seychelles giant tortoise lived on the grounds of Plantation House, the official residence of the island’s Governor, and belonged to the government of Saint Helena since 1882.
 According to the Saint Helena Police Service, 47-year old Margaret Sanders was visiting Plantation House with her family when her legs began to hurt and she needed to rest.
 The 520-lbs woman began looking for a place to sit down, and unfortunately confused the venerable animal with a decorative bench and decided to sit on it.
 Ms. Sanders’ weight was too important for the tortoise’s carapace and it immediately began cracking up, crushing the animal underneath.
 The site’s veterinarian, Dr. Frank Hollins, arrived less than a minute later, but Jonathan had already died of suffocation.
 Dr. Hollins was visibly emotional when he described the scene in an interview with the BBC, only hours after the incident.
 The veterinarian describes Jonathan’s death as a great loss for Saint Helena and the entire world.
 Dr. Hollins spent the last 32 years of his life caring for Jonathan and other tortoises on the Plantation House property. He described the 185-year old tortoise’s death as a great loss for the world.
 Jonathan was famous around the world as the oldest known land animal and had already appeared in several media over his very long life.
 The elderly tortoise was both a member of an endangered species, a major tourist attraction and a government property, so Margaret Sanders was immediately arrested and detained by the island’s police.
 She could face a variety of criminal charges, including the reckless destruction of government property, animal cruelty and even poaching.
 The Saint Helena Police Service has confirmed that multiple accusations should be filed over the next few days, once investigators have met with all witnesses of the incident.
 that is sad… =( didn’t she recognized by the look of it that it’s a tortoise.

 “When I saw that fat Lady on Jonathan, I started cursing and swearing at her, I couldn’t help myself. She just stared at me with a blank stare. It took minutes before she realized that her ‘bench’ was bleeding.”

 
  “Animals who live that old are extremely rare. It’s a catastrophe to have a nearly 200-year old animal die because of human stupidity.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/elderly-man-accused-of-bribing-a-police-officer-for-giving-a-biscuit-to-a-police-dog/
", Elderly man accused of bribing a police officer for giving a biscuit to a police dog," According to the police report, Walter Dryden was sitting on a bench and feeding pigeons in one of the city’s public parks when a canine unit of SJPD arrived to search for drugs that were reportedly hidden on the site.
 As the police dogs came near him, the old man stood up and despite multiple shouted warnings, gave a biscuit to one of them.
 Mr. Dryden was immediately handcuffed and brutally arrested in front of a dozen witnesses.
 Alicia Walters who was in the park with her two children at the time of the arrest described the scene in an interview with a local radio channel.
 According to Ms. Walters, Mr. Dryden visits the park every day and is frequently brings some bread crumbs for the pigeons and some biscuits for the dogs.
 Officer James White, says his partner Rufus was taking part in an important police operation when he was interrupted and that the arrest was totally justified.
 Mr. Dryden faces a total of six criminal charges including attempting to bribe a police officer, hindering a police officer in the execution of their duties and resisting his arrest.
 If found guilty on all charges, he could be sentenced to a fine of up to $500,000 and a maximum of 115 years in prison.
 His lawyer, Mr. Frank Wilson, denounced the arrest as “abusive and unnecessarily violent”, saying his client had no criminal intent and offered no resistance.
 Mr. Wilson says the elderly man is “almost completely deaf” and simply never heard the policemen’s shouted warnings.
 Walter Dryden was freed on a $5,000 bail a few hours later and should be back in court in December for the beginning of his trial.
 Oh my God! Yoda exists!
 James White….. You need another job. Your partner does as well. He should be charged with accepting a bribe and be suspended from law enforcement.. YOU.. Should be put on neighborhood Patrol Duty…. OR, removed from Law Enforcement totally. YOU are the cause of this entire situation, and should be made financially responsible for all the old fellas expenses… Especially Legal and Bail fees..
 He’s 92 years old. He’s almost completely deaf. The whole case is preposterous. He should be let off with an apology for the excessive force and put on probation.
 115 years is totally disproportionate. I accept that he should have been aware of the importance of not doing what he did, but 2 years is surely enough.
 People need to be taught a lesson, I agree. He quite possibly ruined a drug bust by his criminal act, so deserves to be jailed for sure. He may have done it deliberately to hinder police. Old people think they can get away with anything.
 Look in the mirror…. YOU are part of the problem. How the hell could he have known what was going on..???

", Texas man admits kidnapping 79 people to anally probe them while disguised as an alien," 73-year old Arnold White was arrested after a joint investigation led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the El Paso Sheriff’s Office and the El Paso Police Department.
 Originally interrogated about 4 crimes committed in the region in the 1990s, the retired trucker confessed a total of 79 kidnappings across California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas over a period of 40 years.
 Mr. White confessed to using a mix of hallucinatory drugs containing LSD and PCP to subdue his victims, before approaching them and carrying them inside his truck to assault them.
 In order to confuse his victims even more, he had set up the inside of his truck to look like an operating room and would wear an alien costume.
 FBI spokesman Darrell Johnson described the abuse that the accused afflicted to his victim as extremely disturbing.
 According to Mr. Johnson, most of the victims were loners and marginals, a fact that helped Mr. White evade arrest for so long.
 FBI spokesman Darrell Johnson described the accused’s stratagem as extremely elaborate and described him as “a dangerous predator”.
 Arnold White now faces a total of 347 criminal charges, including several charges of kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault by use of drugs, oral copulation by anesthesia or controlled substance, assault with intent to commit a sexual offense, and possession of a controlled substance
 He could face a term of more than 382 years to life in prison if found guilty of all counts.
 The 73-year old was denied bail this morning and will remain in detention until the beginning of his trial in January.

 El Paso, Texas | A man who was arrested by the FBI Yesterday has confessed to kidnapping and sexually assaulting several dozen people while using costumes, drugs, and special effects to have his victims believe they had been abducted by aliens.

 “He would insert fingers and objects in their various body cavities. He had even created his own sex toys designed to look like alien tools and medical instruments.”

 
  “He chose victims who were gullible and might fall for his traps. Several of his victims were actually ufo investigators he found hanging out around Area 51 or Roswell.”

 Betty Morris, the 911 operator who took the call, says she first thought it was a hoax when the young man described the situation.
 Ms. Morris dispatched police officers on the site, where they found Mr. Ramirez and the two pounds of cocaine he had left.
 In a press conference held a few hours later, LAPD spokesman Mark Knight confirmed that the accused had given tons of information which could lead to several arrests.
 LAPD spokesman Mark Knight described the arrest as “one of the easiest in American history” and said an investigation has been launched to determine the origin of the drugs.
 Mr. Sanchez now faces a total of 17 charges including drug trafficking, possession with intent to distribute, use and possession of drug paraphernalia and being a felon in possession of a firearm.
 If found guilty on all charges, he could spend up to 85 years in jail and pay a $450,000 fine.

", Woman goes blind after Syphilis-ridden brother pranks her with facial cum shot," Eleana Thompson, 34, was apparently sleeping when her brother, James Thompson, decided to ejaculate in her left eye as a prank, not knowing he had contracted Syphilis after a recent trip to Thailand where he admits having unprotected anal sex.
 After a severe rash developed in her eye and the irritation became unbearable, a visit to the emergency room determined that she was infected with Syphilis, according to doctors.
 James Thompson told reporters he felt horrible about his sister losing her eyesight in what apparently was only meant to be a practical joke.
 Even if the tragic accident has left Eleana with her vision impaired, she still doesn’t blame her brother for what happened.
 “When I was young, he would sometimes sit on my head bare-ass and fart into my mouth or ejaculate on my homework and in my school books,” she remembers.
 “People often find James weird or even call him a freak, but I think they are just homophobic. He is my only brother and I will always love him,” she added.
 Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease normally contracted from the sores of an infected person during sexual intercourse, including anal, vaginal and oral sex and unless treated timely and properly Syphilis can cause serious complications and, eventually, death.
 Poor lady! What man would do this to anyone let alone his sister?
 What a low down scum this guy is! I hope his sister sues him so that he can never have a thing in life.
 I just hope the sister get’s better and regains her eyesight.
 WTF kind of family is this!? This is NO “simple” prank. Let alone between brother ams sister. These two have some serious issues!
 This is disgusting and definitely not a prank. They should both be disgusted with themselves.

", White man asked black friend to impregnate his wife to fight “white privilege”," Peyton Wesley, 43, has convinced one of his African-American employees to become the biological father to his child because he feels ashamed of the privileged status he has endured all his life as a white Caucasian male.
 Tyrone DeAndre, 36, who works at the cement manufacturer where Wesley is an executive manager, says he was first surprised by the demand but eventually was convinced to do it.
 “At first, I thought he was crazy. I mean, I barely knew the guy. But he told me I was the only black guy he knew. He seemed really desperate” he admitted, visibly still in shock.
 “As long as I wouldn’t have to pay for child support, I said I wouldn’t mind,” he eventually conceded.
 Tyrone DeAndre, a cement manufacturer worker, told KATU ABC 2 he was eventually convinced by executive manager Peyton Wesley to impregnate his wife for an undisclosed amount of money.
 Although Peyton Wesley would not say publicly how much he gave to Tyrone DeAndre in financial retribution for becoming the biological father of his first child, he did finally admit the amount was in the six figures.
 “As a white man, my life has been so easy. I come from an average middle-class family and had the opportunity to climb the social ladder and build myself a successful career over the years,” he told reporters.
 “But something didn’t feel right. I felt guilty of all this wealth and I wanted to give back to others who did not have this privileged life I have been blessed to have simply because I was born with this specific skin color” he explained, visibly emotional.
 Although Tyrone DeAndre originally had only worked at the factory for a few months before Wesley proposed him his surprising demand, Wesley says DeAndre, he and his wife have grown very fond of each other over the past year and hopes DeAndre will play an important role in his child’s life in the future.
 Peyton has demonstrated evidence that the progressive apparatus nibbles away at the weak-minded first. As for his wife, well, I’ll bet this wasn’t her first time fornicating outside her race, and certainly won’t be her last. As for her value to society, an automobile accident fatality would have saved a great deal in future welfare expenses and the negative effect of the softening of American intellectual ability.

 “It’s not every day that one of your bosses asks you to impregnate his own wife,” Tyrone DeAndre told reporters.

", Georgia man kept deceased mother in freezer for years for “casual sex”," Owen O’Reilly, 47, was arrested yesterday after neighbors warned authorities that the suspect was washing his naked mother with a hose in his backyard.
 O’Reilly’s mother, Margaret O’Reilly, passed away in late 2015 unknowingly to neighbors who were surprised to see her bathing naked in an inflatable pool in her backyard while being hosed by her 47-year-old son.
 “I saw Margaret lying naked in an inflatable pool with Owen hosing her off,” described one neighbor, visibly shocked.
 “I hadn’t seen Margaret since she had left for the hospital two years ago and now I see her naked, lying in an inflatable pool in her backyard. It just didn’t make sense,” he told reporters.
 Police Officer James Durham of the Dunwoody Police Department first arrived on the scene to find O’Reilly “hosing off his deceased mother” he told reporters.
 O’Reilly told officers he originally kept his mother’s body to collect her welfare checks but also admitted under pressure that he occasionally indulged in sexual activities with the corpse after trace amounts of sperm were discovered on the body.
 “She is dead, she can’t feel anything,” he reportedly told Deputy Sheriff Johnson.
 According to Georgia State law, a person convicted of any sexual act with a dead human body involving the sex organs of the one and the mouth, anus, penis, or vagina of the other shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than ten years.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/china-fertility-clinic-accused-of-inseminating-women-with-pig-semen/
", China: Fertility clinic accused of inseminating women with pig semen," Between June 2016 and March 2017, a total of 86 women who had paid 50,000 yuán ($7,700) to be inseminated with sperm from “candidates carefully selected from the Chinese elite” were instead fertilized with swine semen.
 Only 4 of these women actually got pregnant, and all of them miscarried before the end of their pregnancies.
 One of these aborted fetuses was so deformed a doctor who saw it demanded an autopsy, and it was revealed that the embryo was part human and part animal.
 A police investigation then led to the discovery of an unusual fraud involving the
  Rhinoceros Horn Fertility Clinic
 and six of its employees.
 They discovered that the clinic was purchasing pig semen from farmers in a nearby village and using it to fertilize its customers.
 During the investigation of the clinic’s dozens of refrigerated containers, the scientific police discovered over 80 samples of pig semen.
 The animal semen was labeled was labeled as “platinum quality” and, surprisingly, sold at a higher price than “regular quality” human semen.
 Six employees of the clinic were arrested in March and all of them were found guilty yesterday by the Lanzhou state court.
 The director of the clinic, Mr. Wong Hu Chan, was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for his responsibility in the fraud.
 He admitted in his testimony that he had planned this unusual scheme in order to cope with the constant shortages of “high-quality semen”, which is hard to find in China.
 The clinic’s two doctors were respectively sentenced to 15 years and 20 in prison, while two of the nurses were sentenced to ten years and one to eight years.
 Four other employees of the clinic had first been suspected, but the investigation showed that they were not aware of the scheme.
 Mr. Wong Hu Chan, the director of the clinic, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the crimes.
 Fertility clinics are barely regulated in China and a handful of other disturbing incidents have occurred over the last few years.
 In 2011, a  fertility clinic in Shanghai was found guilty of diluting its semen with a mix of yak milk and bat guano, a mixture that is believed to improve fertility according to traditional Chinese medicine.
 In that particular case, four women had died from infections linked to the mixture and the doctor who had performed the interventions was sentenced to death.

", Qatar: Jealous Husband Seals Wife’s Vagina with Crazy Glue," The 33-year-old man was brought forth before the court after his wife was rushed off to the emergency room and suffered medical complications and excruciating pain.
 He confessed to the judge that he was guilty of gluing her genitals but only because he believed she had adulterous ideas after he found out she had liked a post of his 12-year-old cousin on Facebook.
 The man was brought before the court after accusations by the wife’s family of damaging her reproductive organs and risking to make her infertile.
 According to Judge Muhammad Bin Saden of the Qatari court of Justice in Doha, the husband did unjustly bring harm to his wife, although his reasons were “well-intentioned” but put into action in an “awkward way” he said.
 Also, the judge pointed out that, after going through the evidence and photos the husband had brought to court, the suffering was in part justified but still decided the woman should be administered 100 lashes as to prevent further “misunderstandings” between her and her husband.
 The husband was sentenced to pay 40 Riyal ($10 US dollars) and prevented to use any sort of glue or adhesive on his wife ever again.
 100 lashes to avoid future misunderstandings is a little light.
 She gets 100 lashes for part of her shoe showing. What a bunch of babaric people.

", Woman sues ex-roommate for $1.2m for training her parrot to sexually harass her," 26-year old Sarah Johnson from Louisville in Kentucky claims that her former roommate, 27-year old Steven Moore, caused her psychological and emotional trauma by pushing her pet parrot to sexually harass her.
 According to the complaint, Mr. Moore taught the plaintiff’s bird, an orange-winged amazon parrot named Kiki, several short sentences of sexual nature, which the animal began repeating tirelessly.
 Ms. Johnson kicked Mr. Moore out of their apartment after only six months but says Kiki continued harassing her for almost 3 years until she was finally forced to have her it euthanized.
 The young woman explained her unusual situation in an interview with WHAS-TV.
 Sarah Johnson says Kiki knew around twelves different sentences and would repeat them several hundred times every day.
 She says the constant harassment caused her to isolate herself socially and even suffer from a severe depression. She eventually dropped out of college, began drinking heavily and attempted twice to commit suicide.
 Steven More’s lawyer, Mr. Gary White described Ms. Johson’s complaint as “ridiculous”, saying his client could not be held responsible for her bird’s behavior for years after he stopped seeing it.
 This unusual as raised several questions concerning human legal responsibility in their pets’ behavior and also generated a lot of reactions on social media.
 A few readers feel sympathy for Ms. Johnson and support her claim that her ex-roommate should be held responsible for the harassment she suffered.
 However, a vast majority of comments seem to side with Mr. Moore and his lawyer, calling the lawsuit “pathetic”, “shameful” and “useless”.
 This case is expected to return in court next week for the beginning of the hearings.

", Man sues state of Alabama over document from 1865 giving him right to own “black slaves”," Hank Wyatt, 53, is suing the state of Alabama claiming the will of his great-great-grandfather, William Hugh Patton, has been illegally nullified by current state judges.
 Hank Wyatt recently came into possession of a document dating from 1865 previously owned by his great-great-grandfather, William Hugh Patton, which claims he legally bought four “negro” prisoners from the state of Alabama.
 The 153-year-old document signed by the Governor of Alabama at the time, Thomas H. Watts, boldly states that William Hugh Patton is given ownership over the aforementioned prisoners as well as to all of their descendants.
 Hank Wyatt’s attorney, Robert Lindsay, claims his client is entitled to a financial compensation since the document’s authenticity has been proven and complies with current federal laws.
 The Thirteen amendment to the United States Constitution declared slavery and involuntary servitude illegal in 1865, except as a punishment for criminality.
 This loophole, according to modern historians, was used to control, suppress and decimate communities of color, through mass arrests and imprisonment after the Civil War where black men’s free labor was used to help rebuild a ravaged South.
 OK, my great, great grandfather was a slave to his great, great, grandfather. so now what? I wish your salvage looking a** would try it. I will make you regret suing. Why do salvaged people like him think black people not gone f**k him up. Wake up dude, nobody’s going for it. This is not 1800’s.
 Alabama …I think its great hes keeping on the table…they cant hide anymore. Bring it up to the surface till its finally gone. All are created equal. The state of Alabama still dosent recognize that. Thank you sir for proving us what you call ‘race baiters’ correct. Racism and ignorance not only exist but are alive and well and coming out of the closet again.

 “I ain’t saying I want those people’s descendants to be my slaves. I just want a financial compensation, because legally, I own them,” Hank Wyatt told reporters.

 “My client’s demands clearly comply with current federal laws and the State of Alabama has the obligation of compensating my client for refusing to honor this contract,” attorney Robert Lindsay explained.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctor-gets-arm-stuck-for-8-hours-in-patients-anus-during-prostate-exam/
", Doctor gets arm stuck for 8 hours in patient’s anus during prostate exam," 51-year old Ronald Walters presented himself last week at the Orlando Regional Medical Center for a routine exam designed to detect prostate cancer.
 Unfortunately, the simple procedure rapidly took a dramatic twist when Dr. Bill H. Randall, who was performing the exam, got his right hand completely stuck in the patient’s rectum.
 The two men were stuck in this very uncomfortable position for several hours until a surgeon was called to perform an incision and free his colleague.
 Mr. Walters told MSNBC that he was immediately offered a financial compensation by the hospital, but preferred contacting lawyers to file a lawsuit.
 The 51-year old electrician says he intends to sue the hospital for more than $3 million once he recovers from his ordeal.
 The Orlando Regional Medical Center admitted that the doctor may have made a mistake during the procedure and announced that he would be suspended until the end of the investigation on the incident.
 The head of the medical staff at the Orlando Health Medical Center, Andrew Cheatham, met the media this morning to announce the temporary suspension of Dr. Randall and offer his sympathies to the patient.
 Prostate exams are extremely common medical procedures in most developed countries, and complications are extremely rare.
 Only one out of every 47,500 exams is reported to cause complications and most of these involve hemorrhoids or minor infections, often linked to insufficient sanitization.
 However, a few other incidents of negligence have been reported over the last few years, some leading to important financial compensations.
 In 2005, a Florida doctor lost a ring inside a patient’s rectum while performing a similar exam. A similar incident was reported in California in 2011 and lead to a $2.7M settlement.
 I fail to understand how DRE can cause such a havock . Interested to know the details.

 “They told me they were sorry about this ‘little incident’ and offered me 25,000$. That guy had his entire forearm in my ass for 8 hours, I think it’s worth more than that!”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/pregnant-teen-seeks-13-paternity-tests-after-gangbang-with-football-team/
", Pregnant teen seeks 13 paternity tests after gangbang with football team," Jessica H. Cockburn, 19, says she partook in consensual sex with at least 13 members of the team during a late-night party several weeks ago and has since then fallen pregnant.
 Cockburn admitted participating in the orgy willfully but now seeks to determine who is the father of the child-to-be.
 The young woman told the judge she had since reflected upon her actions and has greatly matured from the experience.
 A “lucky” member of the Ohio State Buckeyes football team could be the unexpected father of the child conceived during a late-night party which turned into an orgy several weeks ago.
 Judge Martin Andrews has ordered that several members of the Ohio State Buckeyes football college team pass paternity tests after Jessica H. Cockburn, 19, allegedly had sex with at least thirteen of them.
 Cockburn’s lawyer made a list of thirteen names with pictures of the players of the college football team found on the team’s internet website and that his client specifically remembered having sexual intercourse with that night.
 Judge Andrews said that even though the mother-to-be’s judgment had “failed her that night” and that her actions were “extremely irresponsible,” that her future child did have the right to know the identity of his biological father and agreed to order the paternity tests.
 An Ohio State Buckeyes spokesman would not comment upon the allegations and said the university did not regulate the players’ activities outside of official games and practice time.
 Can I get this babes address pleez. I would love to bang her also.

 “I didn’t check if they were all wearing protection, it slipped from my attention,” she told Judge Andrews.

 “I am not the same person I was before. I’ve learned my lesson and believe I have what it takes to be a mom,” she said in court.

 Other individuals she had sex with that night she could not find any information about and could have been acquaintances of the players or Ohio State University employees she conceded.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/man-sues-his-mother-for-breastfeeding-him-until-age-12/
", Man sues his mother for breastfeeding him until age 12," The plaintive, Robert Miller from Dyersburg, claims that his mother’s overly protective behavior during his childhood and the fact that she breastfed him until age 12 have permanently affected his ability to develop relationships with women.
 Mr. Miller is demanding $250,000 of compensation for the “psychological trauma” he has suffered and is also asking for $100,000 of punitive damage to be imposed on his 69-year old mother, Dorothy Jenson Miller.
 According to his lawyer, Thomas McHenry, the 37-year old man’s life was completely ruined by his mother’s obnoxious behavior.
 Mr. McHenrry insists that his client’s demands are “more than reasonable” considering the gravity of the trauma he suffered.
 The defendant, Ms. Jenson Miller, admits that she “may have been overprotective” but claims that she “never had any intention to cause him any harm”.
 Mr. Miller’s mother refused to meet with the press to discuss the lawsuit and even ousted a Fox reporter who showed up at her door.
 This controversial lawsuit hasn’t even begun, but it’s already generating a lot of reactions on the various social media.
 While many people are showing some sympathy towards the 69-year old defendant, most of them note that her parental behavior seemed “rather disturbing”.
 Legal experts are divided in their analysis of the case. Most admit that the mother’s behavior as “clearly caused the victim some psychological and relational problems”, there is no sign of “intentional mistreatment” on her part.
 Both parties are expected the be back in court in December for the beginning of the hearings.
 Wait until these children being raised without a gender grow up! They will all be suing their parents as well.

  “My client’s mother dressed him up as a girl until he was five years old and breastfed him until he was twelve. These disturbing behaviors have profoundly traumatized him, and have already cost him more than $120,000 in therapy.”

", Texas: 14-Year Old Virgin Falls Pregnant After Flu Shot," After symptoms persisted several weeks, the distressed mother brought her child to the
   Whole Woman’s Health of Forth Worth
  medical clinic where she was found to be pregnant moments later.
 “She was in excellent health beforehand. After a few days she became very unwell, she had all the symptoms of a fever” explains her mother.
 “It took a good few weeks before she felt better, but the nausea continued. She would throw up every day or so until eventually, we went to see Dr. Hersch who realized she was pregnant” she told local reporters, visibly still under shock.
 Dr. Catherine Hersch was skeptical at first but further investigation led her to corroborate the family’s verdict
 The young girl told Dr. Hersch she had never participated in sexual intercourse and swore that her hymen was still intact, which was later confirmed by the doctor.
 “She had all the typical symptoms of a pregnant woman. It’s not the first time a young woman falls pregnant without the consent of her parents, but the girl seemed sincere when she said she had never had sexual relations with a boy, and she urged me to check her hymen, which I eventually did, and to my utter surprise, the hymen was fully intact. It is impossible she has been impregnated by male sperm” she assures.
 The young girl and her family have decided to keep the baby regardless of the atypical situation.
 “We are devout Christians. If God made this birth possible, then who are we to judge the how or the why?” she ponders.
 “If Joseph and Mary had not given birth to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, where would humanity be today?” she asks, a tear in her eyes.
 “We will soon have a new family member within our community, and it is a gift and a blessing”.
 “Vaccine technology is fairly recent in history so we hypothesize how they work, but as in this instance, why do some women fall pregnant from vaccines?” asks Ph.D. student Alexa Goldberg,  who is writing her doctoral thesis on the subject.
 “There is clearly a necessity to study this growing trend and further research is needed. The scientific community must stop avoiding this highly controversial subject. If nothing is done, this tragic situation will only repeat itself in the future” she warns.
 A moratorium was put on HPV vaccines for six months after Mexican health authorities claimed the “contaminated batch” was the root cause of the problem.
  The United Nations estimates over 4,000 people each year fall pregnant to vaccine shots, but a 2012 World Health Organization (WHO) report concludes the benefits of mass vaccination campaigns worldwide are well worth the risk.
 The medical clinic where the inoculation took place firmly denies any wrongdoing on their part and claims the accusations are “absurd and improbable”.

 “In my 26 years of practice, I have never heard once of such a thing as someone being impregnated by a vaccine, but I did some research and found out it is more common than most people think”.

 A similar case occurred in 2013 when 11 young girls in Mexico, near the city of Juarez in the state of Veracruz, aged 11 to 17, claimed they had fallen pregnant after being given HPV shots.

", Greenpeace activist gets arm bitten off after hugging a white shark," 21-year old Darrell Waterford, from Eugene in Oregon, was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace, some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth.
 Along with four other members of the organization, Mr. Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predator’s public image and raise awareness about shark hunting.
 The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals.
 Unfortunately for the young American, one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him.
 It attacked Mr. Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow. The young man lost a large amount of blood, but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital.
 Huei Li Chong, the leader of the expedition, described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
 According to him, the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water.
 Huei Li Chong, who was diving with Mr. Waterford at the time of the attack, believes the shark may have become aggressive after smelling blood.
 Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning, which consists of the removal of fins from sharks, often while the shark is alive.
 Despite the organization’s efforts, finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures.
 Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white shark’s image in order to obtain an international ban, similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling.
 Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white shark’s image as a peaceful marine creature.
 It seems Darwin was robbed.

  “The shark seemed really friendly at first, but then it went totally berserk. It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant, so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us.”
 

 
  “Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when they’re calm, but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts. It’s not their fault, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible.”

", Canadian fisherman survives sexual assault by dozens of seals," The man that was violently thrown off the commercial fishing boat during a heavy storm was lost at sea and believed to be dead by Canadian Coast Guard officials.
 Pete McAllister eventually found his way onto a rock island populated by seagulls and dozens of seals.
 “I was burnt out, freezing cold and dehydrated. I saw the seals showing signs of aggression, so I played dead,” the fisherman recalls.
 He then describes how dozens of seals tried to mate with him, apparently mistaking him for a female seal.
 “My girlfriend keeps saying I was gang banged by a bunch of seals. I ain’t no Christian but that is my definition of Hell” he told reporters laughingly, amidst the tragic events.
 Hellen Feller, a biologist at the University of Victoria, believes McAllister was saved from hypothermia and kept his body temperature warm because of the mating habits of the seals.
 According to biologist Hellen Feller, McAllister’s survival might be linked to the elephant seal’s mating habits.
 “May to August is the elephant seal’s breeding season and males are extremely sexually active and can become highly aggressive during this period” explains Hellen Feller, a biologist at the University of Victoria.
 “So in a way, it is a good thing he was there during their breeding period,” she added, slightly amused.
 Luckily enough, Pete McAllister was eventually rescued by a Canadian Coast Guard Search and Rescue patrol approximately 24 hours later.
 He was found unharmed and is not likely to suffer from any permanent frostbite injury believe doctors.

  “I felt their heavy weight on my back as I was pretending to be dead. I can still hear those awful grunts and remember the pounding, I was sure I was going to die” he recalls, visibly grateful to be alive.

", Ohio: Naked man on crystal meth bites 28 people in a Walmart Store," 29-year-old Michael Kruger entered the store naked and visibly intoxicated around 9:30 AM this morning.
 He immediately began running around the supercenter, jumping on some of the customers and savagely biting them.
 Ruth Davis, an employee who witnessed the attack, says the aggressor looked like he was possessed or infected with rabies.
 The Walmart employee says that Mr. Kruger kept making strange sounds and saying incoherent things.
 Mr. Kruger bit a total of 28 people and lightly assaulted a dozen others before he was finally arrested by the Cleveland Police.
 None of the victims were severely injured, but there is a slight risk that they may have contracted some disease from their aggressor.
 Ruth Davis and her colleagues say they see many strange and funny things at work, but this was one of the oddest they have ever seen.
 Michael Kruger told investigators that he spent the entire night smoking crystal meth and had decided to walk to the Walmart to get some food.
 He explained that he had taken off his clothes on the way to “get rid of the spying equipment the Vatican had planted” on him and was biting people to “make sure they’re not terminators” sent to kill him.
 Mr. Kruger’s lawyer demanded that he undergo a psychiatric evaluation before the beginning of his trial.
 He faces a total of 47 criminal charges and a maximum of 240 years in prison.
 The non conceal and carry law is what saved this man.
 This is a perfect example of when concealed carry would have stopped this immediately. What a nutcase.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/teenager-accidentally-chops-off-his-genitals-during-sex-with-a-blender/
", Teenager accidentally chops off his genitals during sex with a blender," 16-year old Brian Johnson was apparently alone in his parents’ house and decided to engage in sexual intercourse with various objects around the residence.
 He admitted to having sex with a toaster, a vacuum cleaner, and an old video recorder, as well as a dozen other items.
 This strange sexual orgy could have continued for hours, but it was suddenly interrupted by a terrible accident.
 The young man had his genitals inside the electric blender and he accidentally hit one of the appliance’s button, activating it.
 He was instantly emasculated by the rotating blade and his genitals were reduced to shreds in a matter of seconds.
 The young man was severely bleeding and he barely managed to call 911 before he lost consciousness. Fortunately for him, paramedics arrived on the site in a matter of minutes and he was rapidly transported to the hospital.
 According to Jeremy Morane, one of the paramedics who transported the teenager, the quantity of blood on the scene was a testimony to the violence of the accident.
 Mr. Morane claims the young man lost more than five pints of blood and is extremely lucky to be alive.
 Fortunately for him, Brian Johnson was transported to the Citizens Memorial Hospital just in time, and doctors were able to stabilize him.
 The paramedics Jeremy Morane and Jason Norris probably saved the young man’s life with their rapid intervention. The governor’s office has announced that the two heroes will be nominated for the Missouri Medal of Honor for their actions.
 Mr. Johnson’s terrible emasculation may seem unusual, but accidents of sexual nature involving everyday items are actually pretty common in the United States.
 An average of 71 Americans dies every year while having sex with various inanimate objects and more than 4000 others have to be hospitalized.
 The items most commonly implicated are shower heads,  TV remote controls, toilet brushes and vacuum cleaners.
 Incidents involving blenders are rather rare, however, and the most recent occurred in 2007 when a 47-year man from Illinois died under similar circumstances.
 he was never goning to score with those eyes anyway.
 I’m sorry but how does a man have sex with a blender? Or any of the other items mentioned?
 This kid should just kill himself now, he has no reason to live.

", Borneo: Irish Tourist Savagely Raped by 400-Pound Orangutan," Zack O’Reilly, a young 26-year-old from Ireland, who is presently studying biology at Dublin City University and has been a Greenpeace activist for the past three years, had always dreamed of seeing orangutans in their natural habitat and was a strong advocate against the palm oil industry, which is a great threat to the endangered species.
 – Kelly O’Reilly, mother
 The young man was quickly brought back to a missionary hospital near Kalimantan where he lay unconscious for many hours and where doctors found traces of internal bleeding.
 Kelly O’Reilly, the victim’s mother, says she used to tease him, telling her son he looked like a orangutan, but she never suspected he would be sexually assaulted by one, she told reporters in tears
 Kekbek Mahlouiak, one of the tour guides present on the dramatic trip, says he has warned various tourists to be careful around the animals.
 “I specifically told him to wear a hat and hide his orange hair, that it could entice the orangutans. I’m not surprised of what has happened, I warned him many times. He did not listen,” he told local reporters.
 “It is very dangerous for people with orange hair, the males get very excited. A male followed us deep into the jungle many kilometers, he was very aggressive. There is nothing I could do,” he added.
 A spokeswoman for the Borneo Tourism Board said it is the first time an orangutan has physically assaulted a tourist on one of their jungle treks.
 “We are deeply horrified and saddened by the whole affair. We have offered the young victim a free tour if he ever wishes to come back again and will provide increased security for our travelers in the future,” she added.
 A similar incident was previously reported in a Jakarta zoo in 2014, when a young red-haired woman was hospitalized after an orangutan broke out of its cage and tried to mate with the visitor, resulting in the death of the animal by zoo employees.
 Lol, I am seriously LMAO!!! An idiot greenpeace activist liberal….who guess what…doesn’t listen to others regarding common sense!! And the mother’s words “I used to tease him, saying he looked like one and that he’d find his soulmate in the jungle….” Oh man, you just can’t make this stuff up. She’s right though…he does look like one. All liberals are part of the primate species.

", Florida: 400-Pound Woman Survives Sexual Assault by herd of Manatees," The tourist on vacation went for a swim near 2 pm in the afternoon when she was suddenly caught up by a herd of male manatees that possibly mistook the poor woman for a female manatee.
 “I was just playing around in the water when I suddenly noticed a herd of manatees next to me. At first, I was curious, but eventually I became scared when they started getting agitated” she recalls, visibly traumatized by the latest events.
 “It all happened in a flash, all I remember is the horrifying sight of the manatees trying to grab me and force me into submission. Luckily, a man on a jet ski caught their attention and scared them away moments before the Coast Guard rescued me,” she told local reporters.
 A herd of male manatees possibly mistook the vacationer for a female manatee, a rare phenomenon as manatees are usually shy creatures
 The sexual assault of the herd of manatees on a human being could be explained by the menstrual cycle of the vacationer, believes Jane Keller, professor of biology at the University of South Florida.
 “
  When a female manatee goes into estrus, she is soon detected and pursued by numerous male manatees throughout the cycle. During that time, the female can mate with a dozen or more males in what is known as an estrus or mating herd. It is possible that the animals mistook the bloody vaginal discharge of the victim’s period as a female manatee in estrus,” she explains.
  “I would definitely suggest that women not go swimming during their menstrual cycle in areas where manatee mating occurs,” she warns.
 Tyler Smith, a 17-year-old lifeguard present during the sexual assault, believes she is lucky to be alive.
  “We often see manatees nearby but it’s the first time they attack someone,” he admits.
  “There were so many manatees around her, I think I counted at least 10 of them. They were all fighting against each other to get on her back and hump her, it was like a big manatee gangbang. She is definitely lucky to be alive” he acknowledges, visibly distraught by the whole affair.
 Although experts claim this is an unprecedented and isolated incident, increased security measures will be taken to prevent further occurrences of such tragic incidents, say local authorities.
 How many in the world has that happen to because it’s the first I ever heard of it
 At least she’s not Brett Keane
 I’m sorry but this is downright hilarious. Being so fat that MALE manatees mistake you for a female of their kind, at that point she knows she’s screwed up. Should have just enjoyed it, that was a only chance of an orgy she was ever going to get LMAO.
 I’m sorry too but yeah it had nothing to do with menstral cycle lol they were just sugercoating it cus they didnt wanna fat shame her but I think we all know that the reason that happened and not everyone else that swims with them was because she did not look like a human to them cus that’s not normally how they look to be that big is an abnormality. They mistook her for a manitee because to them she looked like one. But yeah lol it was all cus of the “menstral cycle” we will just say that haha.

They claimed to have found the man while he was lying unconscious on the banks of the Tangshui River.
 He finally woke up almost 16 hours after arriving at the hospital, but couldn’t remember his name or how he arrived in Taipei.
 He was rapidly identified, however, thanks to his fingerprints, instantly attracting a lot of attention from the media and from various Asian governments.
 The doctors who have been treating since his arrival believe that he may be suffering from regressive amnesia, caused by a major stress or life-threatening situation.
 Dr. Sulong says that it is impossible to say how long it will take before his patient is able to regain his memory, but he is convinced that over time, he should be able to overcome his amnesia.
 Many people hope that Captain Shah will now be able to bring answers concerning Malaysia Airlines ‘s Boeing 777-200ER, that disappeared on 8 March 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
 Despite all the efforts of the international community, the faith of the infamous flight remains unclear, almost 2 years after the events.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/flat-earth-theorist-disappears-while-sailing-to-the-end-of-the-world/
", Flat Earth theorist disappears while sailing to the “End of the World”," An international rescue mission has been launched this morning in order to Irvin Walters, a retired trucker and notorious member of the Flat Earth Movement.
 Mr. Walters was last seen in the Australian port of Sydney on November 27, before he sailed South towards Antartica.
 Adepts of the Flat Earth theory believe that our planet isn’t spherical. They think our world is, in fact, disk-shaped and surrounded by Antartica.
 Being convinced that Antarctica is only a thin ice wall surrounding a disk-shaped Earth, he hoped to cross it and take pictures at the end of the disk.
 Mr. Walters was reported missing by his family in California after he missed his last two radio conferences with them.
 Since he left the United States in June, he would communicate every three days with his family using a satellite radio, but he hasn’t called for the last eight days.
 Australian authorities have taken the American man’s disappearance very seriously and asked neighboring countries for help in finding him.
 A spokesman of the Australian Coast Guard says they fear he may have gotten lost or even capsized, and could rapidly die of hypothermia.
 They believe his ship has traveled at least 400 nautical miles south of Australia before it encountered problems, but they have very little information concerning his actual position.
 The United States, New Zealand, the Philippines and Indonesia have also sent ships and helicopters to help in the search and rescue mission, allocating a total of 13 ships and 7 helicopters.
 Despite all the resources allocated to saving him, many experts say it would be a miracle if he was found alive.
 Mr. Walters has spent the last few months sailing the Pacific and the Indian Ocean aboard a small, specially designed boat, hoping to travel from California to Antartica.
 Mr. Walters has been for many years, a militant member of the Flat Earth Movement.
 In an interview with the site FlatEarth.com recorded in May, he said he had spent more than three years preparing for his trip.
 He said he hoped to gather some irrefutable scientific proof that the Earth is flat, like “pictures of the disk’s end”.
 He claimed to come from a family with a long naval tradition and described himself as a “7th generation sailor”, yet he admitted that he had never sailed before.
 Several analysts have speculated that this lack of sailing experience could have been a serious problem in treacherous waters south of Tasmania.

", Taiwanese millionaire successfully gets transplanted 12-inch-long black man’s penis," Huy Xen Phang, a Taiwanese businessman who made his fortune in the real estate industry, had been waiting for 18 months before a suitable donor was found.
 The penis transplantation is not only the fourth such surgery performed in the world but also the biggest known to date because of the enormous size of the penis in question.
 “I am very proud of my big new penis, I don’t care if people know about it, it will only make them jealous,” Phang told reporters hours after the operation.
  “My penis was very, very small, like most Asian people. Now I will have biggest black dick in all of Taiwan and China,” he added with pride.
 Dr. Andre van der Merwe of the Tygerberg Hospital (middle) admits he is very proud of the successful transplant but that it took a long time to find a suitable donor.
 Dr. Andre van der Merwe of the Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, admits it took 18 months until a suitable donor was found.
 “Usually we do transplants from dead bodies to living bodies but in this case, the donor is still alive,” he told the Cape Town Herald.
 “We ran ads in national newspapers and finally found a number of suitable matches for Mr. Phang with whom he arranged a financial agreement,” he added.
 Dr. Andre van der Merwe also warns that the procedure is expensive and not for everyone.
 “There are many risks involved, such as rejection of the organ by the body or surgical complications,” he admits.
 “There is also a period of adaptation, most people are not used to carrying such a heavy load,” he laughs.
 This is not the first transracial penis transplant as the same team of surgeons from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Tygerberg Hospital successfully transplanted a white penis on a black man who had lost his penis during a botched circumcision 17 years earlier.

 “My wife always tease me about my tiny penis, now she will have big black cock,” he said laughingly.

 “Mr. Phang was very specific the penis needed to be over 12 inches long, not an inch shorter,” he explained.

 
  “It is also recommended with a penis of this size to be careful during the first erections. One might become light-headed or even lose consciousness because of the blood transfer from the brain to the groin,” he adds.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/cosmetic-lab-employee-admits-he-ejaculated-in-tanks-of-face-cream/
", Cosmetic lab employee admits he ejaculated in tanks of face cream," 59-year old Larry Gordon was arrested this morning by officers of Detroit Police Department after he was caught on tape and confessed his actions to his employer.
 Mr. Gordon spent the last seven years working as a night watch at a lab owned by American Cosmetic Chemicals (ACC), a subcontractor for several companies including Cover Girl, Neutrogena, and Yves Rocher.
 He was recently caught by a video camera while masturbating in the cream tanks and was confronted by his employer.
 Faced with the gravity of his confession, the board of directors of the ACC immediately decided to suspend Mr. Gordon from his job and contact the police.
 The DPD led a rapid investigation and arrested Larry Gordon this morning under five charges of sexual assault, and some police sources say that many more charges could be filed over the next few days.
 Detroit police chief James Craig says the investigators take this case very seriously and that Mr. Gordon’s victims could number in the millions.
 It remains unclear at the moment which brands or products were contaminated by Mr. Gordon’s sperm, but an ACC spokesman tried to reassure the public by stating that the semen was only present in small quantities and represented no health hazard.
 The company says an investigation is underway to determine exactly which products were affected, but it admitted that between 500,000 and 3,000,000 customers may have bought contaminated cosmetics.
 Mr. Gordon’s lawyer, Ben Tillerman, says his client suffers from serious mental problems and has demanded a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he is fit to stand a trial.
 The evaluation will take place as soon as the police investigation is completed and should take a few days, which means Mr. Gordon should make his first appearance in court next week.
 Probably the best ingredient in the cream.. haha
 Another Great Example of WHY men are completely USELESS and SELFISH and a Health Hazard.. like their parents told them to do that whenenver and wherever they liked; because no one else mattered..
 I was wondering why my face was so much smoother and wrinkle-free…must have been the protein! lol
 Wtfuck! Lorraine Bobbit? Paging Lorraine Bobbit. Please report to the Detroit Police Department. Your experience in dickectomy is needed. Bring a dull blade.

", 14-year old student builds an Atomic bomb as a science project," 14-year old Kathryn Simmons is one of the 137 students who were participating this week, in this year’s New Hampshire State Junior Science Fair.
 Daughter of a Marine Captain and an aeronautic engineer, she decided to present a complete A-bomb as her project in order to “show people that these things aren’t so dangerous”.
 She says building a bomb is hardly more complicated and dangerous than building a dishwasher.
 She hopes that her bomb will show people that atomic bombs are “simple machines like any others” and help the public be less afraid of nuclear weapons.
 Kathryn’s science teacher, Ronald Terrence, says he’s impressed by what she was able to accomplish with the materials that she found at the hardware store.
 Despite numerous critics from parents and teachers alike, Kathryn Simmons’ project earned the first place in the New Hampshire State Science Fair.
 Her A-bomb will now be presented during the National Junior Science Fair, which will be held in Denver, in January.
 A few organizations, including Greenpeace, have announced their intentions to disturb the event if her “weapon” is exhibited.
 Despite these threats, Kathryn says she’s determined to “be in Denver and win.”
 This isn’t the first time that a controversial school project stirs a controversy in the United States.
 In 2011, a 15-year old student from Alabama was expelled from school after projecting to clone himself.
 “Functional” is probably not the best term here. It obviously does not contain the the weapons grade plutonium required. Of course if she has a pen pal in Iran and and a contact in the Clinton Foundation, it shouldn’t be to difficult to obtain. Greenpeace doesn’t seem to mind nuclear proliferation as long as the country is not an ally of the U.S. You go girl!

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/drunk-employee-arrested-at-cern-after-causing-3-2-magnitude-earthquake/
", Drunk Employee Arrested at CERN After Causing 3.2 Magnitude Earthquake," Russian physicist Alexandreï Ziouganov has been accused of “breaking CERN security rules” by “attempting highly risky and dangerous maneuvers” after he urged technicians to push the giant 27 km long particle accelerator to its limits, avoiding potential warning signs given by his coworkers while intoxicated by alcohol and under heavy medication.
 The operation is believed to have caused an earthquake of 3.2 magnitude on the Richter scale, comparable to the impact of a large lightning bolt, assess experts.
 Under the supervision of the physicist, the LHC successfully collided two proton beams with 7.5 TeV of energy per proton, resulting in a record-breaking 13 TeV collision which is believed to have caused a 3.2 magnitude earthquake in the region
 The Russian physicist known for his bold character has been an outspoken CERN critic since he joined the team of international scientists nearly 5 years ago.
 “He is a man of extremes” explains his coworker, Romanian physicist Yuri Malania. “He is possibly one of the 100 most brilliant minds in the world, but his character is like that of an erupting volcano. He wants everything to go faster, he strongly believes we are decades backward in science. He wishes humanity would already be colonizing Mars and the Moon, he wishes to leave his mark and push the limits of science into the 21st century,” he adds.
 In a 2013 interview with Russian science magazine
  атомный
 , the physicist known for his
  o
  utsp
  okenness
 said that CERN scientists “were a bunch of wimps”, “incapable of understanding the importance of this technology” and that “they would never understand his genius”.
 The controversial physicist is also known for his obsession with dark matter and black holes.
 “His dream is clearly to recreate a black hole within the LHC” explains French science journalist, Jeanne Legrand.
 “He has always been a strong supporter within the European scientific community of increasing the capacities of the LHC and is at the origin of the highly controversial proposition of the LHCx, a process which would accelerate particles at speeds a thousand times faster, although most scientists do not approve of such tests for the moment,” she explains.
 Last year his controversial views and statements on the LHC provoked a wave of hysteria after
  Pope Francis
 warned such tests could “have disastrous consequences for humanity” and could “open the gates of Hell”.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/pyramids-were-built-with-help-from-dinosaurs-claims-top-egyptologist/
"," Pyramids Were Built With Help From Dinosaurs, Claims Top Egyptologist"," Astonishingly, the papyri were written by men who participated in the building of the Great Pyramid, the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu, and mention the use of “beastly creatures” of “enormous size” according to Professor Al-Sammud.
 The outlandish claim would have been rapidly dismissed if it did not come from one of Egyptology’s most eminent figures and has definitely come as a surprise to the scientific community.
 The Narmer Palette, also known as the Great Hierakonpolis Palette or the Palette of Narmer, is a significant Egyptian archeological find, dating from about the 31st century BC, containing some of the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions ever found and also believed by some to depict living dinosaurs.
 Surprisingly, the discovery of the ancient papyri and 26 stone cosmetic palettes bearing carved decoration and hieroglyphic writings was made in a nearby cave only a few kilometers outside modern Cairo.
 The team of researchers believe that the caves had served as a kind of boat storage depot during the fourth dynasty of the Old Kingdom, about 4,600 years ago.
 “We unearthed entire rolls of papyrus, some a few feet long and still relatively intact, written in hieroglyphics as well as hieratic, the cursive script the ancient Egyptians used for everyday communication,” explains phD student Fatima Al-Faya.
 The papyri also mention “the noble Ankh-haf,” who was known to be the half-brother of the Pharaoh Khufu and is described as overseeing some of the construction of the Great Pyramid.
 The most surprising portions of the ancient texts and stone palettes are concerning Ra Nt-Ka, translated as “God beast” which was presumably tamed and used to carry the large limestone blocks that compose the pyramids.
 “For centuries it was presumed that Ra Nt-Ka was possibly a whale, but here we have descriptions of Ra Nt-Ka delving in water as well as on land, and the papyri mention that the animal “of great stature” was used to carry materials used during the construction of the pyramids,” explains Prof Al-Sammud, visibly exhilarated.
 “They are described as tamed beasts of burden who “eat of the Niles grass”, whose tail when lashed “can kill an army of men” and “whose necks reach out to the sky”, which lets us believe the creature could depict a species of brontosaurus of some kind” he adds.
 This incredible discovery occurs  decades after paleontologists have unearthed the first fossils of a colossal new species of dinosaur in Egypt, one of the heaviest creatures to have walked the Earth.
 Its name, Paralititan, means tidal giant. The long-necked, long-tailed vegetarian could have straddled a modern African elephant, say experts.
 “We can’t speculate if this is the species of dinosaur that may have lived amongst ancient Egyptians but fossil remains are fairly prevalent in the Nile region and these amphibious beasts were definitely common in the area at one time” explains fellow Egyptologist, Helmut Ferrlug of the University of Berlin.
 One recent skeleton finding in 2014 proved to be a new species of Titanosaurus, a group of long-necked, long-tailed, plant-eating dinosaurs that includes some of the largest animals ever. The period in which Paralititan lived is still a mystery to paleontologists.
 Interesting. Especially if provible. I don’t care if it’s not part of someone’s science ideology, I’ve seen enough wierd instances that I am willing not to close the door to this possibility.
 Das ist alles ein kompletter Unsinn
 There are also hieroglyphics of humans with the heads of goats! Unlikely there were dinosaurs among the Egyptians, more likely there were ample Hallucinogens, such as poppies! TESD!

 I understand our present view of human history is completely different from what we are proposing, but based on these ancient papyri we must consider the possibility that dinosaurs may have lived amongst ancient Egyptians and were possibly tamed to carry the huge blocks that compose the pyramids

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/antarctica-nasa-images-reveal-traces-of-ancient-human-settlement-underneath-2-3-km-of-ice/
", Antarctica: NASA Images Reveal Traces of Ancient Human Settlement Underneath 2.3 km of Ice,"  The intriguing discovery was made during aircraft tests trials of NASA’s Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) lidar technology set to be launched on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) in 2017, that aims to monitor changes in polar ice.
  “There’s very little margin for error when it comes to individual photons hitting on individual fiber optics, that is why we were so surprised when we noticed these abnormal features on the lidar imagery,” explains Nathan Borrowitz, IceBridge’s project scientist and sea ice researcher with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
 Although NASA scientist Nathan Borrowitz claims the infrared images are definitely intriguing, other experts claim they are clearly the proof of ancient human engineering
  Leading archeologist, Ashoka Tripathi, of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Calcutta believes the images show clear evidence of an ancient human settlement beneath the ice sheet.
  “These are clearly features of some sort of human-made structure, resembling some sort of pyramidal structure. The patterns clearly show nothing we should expect from natural geomorphological formations found in nature. We clearly have here evidence of human engineering. The only problem is that these photographs were taken in Antarctica under 2 kilometers of ice. That is clearly the puzzling part, we do not have any explanation for this at the moment,” he admits.
  “These pictures just reflect a small portion of Antarctica’s total land mass. There are possibly many other additional sites that are covered over with ice. It just shows us how easy it is to underestimate both the size and scale of past human settlements,” says Dr. Tripathi.
  Historian and cartographer at the University of Cambridge, Christopher Adam, believes there might be a rational explanation.
 The map of Turkish admiral Piri Reis in 1513 AD shows the “ice less” coastline of Antarctica
  “One of history’s most puzzling maps is that of the Turkish admiral Piri Reis in 1513 AD which successfully mapped the coastline of Antarctica over 500 years ago. What is most fascinating about this map is that it shows the coastline of Antarctica without any ice. How is this possible when images of the subglacial coastline of Antarctica were only seen for the first time after the development of ground-penetrating radar in 1958? Is it possible Antarctica has not always been covered under such an ice sheet? This could be evidence that it is a possibility” he acknowledges.
  « A slight pole shift or displacement of the axis of rotation of the Earth in historical times is possibly the only rational explanation that comes to mind but we definitely need more research done before we jump to any conclusion.”
  ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2), part of NASA’s Earth Observing System, is a planned satellite mission for measuring ice sheet mass elevation, sea ice freeboard as well as land topography and vegetation characteristics, and is set to launch in may 2017.
 The Reis Map was ‘composed’ of several much older ‘ancient’ maps that appear to be centered over Cario Egypt. One of the ‘older maps’ showing the coast of the New World was in the ossession of Columbus when he convinced the Queen of Spain to finance his trip. Several American Native groups trace their migration North from Antarctica. DNA traces conform their legends.
 The Reis map was admitted to be made using ancient maps of Antarctica which had been drawn complete with navigational lines (latitude/longitude). These maps even showed a mountain range that wasn’t “rediscovered” until 1952. Intriguing!

 “As of now we can only speculate as to what these features are but the launching of ICESat-2 in 2017 could lead to other major discoveries and a better understanding of Antarctica’s geomorphological features” he adds.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/5-meter-tall-human-skeleton-unearthed-in-australia/
", 5-Meter Tall Human Skeleton Unearthed in Australia," The gigantic hominid specimen that measures an incredible 5.3 meters tall (17 foot and 4 inches) was discovered near the ancient ruins of the only megalithic civilization ever discovered in Australia, which makes the discovery twice as puzzling admits professor Hans Zimmer of the University of Adelaide.
 “The discovery of the Uluru archeological site last year already took us by surprise, but this new find is just jaw-dropping” he admits, visibly dumbfounded.
 “Theoretically, a five-meter-tall hominid cannot exist. How did this occur? How is this possible. Although this discovery is fascinating, we are left with more questions than answers” he concedes.
 The discovery of a 5-meter tall human skeleton near Ayers rock is the largest skeleton ever found and leaves scientists with “more questions than answers” concedes Hans Zimmer, professor of Archeology at the University of Adelaide
 Some experts have hypothesized that the specimen might have suffered from an extreme case of gigantism, a
  condition caused by the over-production of
 growth hormones, a theory professor Hans Zimmer dismisses as “pure speculation”.
 “Only further research can help us uncover the truth behind this anomaly of nature. Until we have found more skeletal remains, we should not rush ourselves into hazardous explanations” he told local reporters.
 “We have found several incomplete skeletons, of which the bones were also of gigantic size. It seems a major catastrophe has completely washed away all traces of this lost and unknown civilization” he notes.
 “This specimen is apparently not unique, it is but a question of time before we find a similar specimen” he firmly believes.
 The Uluru archeological site, unearthed in 2014 by a team of researchers from the Australian National University, led to the discovery of a previously unknown megalithic civilization that could help solve the mystery of the estranged discovery.
 “We have unearthed last February a megalithic block that is estimated to weight an approximate 80 tons.
 The basalt qualities of the monolith are found only 200 km away.
 How did they move this huge block hundreds of kilometers into the desert, what technologies did this civilization use? We cannot properly answer these questions at the present moment” admits John Thomas Buckler, head archeologist during the 2014 excavation.
 Some specialists believe a major catastrophe is the cause of the destruction of the Uluru civilization, turning the whole region from a rich fertile land into a sterile desert at the time
 “Ferrous deposits are found all over the Australian desert, which possibly proves some sort of meteorite impact in the region” explains Sydney-based researcher, Allan DeGroot.
 “The analysis of geological deposits confirm a large impact in the region between 3,500 and 2,500 years ago” admits the leading expert.
 “The catastrophic destruction revealed by traces of vitrification and high levels of radiation at the ruins of the Uluru archeological site clearly lead us to believe both events are intimately linked together” he concludes.
 The radioactive qualities of the skeleton remains have made the scientists work extremely complicated, but Hans Zimmer’s team hopes international cooperation with other major universities could help solve the enigma of the giant remains much sooner by giving the team access to technologies that are not available in Australia for the moment.
 Hosea 4:6 6My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being My priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.
 ***God has told us about all these things but man wants to reject God so they are at a loss to explain these very things that God has reveled to man..
 The bible speaks of giants giant people they were wicked in there ways and GOD destroyed his creation
 read the book of enoch
 The Bible predicted that Babylon ( Iraq ) will be destroyed thousands of years ago. and it is getting destroyed. The Bible says that Damascus will cease to exist and it is getting fulfilled right before our eyes. The Bible is more complex and advanced than all the science in the world.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/archaeologists-discover-golden-plates-believed-to-be-linked-to-joseph-smith-jr/
", Archaeologists Discover Golden Plates Believed to Be Linked to Joseph Smith Jr.," The scientists, led by Professor Abraham Jones, are associated with the Brigham Young University’s faculty of archaeology.
 They were using advanced metal detectors, lasers and other ground-penetrating imaging technology to look for underground structures when they noticed a small cave-like cavity.
 They dug up the entrance, which was buried under a dozen feet of rocks and dirt, and explored the very exiguous cavern.
 The walls and ceiling were covered with ancient traces of soot, presumably from torches, suggesting the cave had been visited many times in the past.
 On top of a large flat stone resembling an altar, they found what looks like a book made of metal plates.
 The scientists explored the mysterious cavern, but have not been able to recover any other artifact. They have found, however, a few signs of human activity like the ashes of two ancient campfires.
 The “book” is made of a set of twelve metal plates, each measuring six inches (15 cm) in width, eight inches (20 cm) in length approximately half an inch (1.27 centimeter) in thickness.
 The plates are made of a copper-gold alloy and are held together by three D-shaped rings, forming a sort of book.  The entire volume measures a total of nearly six inches [15 cm] in thickness and weights 59 pounds (26.76 kg).
 The plates are covered with mysterious symbols, very similar to the  “reformed Egyptian” characters, written by Joseph Smith Jr. on the document known as the “Anthon Transcript”.
 Many of the symbols on the plates found by the archaeologists are identical to those drawn by the prophet, in 1928.
 LDS scholars have hypothesized that the reformed Egyptian writing could have developed from other modified Egyptian scripts such as
  hieratic
 , a priestly shorthand for hieroglyphics.
 Joseph Smith Jr. is said to have found similar golden plates on September 22, 1823, in a hill near his home in Manchester, New York.
 He claimed that an angel named Moroni had directed him to a buried stone box, containing a set of gold plates, covered with strange symbols.
 Smith translated the text of the Book of Mormon over the next several years by using a seer stone, which he placed in the bottom of a hat and then placed the hat over his face to view the words written within the stone.
 He finally published the book in 1830, which was meant to be a complement to the Bible.
 This new discovery could be the most important material and historical proof ever found, to back the claims of Joseph Smith Jr.
 Professor Jones and the scientists from Brigham Young University will now perform an extensive series of tests and analysis to determine if the plates could indeed be linked to the prophet.
 Perhaps this was the prop Joe Smith made for the con. He did produce a breast-plate and set of large glasses as well. Smith was a very clever criminal.

", Smithsonian Admits to Destruction of Thousands of Giant Human Skeletons in Early 1900’s," The cover-up allegedly destroyed evidence showing giant human remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America.
 The pieces of evidence were ordered to be destroyed by high-level administrators to “protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution at the time” according to the court ruling.
 The allegations stemming from the
  American Institution of Alternative Archeology
 (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900’s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution.
 During the court case, new elements were brought to light as several Smithsonian whistleblowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height, a reality mainstream archeology cannot admit to for different reasons, claims AIAA spokesman, James Churchward.
 A giant human femur uncovered in Ohio in 2011 by the American Association for Alternative Archeology, similar to the evidence presented in court
 A turning point of the court case was when a 1.3-meter long human femur bone was shown as evidence in court of the existence of such giant human bones.
 The evidence came as a blow to the Smithsonian’s lawyers as the bone had been stolen from the Smithsonian by one of their high-level curators in the mid-1930’s who had kept the bone all his life and which had admitted on his deathbed in writing of the undercover operations of the Smithsonian.
  «It is a terrible thing that is being done to the American people,» he wrote in the letter.
 The US Supreme Court has since forced the Smithsonian Institution to publicly release classified information about anything related to the “destruction of evidence pertaining to the mound builder culture” and to elements “relative to human skeletons of greater height than usual”, a ruling the AIAA is extremely enthused about.
  «Finally, after over a century of lies, the truth about our giant ancestors shall be revealed to the world» he acknowledges, visibly satisfied by the court ruling.
 The documents are scheduled to be released in 2020 and the operation will be coordinated by an independent scientific organization to assure political neutrality.
 And is well known that planet Earth rests on the back of four elephants….!!!!! ( ).
 It is clearly stated in Genesis 6:1-4, giants already exist long time ago. And it was before the floodeven waters.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/ireland-archaeologists-discover-remains-of-new-humanoid-species/
", Ireland: Archaeologists Discover Remains of New Humanoid Species," The specimens measuring between 47 and 61 centimeters are presumably from an entirely new species of humanoid, distinct from modern humans, which would have survived until the 12th or 13th century AD.
 The bones which were presumably partially unearthed by a recent rainfall, and were found by three local children who were playing in the area.
 The young boys immediately contacted the police, believing they had found the remains of murdered children. The medical examiner called on the site, rapidly understood that this was not a modern crime scene, but seemed instead to be an unusual archeological site.
 He contacted the University College Dublin to ask for help, and the institution sent Professor Edward James McInnes to analyze the discovery.
 The bodies of two females and one male were discovered with a small number of artifacts in what appeared to have been a small settlement, near the banks of the river Boyne.
 The team of archaeologists led by Professor McInnes has named the species
  Homo minusculus
 , which means either ‘
  Tiny Man’
 or ‘
  Is small in comparison’.
 This tiny axe blade was found near the body of the male individual. It is presumed to have been used as both a weapon and a tool.
 Various small stone Tools and weapons were found near the bodies, including an axe, two knives, a spear point and even two miniature sewing needles.
 These items suggest that the Homo Minisculus had only reached a technological level comparable to human hunters-gatherers from the Paleolithic period, as no pottery or metal items have been found on the site.
 Many bones from various small animals including squirrels, hares, moles, and hedgehogs were found near the settlement, many of which bore traces of cooking.
 The various dating analyses realized on the bones and artifacts have shown that they dated from somewhere between 1145 and 1230 AD, which means that the species would have coexisted with modern humans for more than 45000 years.
 This amazing discovery suggests that many tales and stories from the Middle Ages which were considered as fantastic by historians could indeed be based on real facts.
  Homo minusculus
 could have inspired stories of leprechauns, elves, and brownies that are common in European folklore.
 Professor McInnes and his team believe that
  Homo minusculus
 could have disappeared due to the destruction of its habitat by surrounding human communities.
 It remains unclear at the moment if Homo Minusculus evolved from Homo erectus, from Homo sapiens idaltu or even from Homo sapiens sapiens, but its morphological similarities with modern humans suggest that it evolved as a separate subspecies towards the end of the human lineage.
 The explanation for its small size also remains a mystery, but Professor McInnes believes it could be linked to the scarcity of resources during the most recent glacial period which extended the last years of the Pleistocene, from approximately 110,000 to 12,000 years ago.
 After the discovery of the
  Homo Floresiensis
 (that would have stood about 1.1 m in height) in 2003, on the island of Flores in Indonesia, a human subspecies which is believed to have gone extinct about 30000 years ago, this new find proves that many other hominin subspecies did indeed coexist with modern humans for thousands of years.
 Humans are such rude creatures…i do not understand why..i mean no offense to any of you but why must we be so cold towards eachothers opinions..aren’t they opinions for a reason?
 45000 years coexisting without anyone knowing…so who says they are extinct ?!?…I never doubted the “little People”…:)
 Has anyone thought that perhaps these remains are Pictish in origin ?
 Darby did not kill the little people.
 But little people it is possible….

 The scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor.
  The remains of two war chariots were also discovered scattered over an area of approximately 200 square meters.
 They estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site.
 This magnificient blade from an egyptian khopesh, was certainly the weapon of an important character. It was discovered near the remains of a richly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman.
 Many clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus.
 First of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area.
 The sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted.
 This new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten.
 For centuries, the famous biblical account of the “Red Sea Crossing” was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.
 “It brings a brand new perspective on a story that many historians have been considering for years as a work of fiction and suggesting that other biblical stories like the Plagues of Egypt could indeed have a historical base.
 A lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered.
 If yourl dnt understand the trinity ,I will explain .

 Sorry….JW’s…
 The NWT is an abomination to God.
 It denies the Trinity and the Person of the Holy Spirit amongst other horrific mistranslations

 The positions of the bodies and the fact that they were stuck in a vast quantity of clay and rock imply that they could have died in a mudslide or a tidal wave.

 “This astounding discovery brings undeniable scientific proof that one the most famous episodes of the Old Testament was indeed based on a historical event,” Professor Gader said during the press conference.

", Ruins of Ancient City Discovered in Australian Desert," The important number of tombs and artifacts already discovered on the site suggests that it could have been the capital of an ancient empire, completely unknown to historians until now.
 The site which was first noticed on satellite pictures taken in October 2013, using a newly developed ground-penetrating radar.
 The images revealed many 90° angles and various common geographic figures over a 16 km
  2
 area, leading the team of scientists to direct some archaeological excavations on the spot, starting in May 2014.
 Over the last few months, many structures have been unearthed including what looks like a royal palace, a few temples, large rainwater reservoirs, workshops and dozens of houses.
 287 individual tombs have already been discovered in a small necropolis located just outside the ancient city. The bodies are mostly of proto-aboriginal origins, but also surprisingly include a few Polynesian and Asian individuals.
 Professor Walter Reese, in charge of the site, claims that the extent of the site and the superposition of various layers of constructions, suggests that it was occupied for 400 to 500 years, from approximately 470-80 AD, up until the 9th Century.
 He believes that the city could have held between 20000 and 30000 inhabitants, making it the most important center of civilization in the Southern Pacific at the time.
 The various artifacts gathered from the site suggest that the city flourished thanks to some form of control over various gold mining operations in Southern Australia.
 The precious metal was purified and transformed by the hundreds of goldsmiths of the city before being traded for various other goods through an extensive network reaching as far as New Zealand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and even China and India.
 Thousands of artifacts have been recovered, including some 756 items made of gold. This bowl weighing 2.8 kilograms was found inside one of the temples.
 Professor Reese believes that the city could have been abandoned after some climatic changes in the 9th Century brought a dramatic decrease in the level of rainfall, making the city unsustainable.

 “This was certainly the capital of a vast empire, that practised some sort of international trade” says Mr Reese. “The fact that we have discovered some bodies of various origins suggests that this state could have been a very influential throughout the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia. We have found many objects on the site that were obviously imported from other regions, like rice, flax or lacquer.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/usa-viking-ship-discovered-near-mississipi-river/
", USA: Viking Ship Discovered Near Mississippi River," A team of archeologists from the University of Memphis that was rapidly called to the site, confirmed that the ship is most certainly a Viking Knarr, suggesting the Norse would have pushed their exploration of America a lot further than historians previously thought.
 The heavily damaged ship was found near the confluence of the Wolf and Mississippi rivers and lies on a private property.
 Knarrs were naval vessels that were built by the Norsemen from Scandinavia and Iceland for Atlantic voyages but also used for trade, commerce, exploration, and warfare during an era known as the Viking Age, that goes approximately from 793 to 1066 AD.
 They were clinker built, which means the overlapping of planks riveted together. It was capable of sailing 75 miles (121 km) in one day and held a crew of about 20 to 30 men.
 One of the only artifacts on the site, this sword was probably abandoned after it broke, suggesting a violent battle.
 This new discovery could be one of the oldest evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, and it certainly brings to mind the famous colony of “Vinland” mentioned in the
  Icelandic Sagas.
 This mythical colony would have been established by Leif Ericson around the same period as the settlement at l’Anse aux Meadows, in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, the most famous site of a Norse or Viking settlement in North America outside Greenland.
 The carbon dating of the new ship estimates that it dates from between 990  and 1050 AD, approximately the period associated with Vinland and the various Canadian sites (L’Anse aux Meadows, Tanfield Valley, Avayalik Islands).
 Unfortunately, very few other artifacts have yet been found on the site, suggesting the crew must have most likely abandoned the ship and continued on foot.
 Professor James Milbury, who leads the research team working on the site, believes the Norse could have been killed by Chickasaw natives.
 More searches are to be expected in the area over the next few years, as scientists will now certainly try to look for any artifacts or historical traces that could lead them to understand what happened to the crew of the ship.
 Many myths from local native tribes will also be analyzed by historians from the team to see if they could hold useful information, as both Chickasaw and Choctaw mythologies include many stories of fights against “red-haired devils”.
 Or the natives were killed by the Vikings lol
 Our ancestors are always first

 It has a length of about 16 meters, a beam of 4.5 meters, and a hull that is estimated capable of carrying up to 24 to 28 tons, a typical size for this type of ship.

 Butternuts found in the Newfoundland site had already suggested that the Norse had explored the continent because they do not grow naturally north of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, hundreds of kilometers away from any known Viking settlement.

 This could mean that the that the Viking had actually developed a far wider trade network in the Americas that what was traditionally believed.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/pakistan-cannabis-discovered-in-prehistoric-tomb/
", Pakistan: Cannabis Discovered in Prehistoric Tomb,"  Chitral| Archaeologists excavating at a prehistoric site in the Hindu Kush mountains, have discovered what could be the most ancient proof of intentional use of a psychoactive substance by humans. While searching the site of a Paleolithic settlement estimated to be 120 000 years old, scientists discovered seeds, resin and ashes, associated to the
   indica
  subspecies of the
   cannabis sativa
  plant.
 Discovered on the shores of the Kunar river in December 2013, in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the site is one of the oldest ever found in South Asia. According to Professor Muzaffar Kambarzahi of the National Institute of Historical &amp; Cultural Research (NIHCR) of the Quaid-i-Azam University, in charge of the team of scientists excavating the site, the various caves composing the settlement would have been inhabited for more than 2500 years during neolithic period. The historian has already elaborated a theory to explain the presence of cannabis on the site:
   “According to the location and context in which the cannabis was found, leads us to believe it was used for ritual purposes. It seems that the occupants of the site threw large quantities of leaves, buds and resin in the fireplace situated on the far end of the cave, filling the entire site with psychotropic smoke.”
 A chemical analysis executed on a small pottery jar found in the tomb of what seems to be a local chieftain or shaman, revealed that the vessel contained cannabis resin, also known as hashish, suggesting the plant was also associated with burial ceremonies and possibly other sacred rituals.
 A wide variety of different Tools have been found on the site, including hand axes, knives, scrapers, spear points, sickles and querns.
 The oldest evidence of the inhalation of cannabis smokes known before the discovery of this new site, is to be found in the 3rd millennium BCE, as indicated by charred cannabis seeds found in a ritual brazier at an ancient burial site in present day Romania. In 2003, a leather basket filled with cannabis leaf fragments and seeds was found next to a 2,500- to 2,800-year-old mummified shaman in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. Evidence for the consumption of cannabis has also been found in Egyptian mummies dated about 950 BC. Cannabis is also known to have been used by the ancient Hindus of India and Nepal thousands of years ago. The herb was called ganjika in Sanskrit.
 Is that a pack of Zig zags next to him?
 I use weed for medication and it works fine for me
 Most caves in the Middle East been lived in for a grip. It’s hard to pick apart the layers when it’s been a home for tens of thousands of years. It ain’t 120000 years ago though. It’s 12000 years ago. The last glacial period evolved humans. We came out of it smart and ambitious enough to domesticate plants and animals for the first time. And of course big doobies!
 I here ther’s a site that helps people find a marijuana doctor, I think it was called cannabisfriendlydoctors.com maybe you could pass this on. Just thought it might help someone.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/georgia-amateur-divers-find-long-lost-nuclear-warhead/
", Georgia: Amateur Divers Find Long-Lost Nuclear Warhead," Jason Sutter and Christina Murray were admiring the marine life of the area when they stumbled upon a Mark 15 thermonuclear bomb that had been lost by the United States Air Force more than 50 years ago.
 The couple from London in Ontario, was on a two-week vacation in Georgia and Florida to practice their favorite hobby, scuba diving when they decided to dive near the shores of Tybee Island.
 While admiring the plants and fishes near the sea floor, they noticed a large cylindrical item partially covered by sand.
 They investigated the object and found out that it was actually a sort of bomb or missile, so they decided to contact the authorities.
 The couple is still shocked after their frightening discovery and say they will avoid diving for the rest of their trip.
 Rapidly understanding the gravity of the situation, the 911 operator contacted every possible emergency service, including the coast guard and the military, leading to the deployment of more than 20 ships and 1500 men in the area.
 Using the GPS coordinates given by the couple, they rapidly located the powerful 3.8 megaton bomb.
 An unmanned submarine was sent to determine the condition of the bomb before explosive experts were sent to disarm it.
 Fortunately, the thermonuclear weapon produced in 1955 seemed in sufficiently good shape for a team of Navy seals to try to defuse it.
 They successfully deactivated the warhead after hours of strenuous work, allowing the rest of the bomb to be moved.
  The delicate recovery operation took more than 48 hours, but the bomb was finally recovered and transported Mayport Naval Station in Florida.
  A full set of tests and analysis will now be performed on the warhead to evaluate its actual state and the possible ecological and health hazard that its presence in the bay for 50 years could represent.
 Navy explosive ordnance Disposal technicians spent nearly five hours working on the warhead before they were able to extract the detonator and the uranium core of the weapon, allowing the fuselage to be moved.
 The federal and state authorities were well-aware that a nuclear warhead had been lost in the area in the 1950’s and had never been recovered, but no efforts had been done for years to recover it.
 It was lost on the night of February 5, 1958, when a B-47 Stratojet bomber carrying the 7,600-pound hydrogen bomb on a  simulated combat mission off the coast of Georgia collided with an F-86 Saberjet fighter at 36,000 feet of altitude.
 The collision destroyed the fighter and severely damaged a wing of the bomber, leaving one of its engines partially dislodged.
 The bomber’s pilot, Maj. Howard Richardson was instructed by the Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. to jettison the H-bomb before attempting a landing.
 Richardson dropped the bomb into the shallow waters of Wassaw Sound, near the mouth of the Savannah River, where he believed the bomb would be swiftly recovered.
 The crew did not see an explosion when the bomb struck the sea and they managed to land the B-47 safely at the nearest base.
 For the following six weeks, the Air Force looked for the bomb without success.
 Underwater divers scoured the depths, troops tromped through nearby salt marshes, and a blimp hovered over the area attempting to spot a hole or crater in the beach or swamp.
 Researches were finally abandoned and the bomb remained hidden for more than 50 years until the unlucky couple stumbled upon it.
 Yea I’ve knew about it thought it was closer inland , gov is nutts , what else is out there lol

 “I noticed an object that looked like a metal cylinder, which I thought was an oil barrel”


 “When I dug it up a bit, I noticed that it was actually a lot bigger and that there was some writing on the side. When I saw the inscription saying that it was a Mk-15 nuclear bomb, I totally freaked out. I caught Chritina by the arm and made signs to tell her we had to leave. We made an emergency ascent, went back to shore and then we called 911.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/loggers-accidentally-cut-down-worlds-oldest-tree-in-amazon/
", Loggers Accidentally Cut Down World’s Oldest Tree in Amazon Forest," The giant Samauma tree, that is thought to be over 5,800 years old judging on its concentric rings and estimated to be close to 40 meters in height, was a major part of the native tribes’ cultural landscape, countless generations of natives having witnessed the long duration of the tree and having included it in their own culture.
 Native communities alarmed local media outlets and conservation groups when Aotlcp-Awak, or Mother tree in local dialects, was reported sawed down by heavy machinery
  «They have murdered the Mother spirit knowingly, they have done this to kill our people and take the spoils of the land» he adds, visibly shaken by the destruction of the millennia-old Samauma tree.
 Anna Golding, a local researcher for non-profit organization and conservancy group Rainforest Protection Coalition (RPC), an initiative stemming from Berkeley University in California, believes the ‘incident’ was intentional.
 « There are large portions of this national reserve that are rich in oil and natural gas. There has been committed action by energy corporations to lobby the government to exploit the area for years. The protected zones have been cut in half over the past decade and this is only their latest attempt to get rid of the local populations who are fighting to preserve their cultural heritage and lifestyle» she admits.
 Between 1991 and 2014, the total area of forest lost in the Amazon has more than tripled, with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle.
 Rainforests are the richest places on earth holding the majority of the planet’s biodiversity, yet 100 acres of rainforests are cleared every minute, estimates a recent 2017 World Resources Institute report.
 Matses Indigenous Reserve should receive all profits from the logging of this wonderful tree, at a minimum. A hefty fine leved on the company that made cutting of this tree possible. Make it so all companies in this business will think twice about who they are sending out to cut. Oversee operations more sensibly
 Loggers should be banned as their practices are ruining the world – deforestation causes more trouble than it’s worth.

 «It is the Mother spirit of the rainforest, from this spirit-tree came the life force of all things living. They have destroyed Aotlcp-Awak, they have brought darkness upon not only our people, but the whole world» explains local tribesman leader Tahuactep of the Matsés tribe.

 «For many generations, the Mother tree has brought my people health and good fortune. The roots of the Mother tree spread throughout the rainforest and bring its life spirit to the world. What will be left of the animals, of the plants, and of our people now that the Mother spirit is gone?» asks Kalahuaptl, a local shaman.

 «These actions are clearly perpetrated with the consent of local authorities and the government. If this wasn’t the case, why are local enforcement agencies not prosecuting these corporations? Why are these loggers free to keep doing what they are doing? That is the bigger question» she adds.

", Mysterious Remains of A Whale Found in a Field in Utah," 69-year-old Michael Woodson, found a 12-meter-long humpback whale laying lifeless in the middle of one of his fields, hundreds of kilometers away from its natural habitat.
 The Farmington City Police was called on the site to investigate since the farmer thought that the cetacean could have been left there as a creepy prank by some neighborhood youngsters.
 The investigators rapidly dismissed the possibility, however, as no traces of vehicles or machinery large enough to carry it were found anywhere near the animal.
 The police admit that they are almost clueless at the moment as to how the marine mammal found its way on Mr. Woodson’s property.
 “We have to admit that we find this case very puzzling,” said Captain Terry Dawson from the Farmington police. “It is certainly the first time that we see anything like this in our city, and we have very little information for now as to how the animal got there.”
 A few witnesses have reported seeing some strange flying object in the area over the last two days and the authorities have confirmed that the 911 operators have received a few dozen calls from all over the region reporting such sightings, but they refuse to link both events for the moment.
 Michael Woodson still believes that some neighborhood youngsters placed the 25-ton animal there as a prank.
 A team of biologists from the University of Utah has already been called on the site to examine the body of the whale and realize various tests and analysis before it is removed from Mr. Woodson’s property.
 The scientists are trying to determine if the animal could have actually lived in the Great Salt Lake which is only a few kilometers away from the farm.
 The various police forces of the area are now asking the public to report any information that could prove helpful in solving this strange case.
 Anyone that might possess any information on the case is asked to contact the  Farmington City Police, which is in charge of the investigation.
 They should bring Scott Adams in for questioning
 The moron seems to enjoy saying red neck often. I guess it’s a new word he learned in his illiteracy class and he’s just trying to memorize it.
 There are only 4 helicopters in the U.S. that can carry that much weight. All 4 belong to the US Military. So there is your answer on what can move that much weight. Now why in the hell was it that far from land?
 I meant that far from the ocean.

", 15-Ton Prehistoric Shark Captured Off Coast Of Pakistan," The giant creature first thought to be a great white shark was rapidly declared by experts to be an unknown species of shark as it’s great weight and size were unheard of.
  Analysis of the teeth suggests the shark to be a parent of the Megalodon,
   an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 28 to 1.5 million years ago, during the Cenozoic Era.
 Great white sharks can reach up to 7 tons at full growth, a size that is no match for this giant prehistoric shark that can reach an imposing 20 meters in length and possibly weight up to 30 tons, depending on estimates.
 More than 20 local fishermen were needed to haul the giant beast onto the shore before authorities later brought heavy machinery in
 Smithsonian Institute researcher, Jeff Mayor, says this is the “catch of a lifetime” and was “highly unexpected”.
  “This is an incredible opportunity to work on a real specimen instead of trying to figure out the whole picture from different fossil composites” admits Smithsonian paleontologist Jeff Mayor, visibly enthused by the discovery.
 A quick autopsy revealed the creature lives under great depths, feeding on giant squid and other fish not commonly found near the surface, which makes the discovery even more incredible to experts.
  “Are rising sea temperatures forcing these beasts to come up closer to the shores or was this animal simply hurt and suffering from a disorienting handicap, these questions are left unanswered” claims local marine biologist Rajar Muhammar.
 The giant sea creature had a total of 276 teeth in its jaws, spanning 5 rows with it’s biggest tooth measuring an incredible 15 cm
 The recent discovery has raised great enthusiasm from experts abroad who are pondering the fact that other thought to be extinct species might still be dwelling in the depths of the seas.
 “This is very exciting news for the future of ocean exploration as technology is permitting us to go deeper and deeper every day” explains marine biologist Suzan Chopper from the University of Sydney, Australia.
 “I just don’t know how well our submarines would do against a giant monster like this” she adds.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/argentina-128-year-old-man-claims-he-is-adolf-hitler/
", Argentina: 128-year-old man claims he is Adolf Hitler," In an interview with the ultra-conservative newspaper
  El Patriota
 , the naturalized German immigrant explains that he arrived in the country in 1945 with a passport identifying him Herman Guntherberg.
 He claims that his passport was a fake one produced by the Gestapo near the end of the war and that he’s actually the former Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler.
 He says he’s decided to come out of hiding after the Israeli secret services officially abandoned their policy of pursuing former Nazi war criminals last year.
 The elderly man claims he’s preparing to publish his autobiography in order the restore his public image.
 He says his book will be written under the name Adolf Hitler and should be available in September.
 Many people, including his wife of 55 years, Angela Martinez, believe that Herman Guntherberg isn’t really Adolf Hitler, but is simply suffering from dementia.
 Ms. Martinez claims her husband never spoke about Hitler until approximately two years ago when he began showing signs of Alzheimer’s disease.
 She believes her husband may possibly have been a Nazi and that he may feel guilty about his past, but she’s convinced he’s not Hitler.
 Mr. Gunterberg’s wife claims he’s not Adolf Hitler, only a senile old man who is beginning to lose his mind.
 Even if the elderly man’s claim seem rather questionable, they have sparked an animated debate in Israel and in the American Jewish community concerning the future of surviving Nazi war criminals.
 Mossad had proved its ambition and global reach in the past with the capture of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1960 in Argentina, but it has abandoned this mission over recent years.
 The Wiesenthal Center, which is still trying to find and prosecute Nazi criminals, has publicly criticized Israel in March, saying the Jewish state was ‘barely cooperating’ to its mission.
 More than 70 years after the end of World War 2, few states and institutions are still trying to find and prosecute the surviving Nazis and most of them will certainly die without ever being punished for their crimes.

", USA: Mysterious Nazi submarine from WWII discovered in Great Lakes," The U-boat was spotted for the first time by amateur scuba divers in late January and they had contacted the authorities.
 Archaeologists associated with Niagara University and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on the site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.
 A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship.
 The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.
 The divers of the U.S. Coastguard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.
 The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”.
 It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coast.
 Professor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.
 A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. Navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.
 “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”
  The restoration
  of the submarine
  could take
  more than two years
 , but once
  completed
 , the museum
  ship
 is expected to
  become one of the major
  tourist
  attractions of the region.

 A sub could not get over Niagara Falls, so it could only get into Lake Ontario, not the others.
 Were any bodies found?
 Please take the temperature down a bit. Let us recover investigate and notify any next of kin. Treat their war dead as we would wish ours to be treated. As a retired submariner I look forward to hearing more.

 “We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/australia-archaeologists-unearth-ruins-of-viking-trade-center/
", Australia: Archaeologists Unearth Ruins of Viking Trade Center," The scientists, associated with the Department of Archaeology of the University of Sydney, were called to the site after some locals discovered what looked like the foundation of an ancient building in July, near Derby.
 The archaeologists, directed by Professor Allison Fletcher, were expecting a site from the early colonial period, but they rapidly realized that they were dealing with something completely different.
 They have unearthed the foundations of three larger buildings which were identified as houses, and two smaller workshops identified as a carpentry, which was also used as a boat repair area, and a smithy, containing a forge and iron slag.
 The type of construction and the items found on the site are very similar to the various Viking colonies discovered in Greenland and Iceland.
 The scientists have also unearthed a total of sixteen tombs, including these warriors who were buried with their weapons and treasure.
 The archaeologists have discovered a large quantity and variety of artifacts on the site, including a few weapons and blacksmithing tools, some bronze and silver jewelry, four ivory combs, a few stone oil lamps, a dozen iron rivets and a bone knitting needle.
 While most of the items seem to be of Norse origin, a few of the items suggest that the inhabitants of the site were either conducting piracy in the region or they were part of an extended maritime trade network.
 Two broken pieces of porcelain, a bronze vessel and a jade ring from China were found in the tomb of one of the women, and some semi-precious stones from India and Sri Lanka were found in the tomb of one of the warriors.
 This proves that the Vikings had some form of contacts with the Asian continent, but the nature of these contacts remains uncertain.
 This large bronze vessel, found in the tomb if a Norse woman of high status, was manufactured in Southeastern China in the 9th or 10th Century.
 Professor Fletcher believes that the Norsemen could have chosen this site for its natural harbor, the availability of eucalyptus wood and the region’s abundant iron ore.
 It’s a long distance from the site of any known Viking settlement, expedition or raid, however, and it remains unclear how the Norsemen actually reached Australia.
 The Vikings were a seafaring people who raided and traded from their Scandinavian homelands across wide areas of northern and central Europe, as well as Russia, during the late 8th to late 11th centuries.
 Using their advanced seafaring skills and their famous longships, they are known to have created colonies and trading posts throughout the North Atlantic islands, navigating as far as the north-eastern coast of North America.
 The Vikings are also known to have raided North Africa and some Mediterranean islands, but this is the first time that any trace of their presence is found in the Indian Ocean.
 It is nice to know my ancestors were such powerful and capable people, especially since “raiding and trading” are the basis of our modern economy {see: “disaster capitalism”, destabilization}

 “Everything on the site suggests that this was a Viking colony,”


 “Honestly, we have no idea how they made it here, but these people were almost certainly Norsemen. The various dating analysis have shown that the site dated from around 1000 AD, precisely at the time of “Viking expansion”. The architecture and the various objects found on the site are all consistent with other Norse colonies or trading posts.”

 “The most probable route is certainly by going around Africa and rounding the Cape of Good Hope, like Vasco de Gamma did centuries later,”


 “If we consider the Vikings’ navigational techniques, they must have remained close to the African and then Asian coasts during the whole trip, meeting countless cities and people along the way. I can’t even imagine how many difficulties they must have faced before they made it here!”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/ottomans-were-the-first-to-reach-the-moon-says-turkish-president/
"," “Ottomans Were The First to Reach The Moon,” says Turkish President"," Mr. Erdoğan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than 300 years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque “in the crater” where they landed.
   “It is alleged that the first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in 1969,”
 Erdoğan said.
   “In fact, Muslim space explorers reached our satellite 334 years before that, in 1635. Everyone knows the story of the famous aviator, Lagâri Hasan Çelebi, the “Ottoman Rocket Man”, who made the first successful manned rocket flight in 1633. What you might not know, is that he attempted to reach the moon, two years later, and could very well have succeeded!”
 The story of Lagari Hasan Çelebi was purported by a famous 17th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya Çelebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan Çelebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (63.5 kg or 140 lbs) of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul.
 This 17th-century engraving depicts one of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi’s famous rocket flights, but it’s unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in 1635.
 President Erdoğan’s surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims.
   “Why do you not believe it? Because you’ve never believed that a Muslim can do such a thing, just like you’ve never believed that our ancestors could manage to launch ships in the Golden Horn after transporting them across land,”
 Erdoğan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II’s conquest of Istanbul in 1453.
   “This claim is not new. A number of academics in Turkey and in the rest of the world have made this claim, and I believe they are right. NASA may have destroyed most of the physical evidence of the Ottoman’s success during the Apollo 11 mission, but we’ll try to find any evidence that might have escaped the cover up.”
 The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them.
 The description of the flying engine used by Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is pretty vague and doesn’t really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate.
 The story of Lagâri Hasan Çelebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the “aviator” could have survived a flight into outer space.
 His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November 11, 2009, in the episode “Crash and Burn”.  The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya Çelebi’s descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period;
 The team noted that Evliya Çelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagâri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been “extremely difficult” for a 17th-century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/remains-of-nazi-officer-discovered-inside-100-year-old-giant-catfish/
", Remains of Nazi Officer Discovered inside 100-Year Old Giant Catfish," The stomach of the monstrous fish contained fragments of human bones, as well as German military artifacts dating back to the Second World War.
 Alfons Brzozowski and Marek Zdanowicz were fishing near the Oder’s confluence with the Bóbr river on April 6, when they made an astonishing catch: a gigantic Wels catfish, measuring 12 feet (3.68 meters) and weighing 413 pounds (187.5 kg).
 Their celebration was rapidly transformed into interrogation, and then disgust, when they opened the animal’s belly. Among a large quantity of half-digested fish, they discovered an old metal insignia dating back to Nazi Germany, as well dozens of human bone fragments.
 The two fishermen rapidly contacted the police, who opened an investigation to determine the origin of the remains.
 The insignia found in the fish’s belly, turned out to be a German SS hat eagle, dating back to Nazi Germany, that was usually worn on the front of the SS dress hat.
 The examination of the bones enabled the authorities to determine that they belonged to a Caucasian man in his early twenties, who died many decades ago.
 The biologists who examined the fish, for their part, confirmed that the enormous specimen was probably aged between 90 and 110 years old, making it one of the oldest catfish specimens ever found.
 Further analysis of the artifacts and the bones have revealed that they had indeed been ingested by the fish during the 1940s, and were very likely the remains of a German SS officer, killed during the occupation of Poland.
 The team of forensic experts who proceeded to the tests, could not determine, however, if the man was actually killed by the catfish or if he was already dead when he was eaten by the animal.
 The stomach of the enormous catfish contained more than a dozen corroded bone fragments, mainly parts of a human neck and skull.
 The Wels catfish is a large fish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe.
 With a possible total length up to 4 m (13 ft) and a maximum weight of over 400 kg (880 lb), it is the second largest freshwater fish in the region after the beluga sturgeon.
 Individuals of this species have been observed lunging out of the water to grab pigeons, ducks, rats, cats and even dogs, on land.
 Exceptionally large specimens have even been rumored to attack humans in rare instances, but this is the first time that human remains are actually found inside one of these fishes.
 A report in the Austrian newspaper
  Der Standard
 on 5 August 2009, mentions such a catfish dragging a fisherman near Győr, in Hungary, under water.
 The fish allegedly caught the man by his right leg after he attempted to grab the fish in a hold. The man barely escaped with his life, from a fish which must have weighed over 100 kg (220 lb), according to the fisherman.
 The catfish was military hero!
 Should of been released!
 A catfish that kills nazis,would make great book material
 He should be given a full military funeral with his coffin dressed with the German flag of the time. He is a war hero after all.
 Shut up nazi scum more like
 The remains of a caucasian man and the remains of a SS officer?! So the fish had to have eaten 2 men – ONE CAUCASIAN MAN AND ONE SS OFFICER.
 There were no caucasian men drafted into the SS. The caucasian men/soldiers, were the enemies of Nazi Germany and so they were the enemies of the Waffen SS.
 Plus – the soldiers of the SS were much older then in their 20’s.
 They forgot to add that the fish was eaten alive by those fishermen!
 haha what a hero, that is exactly what a nazi deserves. Shame the catfish had to die.

 “We have only a few fragments of bones, and much of the skeleton is missing”


 “We don’t have enough evidence to determine the cause of death, but we are almost certain that the bones are those of a German SS officer.  We found a SS hat eagle, as well as two buttons and a cufflink from the same uniform. Unfortunately, many bones and artifacts seem to have been “evacuated”  naturally by the fish over the years and the DNA in the bones was damaged by the gastric juices, so a formal identification is impossible for the moment.”

", 200 Million Years Old Dinosaur Egg Hatches in Berlin Museum," The egg which was believed to be petrified was preserved in a small storage room situated right next to the boiler room.
 When the system started overheating a few weeks ago, it seems to have surprisingly initiated the incubation process, leading the egg to hatch.
 The Gasosaurus is classified as a carnivorous tetanuran dinosaur of the therapod family originating from China.
 “This dinosaur previously remained a mystery because all we had to study were a few precarious remains” explained the scientist.
 “Now we have a live one! I feel like I’m in Jurassic Park the movie! » explains the specialist, visibly enthusiast.
 The specimen has already been transferred to the Berlin Zoo where it can be studied in a secure environment.
 A few facts have already been made public concerning the creature, including its size and weight, allegedly 41 centimeters tall with a weight of 11 kilograms.
 I think this event would hit the world news and shake the foundations of science. Let’s see the proof?

", Chinese Lunar Rover Finds No Evidence Of American Moon Landings," 200 high-ranking officials from the Chinese Space Program have signed a petition asking explanations from the American government and the release of classified NASA information concerning the American moon landings that would prove to the World that the moon landings were not an elaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the World about America’s space program capabilities.
 These allegations have come up through recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese moon rover that allegedly found no traces of the American moon landings existing on the moon.
 Pictures taken from Yutu, the Chinese moon rover, that has landed on the moon in 2013, allegedly shows no proof whatsoever of the American moon landings ever happening
 These recent discoveries could strangely give credence to conspiracy theorists whom have claimed for decades that America had never gone to the moon but that the American moon landings were but an elaborate hoax to foul Russia into the space race and eventually, the nuclear arms race, with the purpose of ruining Russia, much like the financing of the Mujahideen forces during the Soviet Afghanistan war successfully achieved.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/texas-man-freed-after-outliving-99-year-prison-sentence-for-horse-theft/
", Texas: Man freed after outliving 99-year prison sentence for horse theft," Grandson of one the most famous horse thief in American history, Henry William Borne was arrested by the Texas Rangers in 1919 for being part of in an important horse-stealing ring.
 His father, Henry Borne Jr., was hanged in Fort Worth alongside one of their accomplices, Mark Thompson, on March 16, 1920.
 Borne, his father and seven other accomplices were accused of stealing over 7,000 horses and mules, including a lot of 1,735 horses destined to the American military effort in the first World War.
 The eight others were sentenced to death and hanged in 1920, while Borne, who was underage when the crimes were committed, was sentenced to 99 years in prison.
 Unexpectedly, the Amarillo native actually survived his sentence, which was spent in a total of 11 different detention centers.
 He was liberated this morning from the Central Unit Prison, in Sugar Land, after spending almost an entire century behind bars.
 Visibly emotional, Mr. Borne expressed his worries about adapting to life in the 21st Century.
 Despite his long incarceration, the 117-year old man also fears he could have difficulty adapting to a life without crime.
 Despite his fears, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice considers there is a “very low risk” that he will resume his life of crime.
 In fact, the number of horse theft has constantly dropped over the last century and the use of identification microchips over recent years has made such crimes much easier to solve.
 Punishment for horse theft can still be severe, as one woman in Arkansas was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the 2011 theft of five horses.
 How in the hell can they even entertain the thought he would return to a life of stealing horses away 117 years old. Nonetheless, im happy he made it and is now free to enjoy a year or so if life left. 117!! What the heck did they feed this man , organic vegetables!!!
 Poor guy he should have been released. WE just picked my father up from California Department of Corrections where he went in at 22 for robbery, no injuries. He is 69 now. No money, no clothes, he has me his only child and my kids and grandkids. There are thousands of people buried in there, forgotten and doing life for petty crimes due to 3 strikes law. What happened to no “Cruel and Unusual Punishment”. People are getting rich in the “prison” business in this country. Shame on California and the governors of all these states for back room deals and political gains with prison contracts. Deplorable!

", Man accused of raping a cow claims it is the reincarnation of his dead wife," Rajiv Chowdhury, 34, was intercepted this week by Atascosa County police after ranch owner Ted Bukowski called police after he found the half-naked man sexually assaulting one of his cows.
 Bukowski first believed his cattle were being harassed by coyotes until he discovered it was, in fact, a man that was the source of all the disturbance.
 “He asked me not to shoot. He told me he wouldn’t do it again if I didn’t call the police” Bukowski, 67, told reporters.
 “I don’t know what those Hindus preach at church, but that sure sounds to me like the church of the Devil,” he added, laughing.
 Ted Bukowski, 67, believed his cattle were being harassed by coyotes until he discovered Chowdhury, 34, sexually molesting one of his cows.
 Professor of Religious studies at the University of Houston, Janet Fitzgerald, believes Rajiv Chowdhury’s sexual assault upon the cow must be understood in the specific cultural and religious context of Hinduism.
 “The man lost his wife last year and possibly was honest when he said he believed the animal was the reincarnation of his dead wife,” she told local reporters.
 “In Hinduism, sex with animals is not an uncommon theme and many of their deities share half-human, half-animal features,” she explained.
 Bestiality is currently illegal in the state of Texas since 2017 and offenders face a maximum penalty of a one year in prison and/or a fine of not more than $4,000, according to legal experts.

 “He said the cow was the reincarnation of his wife, and when I asked him what the hell he was talking about, he said the cow had the same eyes, smell, and taste than his deceased wife,” he recalled, visibly amused.

 “Certain religions such as Islam also allow sexual intercourse with animals under certain particular conditions. Every situation must be analyzed in its proper cultural and religious context,” she adds.

", Mortician arrested after spending 8 hours with penis stuck inside corpse," 67-year old Alfred Mortimer Evans was lying on the body of a 47-year old car accident victim when his colleagues arrived this morning and he was visibly stuck in this awkward position.
 He immediately admitted that he had been in this position for several hours and asked his co-workers for help.
 Unfortunately for him, his colleagues were unable to help him and they had to call the emergency services.
 Joey Dunmore, one of the paramedics who was called on the site, described the scene in an interview with the Savannah Daily Herald.
 It took paramedics more than an hour before they could free him, and he was then immediately arrested by officers of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department.
 17 criminal charges have been filed against Alfred Evans, including indecent treatment of a corpse, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs.
 Since the accused has worked on the night shift at the Chatham County Morgue for 43 years, and the investigators believe he could have sexually abused several other corpses in the past, and they expect to file more charges over the next few days.
 Captain John Monroe of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police said that investigators were looking for other possible victims and that more charges could be filed over the next few days.
 Mr. Evans’ lawyer, Chad Montgomery, is convinced that the accused is mentally ill.
 He demanded a psychiatric evaluation to determine if his client is fit to stand a trial, and the court has accepted his request.
 If he is judged fit, he faces a maximum of 85 in jail, possibly even more if other charges are added.
 The evaluation will take place over the next few weeks and the legal procedures are expected to begin in February.

 Mr. Meyers was diagnosed with a condition called clinical lycanthropy, a rare psychiatric syndrome that involves a delusion that the affected person can transform into, has transformed into, or is a non-human animal.
 Despite his condition, he had always lived a rather normal life until last week, when he decided to abandon his job and family to live naked in the forest.
 His wife Johanna says her husband’s decision was spontaneous and unexpected, even if he talked about being a squirrel for years.
 She also fears for his health since temperatures are extremely cold at this time of the year.
 Mr. Meyers’ wife and two children are afraid that he could get sick or die if he keeps living naked in the woods.
 The transspecies movement has gained in popularity in recent years and an increasing number of cases of people choosing to live as animals have attracted the attention of the media over recent years.
 According to experts, only a small portion of those, like Mr. Meyers, actually suffer from medical conditions explaining their lifestyle, while others choose to live this way.
 A man convinced he was a pelican attracted some attention on the issue last year after he jumped off a 45-story building and died in New Jersey, thinking he could fly.
 According to official statistics, between 3,000 and 5,000 Americans consider themselves to be “transspecies”.

", Former Russian spy claims he killed “the real Donald Trump” in 2006," 59-year Vladimir Petrovitch Volchenkov left his home in St-Petersburg in May to seek asylum in France, arguing that his life was in danger if he remained in Russia.
 He claims he spent 41 years working for the KGB and its successor the FSB and admits to killing over 180 people for the Russian state.
 Mr. Volchenkov says most of those victims were Russians perceived as threats by the Kremlin, but at least a dozen were influential foreigners.
 On his list, one name definitely stands out among the others: the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
 Mr. Volchenkov claims he killed Mr. Trump after an event in Prague in 2006, insisting that the man acting as president is an impostor.
 He says he strangled the billionaire in his hotel room and that the FSB immediately replaced the billionaire with a look-alike.
 Vladimir Volchenkov claims he only saw Mr. Trump as a businessman at the time and had no idea that the Kremlin intended to get their agent elected President.
 When asked about the claims during a press conference aboard Air Force One this morning, the president dismissed the claims as “lies and fake news”, adding “I’m the real me!”.
 Mr. Volchenkov’s claims have generated a lot of reactions and conspiracy theories on the social media.
 Many Trump supporters call him a fraud and a liar, while others accusing him of working for the Democrats.
 Many of Trump’s opponents on the other side hope the 59-year old man could hold the key to proving that the President is a Russian agent and that Moscow manipulated the election.
 Mr. Volchenkov says he will reveal all details about Trump’s killing and other assassinations in his autobiography which is set to be published in December.

 “I would do as ordered, no matter who the target was. I didn’t know who Mr. Trump was when I was ordered to kill him. I just did what I had to do.”

 “The secret services do that all the time. Some agents undergo facial surgery to look like certain people, who are then eliminated and replaced.”

", San Diego Zoo: Rhino has 96-hour-long erection after teenagers feed it Viagra," Arjuna, a thirteen-year-old male rhinoceros, caught zoo employees’ attention after sustaining an erection for more than several days.
 The animals bright, huge and red genitals have become a popular sight and a visitor favorite since the word spread on social media.
 Many on social media have even taken to nickname the animal Rhino Jeremy, in reference to Ron Jeremy, a legendary pornographic film actor.
 It is not known how long the young male rhinoceros will stay in erection, but surveillance camera footage showed what is believed to be an apple filled with Viagra pills being thrown at him by a group of teenagers.
 Veterinarian Helen Sue Fisher believes the amount of Viagra ingested should not give the animal on the endangered species list any long-term complications.
 “For sure being horny 24 hours a day might get exhausting but a few days of rest and he’ll be fine,” she told reporters, visibly amused by the whole situation.
 The San Diego Police Department has launched an official investigation into the matter but no suspects have been apprehended at the moment.

"," Donald Trump is addicted to penis enlargement pills, claims his ex-wife"," In an exclusive interview with CNTV-4, Ivana Trumps claimed the American President is obsessed with the size of his genitals, and has already tested “every product on the market” in order to increase the size of his penis.
 According to the former model and socialite, he even overdosed twice, in 1989 and 1991, after ingesting more than 300 penis enlargement pills in a day.
 She says the president still takes penis enlargement drugs, but has reduced and stabilized his consumption to approximately 45 to 60 pills a day.
 According to his ex-wife, Trump’s reddish skin color is a sign of high blood pressure, caused by his consumption of penis enlargement drugs.
 Donald Trump married his first wife Ivana in 1977, and they had three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric.
 She played an important role in her husband’s business until their high-profile divorce in 1991.
 During the procedure, she accused the real-estate tycoon of ‘rape,’ although she later clarified: not in the ‘criminal sense.’
 Despite a troublesome separation, Donald and Ivana Trump have remained close, and she even attended his inauguration as President.
 Only days after her ex-husband won the elections, she told the New York Post: “I will suggest that I be ambassador for the Czech Republic.”
 Some experts believe that by revealing shocking information to the media about the President, Ms Trump is attempting to put pressure on him in order to reach her objective.
 Typical greedy ex. She’s moved on to one night stands and backbiting insecurity-hes gone on to become president.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/trump-science-advisor-denies-apollo-moon-landings-ever-happened/
", Trump Science Advisor Denies Apollo Moon Landings Ever Happened," The controversial computer scientist already known for his strong stance against the science behind global warming has openly and vehemently criticized the space policy of the Barack Obama administration and its goal to reach Mars in 2030.
 “The Apollo moon landings are the biggest fraud in mankind’s history, even worse than all that global warming nonsense,” he added.
 Recently appointed science and technology advisor to Donald Trump, Yale University professor David Gelernter, in an exclusive interview with Science Today this week, claimed the Apollo moon landings never happened.
 This is not the first time the controversial professor has attacked the Apollo moon landings. In his 2012 book
   America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats)
 the author voices his concerns about the impossibility of space travel outside the Earth’s magnetic field.
 “In the modern age, we have never been outside the Earth’s magnetic field. With the exception of the alleged 24 human beings who flew lunar flights in the Apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972, all human spaceflights have taken place in low Earth orbit (LEO) or below. Even the International Space Station conducts all its operations in LEO,” he explained in his book.
 “Why is that? This is because orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation,” he wrote.
 The Yale professor also documented in his book how NASA was, and still is, aware of the impossibility of traveling beyond the Van Allen Belt, a highly charged radioactive belt that is part of the planet’s magnetic field.
 “The Apollo missions were supposed to be the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners, but even today, NASA scientists admit they can’t get past the Van Allen Belts” he claims in his 2012 book.
 “If NASA scientists honestly admit in 2012 that they still haven’t worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts, how the hell did we send human beings into space covered in aluminum foil suits? At a particular time when the Solar activity was at its peak? The answer is simple: It just never happened,” he concluded on the matter.
 Despite his controversial claims, David Gelernter is a world-renown and multiple award-winning computer scientist known for his contributions to parallel computation and his early prediction of the rise of the World Wide Web.
  Time Magazine
 profiled Gelernter as one of the
  100 most influential people of the 21st century
 in 2016, describing him as an “arch-genius.”
  The New York Times
 called him a computer science “rock star” and “one of the most brilliant and visionary computer scientists of our time.”
 Suitable consultant for Trump, but hardly a suitable professor for Yale University. It’s a shameю

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/russian-hooker-who-had-sex-with-donald-trump-mocks-his-tiny-penis/
", Russian hooker who had sex with Donald Trump mocks his “tiny penis”," In an interview with the Moscow Daily Herald, the young woman described in great details the night that she allegedly spent in Mr. Trump’s hotel room five years ago.
 Ms. Kamensky claims she was hired by Donald Trump along with two of her friends to perform several degrading sex acts, like urinating on him and on each other.
 She said that she had been shocked by the incredibly small size of his penis, and remembers laughing about it with the other two girls.
  “Many parts of his body are too small, not only his hands,” she told the Moscow Daily Herald.
 She described Mr.Trump’s genitals as being the size of a grape, barely one inch (2.5cm) long when fully erect.
 Ms. Kamensky says she was paid $10,000 for her night with Mr. Trump, which is more than the average Russian worker earns in a year.
 According to Ivana Kamensky, Donald Trump paid $30,000 for one night with her and two other prostitutes in July 2011 and asked them to perform many perverted sex acts.
 Ms. Kamensky’s claims seem to confirm the unverified allegations about Mr. Trump being caught on film with prostitutes in both Moscow and St Petersburg, causing a scandal already dubbed as the “Golden Shower Gate” by some media.
 The scandal finds its origin in a 35-page dossier compiled by a former MI6 agent, containing unverified allegations that Russian security officials have compromising material on Mr. Trump that could be used to blackmail him.
 According to the dossier, the Kremlin had been feeding Trump some compromising information on his opponents for years. It had also acquired compromising information on Trump himself that could be used as blackmail.
 There are allegations of “perverted” sex acts and also of frequent contact between Trump’s campaign and Russian government intermediaries.
 Mr. Trump angrily denied the claims made in the dossier during his first press conference as president-elect.
 He described the allegations as “fake news” and openly criticized the media who had covered the story.
 Considering Mr. Trump’s tendency to react personally to most critics on his Twitter account, it is quite probable that he will react to Ms. Kamensky’s claims over the next few days.
 who cares maybe she was to big, married men hire this trash to do what their wives won’t do
 Trump is pure unadulterated rich white trash. Anyone of any statue that can uphold him in being President is of the same low caliber.
 Amen we need a president worth having all his skeltons are coming out the closet
 I already knew he treated his wife like complete trash, but hiring prostitutes while married!?
 No respect for a president who commits adultery.

", Hairdresser arrested for making voodoo dolls from customers’ hair," According to the New-Orleans Police Department (NOPD), 29-year old Enoch Azaka collected the hair he cut from his customers at the
  Old City Barber Shop
 and used it in black magic rituals.
 New Orleans Police Chief Ronal Serpas says Mr. Azaka used his skills as a voodoo sorcerer to cause pain and illness to his victims in order to extort money and sexual favors.
 The victims described suffering from acute migraines, back pain, severe rashes, respiratory problems and even some sudden and eerie hemorrhages that would cause blood to come out of their nose, eyes, and ears.
 Mr. Azaka allegedly contacted them himself to explain that he was a powerful sorcerer and the cause of their pain.
 Two of his female customers claim that instead of money, the accused asked them for sex in exchange for “dispelling the curses” he had cast on them.
 According to the New Orleans Police Department, Mr. Asaka used black magic rituals to cast curses on at least 48 of his customers.
 Enoch Azaka now faces a total of 184 criminal charges, including 94 charges of theft, 32 charges of extortion and 48 charges of witchcraft.
 Witchcraft and the practice of magical arts are still illegal in Lousiana under an old French law that predates the state’s acquisition by the United States in 1803.
 The 1731 “
  Act against Sorcery and Witchcraft
 ” provides that anyone who should “
  use, practice, or exercise any witchcraft, enchantment, charm or sorcery
 ” shall be sentenced to a minimum of ten years of imprisonment.
 If found guilty on all charges, Mr. Azaka could get a fine of $1,125,000 and face a total of 835 years of imprisonment.
 He was freed a few hours after his arrest on a $120,000 bail and should be back in court in October for the beginning of his trial.
 He will use is skills to fix all of you and he will remain free to cause more havoc…
 Did the confiscate all the hair and dolls from him? I think releasing him even on a high bond was a huge mistake.
 The same thing I thought.. I just want to know what his work looks like. As if I walk into a salon &amp; the hairdresser looks like him. I’m walking right back out-Even if it were free.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/israel-man-claiming-to-be-a-time-traveler-turns-himself-in-for-the-killing-of-jesus-christ/
", Israel: Man claiming to be a time traveler turns himself in for the killing of Jesus Christ," The Jerusalem District Police has confirmed that an unidentified man dressed in a Roman armor presented himself this morning in its headquarters,  carrying a blood-covered spear-like weapon.
 The man, who speaks only in Latin, identified himself as the Roman centurion Caius Longinus Anxanumus and claimed to be a time traveler from the first century AD.
 According to police spokesman Jacob Levine, the man claims he’s the killer of Jesus Christ and that the weapon he carried is the one the “Holy Lance” that pierced the Christ in his side during the Crucifixion.
 The man also claimed that God tormented and tortured him for almost 2000 years to punish him for his crimes.
 The Jerusalem District Police believes the man might suffer from schizophrenia or similar mental issue and are asking the public for help in identifying him.
 He measures 1m74 and weights 64 kilograms. He brown hair and brown eyes and speaks Latin perfectly. He also has the letters “SPQR” tattoed on his left arm.
 Chief of Police, Roni Alsheich, says that the individual isn’t filed in any of Israel’s mental institutions and believes that he might be a foreigner.
 According to experts, it is not uncommon for schizophrenic individuals to have delusions that they are important historical or religious figures like Napoleon, Jesus or George Washington.
 However, patients suffering from this phenomenon called Grandiose delusion, rarely identify themselves with characters of secondary importance, making this case quite unique.
 Longinus is a mythical figure in Christianity described in Christian tradition as the Roman soldier who pierced Jesus in his side with a lance, the “Holy Lance” during the Crucifixion.
 His name isn’t clearly stated in the Bible, but the different Christian traditions have developed several stories around him.
 He is traditionally venerated as a saint and martyr by the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and several other Christian communions, even if very little is known about him.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/hindu-man-marries-a-rat-claiming-its-a-reincarnation-of-his-dead-wife/
"," Hindu man marries a rat, claiming it is the reincarnation of his dead wife"," 41-year old Chidhatma Basu lost his wife in a car accident in January 2017.
 The father of four young children says he was completely devastated for months, until one day, he made an unusual encounter.
 Mr. Basu says he rapidly understood that the rodent was the reincarnation of his deceased wife.
 He claims the animal was immediately affectionate, and even looked at him the same way that his wife did.
 Mr. Basu consulted temple officials about the mysterious animal and was assured that the rat was, indeed, his reincarnated wife.
 The Hindu priest who performed the ceremony says that Mr. Basu is extremely lucky to have found his dead wife again in her new form.
 While Hindus believe that it is possible for a human being to be reincarnated in animal form, weddings between humans and animals are extremely rare.
 This unusual ceremony ended up being very controversial and caused a lot of reactions in India.
 Many Hindu commentators defended Mr. Basu’s religious rights and saluted his “good karma”, while others criticized the ceremony, saying it gave India a negative image as a “backward country filled with zoophiles”.
 Some American and European organizations implicated in the defense of animal rights have also condemned the wedding.
 In a tweet published a few hours after the ceremony, PETA called the ceremony “disgusting and barbaric” and called for Mr. Basu to be jailed.
 Despite these critics, the wedding was entirely legal under Indian law, so Mr. Basu and his new “wife” aren’t likely to be bothered.
 too bad
 The first child must be at least seven. It is not clear if he discussed this subject with the child since he has the responsibility to bring up the children. The marriage itself is as crude and unnatural as that between lesbians and gays.
 What a disgrace…These people obviously have something missing..ive seen it before where they actually share food with rats that defficate over the food they were eating.they live in the stone age these hindus in india
 If it helps him cope and offer stability to his children them why not. People find solace from different things.

", Catholic priest hospitalized to have a crucifix removed from his rectum," Father Wendel O’Connor was rushed to the hospital after he called 911 to report that he had “fallen in the shower” and had a 10-inch long crucifix stuck in his anal cavity.
 The radiographs of his abdomen revealed that he, indeed, had a large religious symbol stuck in his rectum.
 Doctor James Shephard, who treated Father O’Connor, says he was shocked when he saw the x-ray pictures.
 After an extremely delicate 8 hour surgery, doctors were finally able to manually extract the crucifix.
 Dr Shephard says this particular Rectal Foreign Body Removal (RFBR) surgery was one of the most complex intervention he’s performed in his career.
 According to Doctor Shephard, the crucifix’s shape made its extraction particularly complicated.
 Father Wendel O’Connor refused to answer any questions, saying only that he had “an accident in the shower” and the “there was nothing sexual” in his situation.
 The priest’s case comes with a particular context which has drawn a lot of media attention to it, but it’s actually common for people to get object stuck in their rear ends.
 Every year, an average of 5 687 Americans show up at the hospital with various objects stuck in their anal cavities. Some of these cases have drawn a lot of media attention over recent years.
 In October 2016, a mother of one from Wallasey in England, was rushed to the hospital to have a large vibrator taken out of her rectum.
 In 2015, a 27-year-old unemployed American man went to the hospital with lower abdominal discomfort following an injection of a liquid adhesive in his anal cavity, five hours earlier.
 Other objects reportedly found in people’s anal cavities include light bulbs, bottles, cell phones, various animals and even a Buzz Lightyear figurine.

"," Syria: Kurdish fighters liberate 3,000 sheep held as sex slaves by ISIS"," The Peshmerga General Command (PGC) has announced this morning that their fighters had liberated three villages previously controlled by ISIS during a ground assault supported by U.S. air strikes.
 In one of the villages, they found an “animal brothel” operated by the terrorist group, in which nearly 4000 sheep and goats were used as sex slaves.
 PCG Commander, Col. Hemin Hassan, described the horrible conditions in which the animals were detained and abused.
 According to some civilians who were forced to work in the brothel, some animals were forced to engage in sexual intercourse with more than 100 ISIS fighters per day.
 The animals will now be transported inside Kurdish controlled regions of Syria and be distributed among families of dead Peshmerga fighters.
 The Peshmerga General Command held a press conference just outside the village before inviting the media to visit the alleged brothel.
 This isn’t the first time that the Islamic State is linked to bestiality, but it is the first official and operational “animal brothel” linked to the organization to be liberated.
 Other suspected animal brothels were found in the liberated cities of Raqqa and Palmyra, but the animals had already been taken to other cities by the Islamists.
 Animal Rights organizations estimate that 80,000 to 150,000 animals are currently used as sex slaves in ISIS operated brothels.
 The vast majority of these animals are sheep and goats, but some cases involving cows and chickens have also been reported.
 Those involved should of been shot onnthe spot, they worsevthan animals,

", Overweight German man who joined ISIS says they used him as sex slave," The young man, who had converted to Islam in 2014, had pledged allegiance to ISIS hoping to become a full-fledged soldier in its war against Western civilization.
 Instead, he was rapidly turned into a sex slave for ISIS combatants, spending most of his time in captivity chained to a bed, dressed up as a Western-style woman and performing sexual services on ISIS soldiers daily until his recent escape.
 “I went there to fight but I guess they had other plans for me,” he told reporters, visibly ashamed.
 “Upon my arrival, they kept pinching my ass, rubbing my nipples across my shirt and whistling at me,” he said.
 A picture of Hermann Gottlieb upon his arrival in Syria in 2015, days before he was literally transformed into an ISIS sex slave.
 Hermann Gottlieb, 28, says he was drugged the first week upon his arrival and woke up chained to a bed where he would spend most of his eighteen months of captivity.
 “They forced me to dress up with wigs, lipstick, and makeup all the time. One of the commanders had a fetish for Marilyn Monroe and would even make me watch movies of her so I would talk like her,” he told reporters.
 “They kept feeding me and feeding me, one soldier told me they wanted my breast to get bigger by overfeeding me,” he recalled in tears.
 “One commander told me I was doing Allah’s work and that ISIS soldiers respected me and appreciated my services and that I was more valuable to them chained to this bed than in the line of fire,” he told reporters.
 “Once, I must’ve sucked at least twenty dicks and got sodomized by maybe 40 guys in the same day after a major ISIS victory,” he recalled in horror.
 Hermann Gottlieb was released last month from his captivity by a high commander who had grown fond of him and eventually was able to reach the border of Iraq where he was eventually rescued by Iraqi forces and transferred to Germany where he is presently detained and under investigation.

", New Zealand farmer arrested for selling sheep as sex slaves to ISIS," Allan Seymour, 52, was sending an “intriguing large number” of livestock to Syria, destined to locations in Syria which are not controlled by the local government but are presently under the rule of ISIS forces, which alarmed CIA and MI6 officials monitoring the region.
 Although New Zealand Customs Services believed at first he was hiding weapons or explosives within the shipments, further investigations found no such evidence.
 Allan Seymour sold thousands of sheep to Syria to “satisfy ISIS soldiers sexual appetite” according to a joint CIA and MI6 report has admitted New Zealand’s Ministry of Defense
 According to political analyst and Middle Eastern expert Dave Wellsborough, the demand for livestock in the region is nothing new.
 “Islamic law permits to sleep with goats, sheep or other livestock as long as the animal is killed afterward, which explains the high numbers,” he adds.
 In a controversial interview last year, Dr. Zakir Naik – a noted Quranic scholar – explained why bestiality is permitted under certain conditions in Islam.
 According to New Zealand Customs services, over 20,000 sheep were shipped by Allan Seymour in the last year, but hundreds of thousands more could have been sent from other New Zealand farmers to ISIS forces which are presently unaccounted for.
 There is no such act been permitted in Al Quran and Islam. Refer to Al Quran before making any such claimed. PERIOD!!!

 “A man is still considered pure when he releases his lust with a sheep or goat. If there is no woman, then there is no true lust or sexual sin. Then the animal becomes tainted and so must die. So says the Prophet Mohammed”.

 Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.
 A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a patriot, and a traitor, for his revelations of thousands of classified documents.
 Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.
 The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.
 On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.

 “I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,”


 “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”

 “Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,”


 “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”

", Woman beats her Tinder date with a 16-inch dildo for refusing to perform oral sex on her," According to the police report, Latifah Smith found her victim, 29-year old Jamal Davidson through the social application Tinder, and the two decided to meet in a motel.
 Once on the site, things rapidly heated up and the two started making out and getting undressed.
 At some point during their sexual encounter, Ms. Smith asked her partner to perform oral sex on her, but he refused.
 The couple then got into a violent argument, and the 240-lbs woman totally lost it.
 Baltimore Police Department spokesman, Lt. T.J.Walters, described what happened next.
 According to Lieutenant Walters, she then used Mr. Davidson’s inanimate body to give herself an orgasm before calling 911.
 Mr. Davidson was finally transported to the John Hopkins Hospital, where his condition is considered “critical but stable”.
 Lieutenant T.J. Walters of the Baltimore Police Department says the accused beat her victim senseless with a 16-inch dildo before sexually abusing him while he was unconscious.
 Ms. Smith faces a total 17 criminal charges, including accusations of aggravated assaulted and rape.
 If found guilty on all charges, she could face a fine of $1,135,000 and a total of 115 years of imprisonment.
 Her lawyer, Mr. Roger Taylor, said her “sexually aggressive behavior” was caused by medication meant to increase her libido, and announced that the 43-year old woman would plead “not guilty”.
 Ms. Smith was freed on a $110,000 bail this morning and is expected to appear in court in August for the beginning of her trial.

  “She grabbed her dildo in her handbag and started beating him. She hit him at least 60 times and left him senseless.”
 

 
  “She admitted that she had used him as a sex toy while he was lying unconscious in his own blood. That 15-minute delay could have been fatal for the victim.”

", Colorado man claims he was held 2 weeks as a sex slave by a grizzly bear," According to 47-year Boris Madison, he was hiking alone in the woods near his residence when he was savagely attacked by a 900-lb brown bear.
 Mr. Madison said he feared for his life, but that the animal suddenly stopped hitting him and picked him up in its jaws.
 The bear carried him in a nearby cave and began his sexual assaults on the poor man.
 Boris Madison claims he was held captive in that cave for 16 days, and that the animal sexually assaulted him at least three times a day.
 He was finally able to get away when the sounds of gunshots from nearby hunters scared the animal away, allowing the poor man to flee from his prison.
 Mr. Madison was covered with lacerations and suffered from severe dehydration when he made it back to town last week and was rapidly transported to the hospital.
 Boris Madison says he feels lucky to be alive, even if the memories of his ordeal will haunt him for the rest of his life.
 Grizzly bear attacks are rather rare across North America, even if an average of two people are killed every year in such incidents.
 Most attacks result from a bear being surprised at a very close range, especially if in the case of female grizzlies protecting their offspring
 This is only the second reported case of a bear sexual assaulting a human.
 The first incident was reported in Montana in 2009 when two teenagers were assaulted in a similar manner by a young male grizzly bear.
 The animal was then hunted down and killed by Montana Wildlife agents.

  “It came out of nowhere and started running towards me. I tried to flee but it caught me and started beating me with its front paws.”
 

 “When he dropped me in the cave, I thought I was going to be devoured. But instead, it but pinned me face down with one of its paws and started scrubbing its genitals all over me.”

"," Hunter nearly killed by brutal sexual assault from 1,200 lbs moose"," Jeremy Larsen was hunting with his brother and his nephew near Dog Lake, in Ontario, when he accidentally spilled an entire jar of moose urine on himself. He decided to leave the group and head back to their cabin, three miles away, to change his clothes.
 He had about a mile left to walk when he was attacked by a male moose, weighing around 1200 lbs.
 Mr. Larsen tried to use his weapon to defend himself, but he was rapidly knocked out after receiving many kicks from the moose’s front hooves.
 While the poor man was lying on his knees, defenseless, the powerful animal began rubbing his massive genitals all over him, mimicking sexual intercourse.
 The severely injured hunter was found two hours later by his brother and nephew, who were also heading back to their cabin.
 John Larsen, the victim’s nephew, says his uncle was unconscious and covered in blood when they found him.
 Jeremy Larsen was transported by helicopter to a Toronto hospital, where doctors were able to stabilize his condition. He suffers from five broken ribs, a perforated lung, and 15 bone fractures, but doctors no longer fear for his life.
 Only hours after the attack, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry issued a warning concerning the use of moose urine. The ministry states that this is the third attack of this kind to occur in the province since 2011 and that all three were due to urine spills.
 I hope the moose wasn’t killed. All of these incidents were caused from spilled urine? Seems like they need to get a better container.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/saudi-arabia-famous-racehorse-to-be-executed-for-being-homosexual/
", Saudi Arabia: Famous racehorse to be executed for being homosexual," The 4-year old horse named Al-Hadiye (the Gift) is the property of the Saudi Prince, Alwaleed bin Talal. It earned more than 6 million USD during the last racing season alone, notably triumphing at the Saudi National Championship Show and the Qatar International Arabian Horse Show.
 The stallion was allegedly caught on two separate occasions by employees of the Prince’s corral, while it was engaged in sexual intercourse with another male. When this was reported to the authorities, the horse was rapidly taken away and isolated.
  “Homosexuality is a disease about which science knows very little,”
 said the President of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, Sheikh Abdulrahman Al Alsanad.
  “We have to protect the kingdom from this infection by every possible means at our disposition, and this also means protecting our animals. We will make any sacrifice necessary to protect the purity of the holy land.”
 The committee signed the famous horse’s death warrant in front of the television cameras. This was meant to send a clear message that homosexuality, under any form, would not be tolerated in the kingdom.
 Various organizations devoted to the rights of animals or homosexuals have denounced the committee’s decision and the constant persecution of gay animals in the kingdom.
 The American organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, better known under the abbreviation PETA, claims that the Saudi kingdom has one of the worst records in the world in terms of gay animal rights.
  “Every year, Saudi Arabia excutes between 25,000 and 35,000 animals because they are suspected of homosexuality,”
 explains the PETA spokeswoman, Janet McIntyre.
  “This includes many animals like dogs, cats, horses and camels, which are either stoned to death or decapitated, almost always in front of crowds. It is both cruel and barbaric, and such practices shouldn’t exist in the 21st century.”
 Almost a dozen American and European horse owners have also offered to buy the horse in order to prevent its execution, but so far, the kingdom has refused to negotiate. The execution is destined to take place on Friday, November 20.
 In Saudi Arabia, homosexuality is widely seen as an immoral and indecent activity, both for animals and humans. The kingdom’s law punishes acts of homosexuality or cross-dressing with imprisonment, fines, corporal punishment (like whipping or flogging) and even capital punishment.
 Combating homosexuality remains one of the major goals of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, along with its campaign against the consumption of alcohol and the practice of magic.
 What sickness and lunacy, the saudis should be ashamed.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/utah-remains-of-mysterious-creature-discovered-at-bear-lake/
", Utah: Remains of mysterious creature discovered at Bear Lake," The decomposed remains were found by a couple of locals who were walking on the lake’s shore. James and Christina Wilson noticed a foul smell while they were still hundreds of yards away and decided to investigate, leading to the discovery 25-foot (8 m) long carcass.
 The remains of the creature were partially emptied by the elements and scavengers, but still weigh more than two tons, suggesting the creature must have been enormous.
 A group of experts from the Utah Division of Wildlife Ressources, directed by Dr. Brian Upton, was rapidly dispatched on the site to inspect the creature.
 They told reporters the remains look somewhat similar to a crocodile or a mosasaur, an extinct group of large marine reptiles, but more tests and analysis are necessary to determine the true nature of the creature.
 Dr. Upton says the remains are very similar to a type of Aigialosaurus, a subtype of the mesosaur family of marine reptiles that lived during the Cretaceous period.
 The discovery of this gigantic creature in Bear Lake could finally bring an explanation to almost 150 years of alleged attacks and sightings in the region.
 The myth of the “Bear Lake Monster” originally grew from articles written in the 19th century by Joseph C. Rich, a Mormon colonizer in the area, purporting to report second-hand accounts of sightings of the creature.
 In an 1868 article in the Deseret News, he announced that
  “The Indians have a tradition concerning a strange, serpent-like creature inhabiting the waters of Bear Lake…. Now, it seems this water devil, as the Indians called it, has again made an appearance. A number of our white settlers declare they have seen it with their own eyes. This Bear Lake Monster, they now call it, is causing a great deal of excitement up here”
 before going on to relate several sightings of the creature in recent times.
 The article created a stir in Salt Lake City and within a month
  “a news staff member… quizzed many Bear Lake people and found hardly a person who doubted it.”
 A 1907 letter published in a Logan, Utah newspaper claimed that two men had seen the Bear Lake behemoth attack their camp and kill one of their horses. A 4-year-old also claimed to have seen it in 1937, and a boy scout leader spoke of seeing it in 1946.
 In recent years the monster was mostly considered to be a tourist attraction, and the last reported sighting of the monster was in June 2002, when Bear Lake business owner, Brian Hirsch, claims to have seen the monster.
 The original comments on this article were in February of 2016.

  We walk here almost every day, but we have never seen anything like this,”
 


 “We could smell the stench from almost a mile away, and we knew that there was something wrong. When we finally found the corpse, we couldn’t believe our eyes. It’s really huge and it almost looks like a rotting dinosaur. That’s not a kind of creature that I ever expected to find in Utah!”

 “It seems obvious that this creature was some kind of large marine predator, but the exact nature of the animal as yet to be determined,”


 “It definitely looks like a lot like a crocodile, but as few distinct features which suggest that it could be another type of aquatic reptile. The creature’s jaw seems very similar to various types of mosasaur, some aquatic reptiles which used to live in many American lakes.”

", Moon Astronaut Admits on Deathbed: “Obama Could Be Alien”," One of America’s last living space pioneers and one of its most respected astronaut’s has given up his last breath yesterday at Chicago St-Church Hospital.
 During the 4-hour long operation, a lung was punctured and complications led the famous astronaut to his untimely death.
 Before he died, the astronaut made revelations about alleged top classified information that shocked his family, friends and the whole NASA community.
  “He was being operated for a tumor in his lung, but the operation was too much for the old man” explained Brett Thompson, his only son.
  “He wouldn’t take any painkillers, he wanted to stay awake during the whole operation” he recalls.
  “He grabbed me by the hand and held my ear next to his mouth,” his son told reporters.
  “He then told me all about how Obama was not human, but a hybrid being: half-human, half-alien” he explains, still visibly under the shock of such a revelation.
 Strangely enough, it is not the first time a high ranking official has accused Obama of possibly being an alien.
 Iranian general Amir Khadiff had also claimed a similar story since Barack Obama’s election in 2008.

", Aquarium employee emasculated after sexual assault on octopus," The 28-year-old employee was found partially naked and unconscious when security agents discovered the young man and alerted an ambulance.
 It took medical personnel several hours to successfully release the octopus that had latched itself to the man’s genital area.
 “We did the best we could but the octopus’s beak has tremendous pressure and the animal had started to digest part of the man’s genitals,” explained Dr. Julia Andrews of the San Diego Medical Center.
 “We also opened the stomach of the octopus only to find the partial remains of a digested testicle,” she told reporters.
 Octopus beaks can exert pressure up to 2,300 pounds per square inch (psi), over twice as much as a hyena, lion or tiger.
 Although the young man is still lying in critical condition, health officials do not worry for his life.
 “He has lost a lot of blood but it’s a good thing he got here on time,” explained his father to reporters.
 “I don’t know what the hell he was thinking screwing with that sea critter but with a little reconstructive surgery, the doctor said he’ll be as good as new,” his father said, visibly relieved.
 A San Diego Zoo spokesman told reporters that the “incident was tragic and deplorable” and that an investigation would take place to ensure that “similar incidents do not occur again.”
 He nearly lost his penis because he thought an octopus would be able to do it for him. WHAT. THE. FOCK.
 He won’t have the balls to do that again.
 Good gods what is this horny, sexually ungratified world coming to? This guy will always be deformed and monstrous—because he had to stick it in anything he thought would ‘do the job’… Yeah, he’s that guy who would attempt to screw a hole in the wall.

 “Why is there no warning that a women’s hymen can be broken when the tampon is inserted into the vaginal region? This is the question we ask” explained Ben Ali Mufta, the family attorney.
 “This is a tragedy that could have been easily prevented had the company taken its responsibilities,” he acknowledged yesterday.

 Although the breaking of the hymen is usually believed to occur during a first sexual contact, t
  he hymen of a woman may be broken in many ways: Injury, accident, playing sports, riding a bicycle, penetration of any sort such as a medical examination, use of tampons, or a douche, admit experts.
 Time for an honor killing. They can’t sell her for 5 goats to the neighbor now. But removing the hymen is TOTALLY OK with these savages…..
 I was 11 and a virgin and yes I had to have a tampon manually ripped out, the pain was immence and I am convinced I had my hymen ripped… this does not make a person however a none virgin….. a virgin is a person who has not experienced sex, not a person with a damaged hymen… a hymen can be broken via gymnastics, horse riding, cycling, running and other activities… some people need teaching.
 Let’s compromise. I personally thought they’d understand from instructions what would happen. Are you positive it was the tampon, could it have been a family member and you’re covering it up. As for the kid, no worries, I’m sure you’ll find a 6000 Yr old man to sell her to.
 tell the muslim fk her hubby did that when she was a lil girl
 They better not win the suit against the tampon makers. They broke their own law first anyways. Don’t blame someone else for your own screw up. ….”who will want her now?” Let the girl be adopted by a more fair and civilized family, raised in the current century. Then a loving spouse will come along eventually.

", McDonald’s employee accused of smuggling 80 lbs of McNuggets in his anal cavity," 31-year old Andy Brown was arrested this morning by the Ottawa Police after a cavity search revealed four condoms filled with frozen chicken nuggets hidden in his rectum.
 According to McDonald’s spokesman David Knoxx, Mr. Brown’s employer had suspected him of stealing food for some time and had already searched him on five occasions, but they never seemed to find anything on him.
 A search of Mr. Brown’s locker revealed a large jar of Vaseline and dozens of unused condoms.
 Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau says that the investigation showed Mr. Brown had already stolen at least 80 to 100 lbs of McNuggets over the last few months.
 Mr. Brown now faces five charges of petty theft and two charges of possession of stolen property, after allegedly stealing more than 80 lbs of McNuggets between the month of December 2015 and September 2016.
 Investigators posited that he used a little ingenuity and some Vaseline, inserting the nuggets in condoms and hiding them in his anal cavity to smuggle them out of his workplace.
 He has been released on a promise to appear in court on October 12 for the beginning of his trial.
 How do you fit those chicken nuggets in his butt I can barely fit my boyfriend’s dick in my butt
 He could have asked his employer for any food they are going to throw away and usually the managers have a heart because they know you are struggling….. and the food is going to go in the trash anyway right…..or volunteer to be the one to take care of trash and get the food out yourself…. don’t just steal it!!!!

 The officers reported he had been driving erratically and suspected him of being under the influence of alcohol.
 During a press conference this morning, Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams described the unusual scene that took place when Mr Murphy was asked to use the breathalyzer.
 According to Chief Williams, the 44-year old electrician ate the device on purpose to avoid being accused of DUI.
 Unfortunately for him, Mr Murphy’s plan didn’t go quite as planned and he was immediately arrested.
 A blood test was finally done at the police station and revealed he had a blood alcohol content of 0.46%, more than five times the allowed limit.
 The Cleveland police chief warned that eating or destroying a breathalyzer is a crime in the United States and shouldn’t be attempted.
 George Murphy now faces a total of nine criminal charges, including driving under the influence of alcohol, refusal to take a preliminary breath test and hindering police officers in the execution of their duties.
 The 44-year old has already been convicted twice for DUI in 2004 and 2013 and had only recently recovered the right to drive.
 If found guilty on all charges, he could spend up to five years in jail and have his driver’s license revoked for ten years.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/irish-farmer-claims-he-was-sexually-assaulted-by-a-leprechaun/
", Irish farmer claims he was sexually assaulted by a leprechaun," In an exclusive interview broadcasted this morning on RTÉ, Angus Brennan from Watergrasshill, near Cork, says he was milking his cows on Saturday when he was hit on the head from behind with a shovel or similar tool.
 The attack knocked him out, and when he woke up a few hours later, he had been tied up to a support beam inside his own barn.
 The 54-year old farmer says he was repeatedly raped over the next 40 hours by a “waist-high midget with a red beard and a cocked hat”.
 According to Mr. Brennan, the “leprechaun” raped him more than 20 times over the weekend before leaving for some unknown reason.
 Gardaí officers and paramedics arrived on the site within minutes and found Mr. Brennan lying in a pool of his own blood.
 He was transported to the Bon Secours Hospital in Cork where doctors observed “obvious signs of a violent sexual aggression”.
 Gardai Commissioner Noirin O’Sullivan confirmed that the national police force had opened an investigation, but insisted that investigators were, at the moment, looking for “human” suspects.
 According to the police, the suspect could be a bearded, red-headed midget measuring around 80 centimeters tall.
 It’s rather improbable that the rapist turns out to be a Leprechaun, a type of fairy in Irish folklore usually depicted as little bearded men who partake in mischief.
 Even so, a surprisingly high number of leprechaun sightings and even a few other attacks have reported over recent years across the United Kingdom, and even in the United States.
 In April 2015, a Welsh man reported being assaulted and robbed by a pair of “evil-looking leprechauns” armed with knives.
 In June 2012, in Seattle, a man who was found covered in blood outside a bar reported being assaulted by “a bunch of leprechauns”.
 In 2006, a leprechaun sighting in Mobile drew large crowds and even forced police intervention.
 In all cases, the leprechauns have yet to be apprehended.

"," Man locked inside a supermarket for a night eats $8,000 worth of food"," 47-year old Liam Norris claims he had to use the store’s bathroom a few minutes before closing time and incidentally escaped the notice of the employees closing up shop for the night.
 Once he came out of the washroom, the lights were out and the staff was gone.
 Mr. Norris claims he panicked when he realized that he had left his cell phone in his car, so he started binge eating and wreaking havoc among the aisles.
 In the hours before he was discovered by staff clocking on for their early morning shift, he managed to work his way through thousands of dollars worth of food.
 This morning, the aisles of the supermarket were so full of empty food packages and other trash that it looked like it had been hit by a tornado.
 According to the store manager, he also drank a total 17 cans of cola, 2 gallons of orange juice, 5 cans of energy drink and one and a half gallon of maple syrup, a ridiculous quantity of liquid for a man who was locked up only in eight hours.
 Mr. Norris admits that he ingested large amounts of food, but claims it was only due to nervosity.
 Despite Mr. Norris’ explanations, many people are questioning his version of the events and suggest he might have planned the incident.
 A spokesman for the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that an investigation had been launched in order to determine if Mr. Norris was indeed, a victim of the supermarket employees’ negligence, or if he intentionally hid inside the store.
 Fayette County assistant Sheriff, Mark Taylor, confirmed to reporters that an investigation was underway to determine if criminal accusations could be filed against Mr. Norris.
 Every year, dozens of Americans get locked up in stores at night under various circumstances.
 While most are rapidly able to communicate with someone outside the store and are released, a few end up being stuck for long time periods.
 In 2016, a 71-year old customer was stuck in a bakery for 3 days while the shop closed for a few days at Christmas.
 In most cases, customers were not charged for the goods that they ingested while imprisoned, but some stores have made notable exceptions for customers who were considered to have exaggerated.
 Do these stores not have phones in them so the call to the police will be coming from INSIDE THE STORE!!!! 🤔

  “When I’m nervous, I tend to eat. When I noticed I was stuck inside the store, I went crazy and couldn’t do anything but stuff myself with food.”
 

 “I was alone in the dark and I was afraid. I started eating so I wouldn’t think about the fact that I was imprisoned, and I kept going until I was freed.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/woman-with-chronic-premenstrual-syndrome-suspected-of-189-murders/
", Woman with chronic premenstrual syndrome suspected of 189 murders," The investigators suspect 39-year old Loretta Jones, who suffers from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as well Chronic Hormone Disorder, of killing 189 people between 1993 and 2017, in both the United States and Mexico.
 According to the FBI spokesman, Bill Davidson, her medical condition makes her extremely dangerous to anyone who crosses her path.
 Mr. Davidson says the accused severely bit a federal agent while in detention and assaulted two others.
 Ms. Jones worked as a debt collector for a large financial company and traveled a lot, across California and bordering states as well as Northern Mexico.
 The investigators have so far been able to link her to 137 murders in the state of California, 16 in Oregon, 11 in Arizona, 8 in Nevada and 17 in Mexico.
 The FBI spokesman, Bill Davidson, claims she is probably the most dangerous individual he has ever met in his 24-year as a federal agent.
 Dr. Alonso Franco Gonzales of the Californian Institute for Mental Health as seen only one similar case in his career insists that this kind of disorder is extremely rare.
 He insists that Ms. Jones’ case has nothing to do with a regular premenstrual syndrome and is something completely different.
 According to Dr. Gonzales, there is little knowledge about such cases because they are very rare and because woman suffering from similar disorders are still burned as witches in many countries, even today.
 He believes that Ms. Jones cannot be held responsible for her actions because she is mentally unstable, but insists that she should remain in detention for the rest of her life in a psychiatric hospital.
 No charges have been filed yet against the Californian woman, but the FBI says it’s “
  only a matter of days
 ” before she is officially accused.
 In addition to PMDD this woman is also suffering from Bipolar Disorder with violence component. She should be restrained in a criminally insane institution
 She is simply demon possessed! There’s no mental health issue here and you can’t blame it on a pre-menstrual syndrome. Just look at her face. Demons are alive and well these days and everyone who is flipping out and doing something is not mentally ill. They are demon possessed literally!
 I don’t think we read the same article. This specifically said it was NOT pre-Menstrual Syndrome…
 Also, you can’t blame things on demons considering they do not exist.
 Does this mean she will stop killing when she hits menopause? Does this excuse the next 10 years of murder and when she hits 50 the urge will be gone? Do you think a little hormonal balance might help?
 What Pretty Eyes……….and BIG TOO!

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/yemen-court-rules-teenager-has-to-marry-impregnated-camel/
", Yemen: Court Rules Teenager Has to Marry Impregnated Camel," The young boy admitted to having repeatedly mated with the animal during the course of the last year when he developed an “uncontrollable urge” to do so and felt obliged to come out publicly and admit to his crime after the camel gave birth and the young boy believed he was the father.
 “Although we do not believe he is the father of the young calf, to punish him of his evil ways and purge him of his demons, we the council of elders ask that the young boy be married to the camel,” said the village spokesman, as recounted by eyewitness testimonies.
 To rid the young boy of evil Jinns (spirits) and teach him a lesson, the court of elders forced the young boy to marry the camel who recently gave birth, explained to reporters Mohammed Mulak, the village spokesman
 Although the young man has received a punishment that has shamed him and his family, friends and family members report that the young man is satisfied with the verdict.
 “He is very ashamed of his wrong doings but is very relieved to have learned that he is not the father of the calf,” his aunt told local reporters. “He says he felt he was not ready for such responsibilities and is very glad to put this behind him,” she told reporters.
 The local imam claims the young boy has been possessed by evil spirits and the marriage with the animal should ward off the bad omen brought by the insidious act.
 “It is necessary to cleanse this young boy of his evil actions and the marriage should protect him from evil Jinns (spirits) and bring forth Allah’s protection within this weak boy’s soul,” he explained. “May Allah protect him and his family,” he added.
 According to Sharia or Islamic law, the camel is set to be put to death and the young man’s family is to pay for its replacement, has proclaimed the elderly court.
 Just … NASTY.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/florida-man-suffocated-to-death-after-having-sex-with-pet-anaconda/
", Florida: Man suffocated to death after having sex with pet anaconda," It took several hours for authorities to separate the large serpent from the young man as the victim was in “full erection” and had “deeply penetrated” the female anaconda’s genitalia according to the coroner’s report.
 David Brown, 22, was found naked and completely enveloped by his pet anaconda by a friend when he contacted authorities, hoping they could save his life.
 “I knew he was into bestiality and erotic asphyxiation but I never thought it would go so wrong,” explained his friend in tears to reporters.
 Brown had several pets with which he openly admitted to “having sex with” according to his best friend, Tyler Johnson
 The young man that was an avid animal fan had a wide collection of pets ranging from dogs and cats to tarantulas, snakes, scorpions, turtles and even a baby wild hog he described himself as “extremely horny.”
 “He’s loved animals since he was a young boy,” said his mother.
 “I wasn’t too fond of that big snake but he reassured me he’d take care of it and that it wasn’t dangerous,” she said, exploding in tears.
  David Brown was also brought to the emergency room last October after an incident with a pet gerbil who had “accidentally perforated his anus and chewed through his intestinal track,” explained another family friend.
  The young man had suffered severe internal bleeding and necessitated surgery but was up and running again two months later.
  “I thought he had learned his lesson from that previous incident but he definitely did not” explained one of his former girlfriends who wished to remain anonymous.
 Although the state of Florida has officially outlawed bestiality in October 2011, the bestiality law does not forbid oral sex between a human and an animal, and only forbids “penetration” of a human sex organ into an animal’s mouth according to legal experts.
 I can’t even convince my wife to try a threesome with a human friend. This dude had it all.

 “He always told me he wasn’t hurting anybody and that animals loved sex as much as humans, that it was a consensual thing. Who am I to judge?” he added.

 “He once convinced me into a threesome with his German Shepherd but I wouldn’t get close to that snake, even if David proposed it several times and was really persuasive,” she remembers.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/woman-rolls-over-hairdresser-with-her-car-after-he-ruined-her-hair/
", Woman rolls over hairdresser with her car after he “ruined” her hair," According to the Chicago Police Department, Cassandra Gilmore, from Oak Lawn in Illinois, had her hair cut this morning at Luigi’s Beauty Palace in downtown Chicago, by the famous stylist Francesco Moreno.
 After seeing the results in a mirror, she suddenly became hysterical and tried to assault Mr. Moreno with a curling iron.
 Two customers of the establishment rapidly intervened to help the stylist. Fighting desperately, they were able to stop the woman and kick her out of the store.
 Ms. Gilmore was still determined to get her vengeance, however, and she waited more than four hours in a nearby parking lot for the victim to leave his workplace.
 When Mr. Moreno exited from the beauty salon around 2:15 PM, she charged him with her car and ran him over at more than 50 miles per hour.
 According to Roseanne Taylor, who works with Francesco Moreno and witnessed the attack, Ms. Gilmore drove back and forth over him at least 7 times.
 Several witnesses rapidly called the police, and the first officers arrived on the site less than two minutes later. They immediately arrested the 18-year old woman and called an ambulance on the site.
 Mr. Moreno was transported to the Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, where doctors were able to stabilize him.
 He suffers from severe internal bleeding, a perforated lung, two skull fractures, eight broken ribs and 21 other bone fractures, but doctors no longer fear for his life.
 The Chicago Police Superintendent, Eddie Johnson, described the aggression as “one the most vicious” he has seen in his career.
 Cassandra Gilmore confessed to intentionally attacking Mr. Moreno, saying she wanted revenge after he “ruined her life” with his “botched haircut”.
 She allegedly explained that her prom night is only a month away and that she was under a lot of stress to make this “most important night of her life” perfect.
 The young woman will most likely miss her prom after all, as she now faces a total of 29 criminal charges, including attempted murder, using a vehicle as a weapon and dangerous driving.
 She could face up to 75 years in prison and is expected to appear in court in June.
 Wait, sounds like she flipped her wig!!!

"," Plane accidentally empties toilet tank over cruise ship, 23 injured"," A Boeing 777 airplane belonging to the Taiwanese airline EVA Air, dumped human excreta midair while traveling from Japan to Hawaii.
 Unfortunately, the content of the toilet tank was jettisoned into the sky while the plane was flying over the cruise liner
  Lady of the Pacific
 , which was hit by “large chunks of blue ice”.
 The top deck of the ship was literally covered with chunks of blue ice containing human excreta.
 Hundreds of passengers were standing on the top deck at the time, and many were hit by ice projectiles weighing up to 10 lbs.
 Janis Garrison, a passenger who witnessed the whole incident, says the ice appeared very suddenly and took everyone by surprise.
 Five passengers were critically injured and 18 more were severely hurt, but the ship’s medical staff intervened rapidly and was able to stabilize all of the victims.
 The ship was rapidly redirected to Hawaii to undergo some repair and to allow the injured passengers to obtain better medical care.
 Some of them could need weeks of care before they can go back to their regular life.
 25-year old Jason Matthews was hit by a 12-lb chunk of ice and suffered a severe concussion. He still has no memory of the incident.
 North Pacific Cruise Lines, who own and operate the
  Lady of the Pacific
 , confirmed they would file a lawsuit against the Taiwanese airline.
 According to international law, dumping of lavatory waste is illegal, so EVA Air could also face some major fines.
 Despite regulations, many Asian airliners continue to jettison the content their toilet tanks over the Pacific Ocean, and even over land.
 In December 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) of India ordered a fine of Rs. 50,000 on airlines emptying toilet tanks in the air, after a Delhi neighborhood was repeatedly hit by blue ice.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/a-woman-can-go-to-heaven-as-long-as-shes-accompanied-by-a-male-relative-claims-saudi-imam/
"," “A woman can go to Heaven, as long as she’s accompanied by a male relative” claims Saudi Imam"," In a sermon he delivered at the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina last Friday, the progressive Imam She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair declared that women can be admitted into heaven, as long as they are accompanied by “Mahram relatives” (male kin, who is not suitable for marriage under Islamic law).
 This surprising declaration is in complete rupture with the country’s traditional hard line, which states that woman can never be admitted into Heaven, under any circumstances.
 She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair confirmed his position yesterday, during a panel of discussion on the role of women in Islamic society. He declared that he was convinced that “more than a few” Muslim women who were “good wives and good mothers”, have already been admitted into Heaven.
 A group of conservative scholars and religious leaders from across Saudi Arabia, overseen by the country’s ministry of Islamic Affairs, signed a declaration condemning the Imam’s sermon as a blasphemy, and reaffirming that “only men are worthy of going to Heaven”.
 The scholars said that many deviant groups and individuals over the centuries have been responsible for the spreading such false beliefs, which are not part of the teaching of Islam. They advised all Muslims to “keep away from all the rituals and beliefs which are unIslamic”.
 Minister of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, Call and Guidance, Sheikh Saleh al-Sheikh told the al-Watan newspaper that Sheikh Al-Budair would be allowed to continue preaching, but will now be closely watched.
 The simple fact that the progressive Imam wasn’t arrested, suggests that some influential members of the Royal family may have secretly come to his defense.
 Rumors have already begun to spread, relayed by the Saudi media, that Princess Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan, the King’s second wife and mother of the Crown Prince Mohammed, could have used her influence to keep the religious leader from being arrested.
 The controversy has drawn reactions from various groups in the region, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who promised to kill the Imam if he doesn’t withdraw his declaration.
 She‎ikh Salah Al-Budair is expected to preach again at the Prophet’s Mosque next Friday, and his sermon promises to draw a lot of attention from both the media and the religious authorities.

 The young waitress says she was shocked to find out that the mother of the children was a customer she had served during her entire shift.
 Sarah Ferguson decided to call the police after noticing the children in the car both before and after her 8-hour shift.
 The single mother of four will now face four charges of child abandonment and four charges of child neglect.
 If found guilty on all charges, Ms. Hernandez could lose custody of her children and spend up to 20 years in prison.
 She was freed from jail this morning on a $12,500 bail, but her children will remain under the care of social services until the end of her trial.

", Canada: Moose Escapes from Zoo and Goes on Cow-Raping Rampage," A number of local farmers in the area have warned authorities about a moose that has been seen on many occasions “humping” their cattle and possibly harming the animals.
  – Thomas O’Neill, local farmer
 Thomas O’Neill, a local farmer, contacted local authorities when he found the 2,000-pound moose “shagging” his cattle before it fled into the bush moments later
 The local farmer says he was first alarmed by the distress calls he was hearing from his cattle.
 “Never in a hundred years did I ever think I would see that with my own eyes” he added, visibly shocked by the scene.
 Although it is not known if the sex acts were consensual or perceived as an act of aggression by the cows themselves, the act of mating for the moose is a rather normal thing, explains veterinarian Annie Beaudoin, of the Calgary Zoo.
 “This 3-year-old moose has been raised in captivity and due to its particularly aggressive nature was enclosed by itself for most of its life. It is the first occasion that it has had in its entire life to experiment with a sexual partner,” she told reporters.
 After a 48-hour wild goose chase, Wildlife agents still have not successfully apprehended the animal and all persons having information concerning its whereabouts should contact the Alberta Environment and Parks, Fish &amp; Wildlife department.
 Wild goose chase? Why not Wild moose chase?

", Woman accused of stealing a pumpkin by hiding it in her vagina," 31-year old Sonia Smith was intercepted by security guards from a Supervalu store after they saw her enter the store’s bathroom with the pumpkin and come out with it.
 The security guards first thought Mr. Smith had either eaten the pumpkin or flushed it down the toilet, but they soon noticed that she was sweating heavily and looked very uncomfortable.
 James Reynolds, one of the security guards who intercepted Ms. Smith says he was in disbelief when he understood where she had put it.
 The two security guards called the Greenville Police Department who rapidly proceeded to a cavity search and discovered the pumpkin.
 Mr. Reynolds says the officers dispatched on the site thought they were being pranked when they first explained the situation.
 The squash showed extremely difficult to extract and the 31-year old woman had to be transported to the hospital, where it was finally removed after a delicate two-hour surgery.
 The security guard who intercepted the pumpkin thief described the incident as “extremely disturbing” and the worst thing he’s seen since he started doing this job 13 years ago.
 Sonia Smith now faces two charges of shoplifting and disorderly conduct, but she could be judged unfit to stand trial due to her long history of psychiatric problems.
 The young woman has already made several stays in mental institutions across the state since 2009.
 A source close to her family has confirmed that she suffers from schizophrenia and “hears voices that command her to insert various objects in her body cavities”.
 The result of her psychiatric evaluation should be available in two or three weeks and the result will determine if the trial will take place or not.
 Damn all she had to do was roll up a layer of fat put in and walk out no one would know because she is hefty bag big.
 coo coo coo who was at fault for letting her out in the first place

", Florida: Babysitter tied crying one-month-old baby to ceiling fan for 26 hours," Nora Jackson, 28, was contacted and hired on Craigslist to take care of a one-month-old baby after the parents had planned to take a day off.
 Parents of the one-month-old child contacted the Orlando Police Department when they arrived at their residence to find their baby had been tied and suspended from the ceiling fan.
 Camera surveillance footage contradicted Nora Jackson’s story that she had only suspended the child to the ceiling fan for a few minutes, but instead for 26 hours straight, commented Deputy Sheriff Neil James.
 Although the child is currently under medical watch, doctors believe the baby will not suffer from any permanent damage.
 Nora Jackson finally admitted that she was intoxicated and under the influence of crystal meth, alcohol and crack cocaine before she decided to suspend the one-month-old baby to the ceiling fan to stop him from crying.
 Jackson also left the home during the night to attend a party elsewhere and lost the keys and address to the house where she had left the baby.
 Orlando police later arrested Jackson at her home where she first denied being hired on Craigslist as a babysitter but later admitted to the whole story.
 Jackson is now facing multiple accounts of child abuse and neglect and could face up to 15 years in jail if convicted.
 Why the hell would anyone hire someone from Craig list to watch their newborn. The parents need to be checked out, too

 Anna Krutchiev, the 16-year-old babysitter, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became exceedingly hungry and eventually lost consciousness.
 “I just took a few tokes because I was bored and wanted to stay awake,” she told Officer Johnson.
  “All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out” she admitted in tears.
 The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfield’s Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life.
  “It appears she tried to cook him in the microwave oven but apparently she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later,” explained Sheriff deputy James Anderson of the Jefferson County Police Department.
 “Teeth marks were found on the baby’s arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed” he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair.
  The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts.
  A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for
   medical use in treatment

 If she is 16 years old hate to see what she will look like at 50 damn drugs are making her look old.I think age mess up here.

", Two CIA Agents Arrested by Minutemen while Crossing Mexican Border with 1300 Pounds of Cocaine," The volunteers were completely astonished when the two arrestees pulled out CIA ID cards and explained they were actually carrying the drug as part of their duties and that the cargo belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The incident took place last night, in the Chihuahuan desert, near the Texan city of El Paso.
 A group of seven Minutemen saw a large black SUV drive rapidly across the border. They chased the vehicle in their own trucks and achieved to immobilize it after a chase of more than 15 miles.
 The vigilantes arrested the two men on board and called the border patrol, who proceeded to search the vehicle. They discovered dozens of packages of cocaine, totaling an incredible 618.4 kilograms (1363 pounds).
 The search of the vehicle revealed 36 packages of cocaine, all marked with the symbol of the Sinaloa Cartel, representing a black scorpion.
 The two men claim to be CIA operatives based in Mexico and explained that the drug was actually part of an operation of the agency.
 They presented identity cards that seem to validate their claim, but the CIA spokesperson, Dean Boyd, has officially denied any link between the organization and the two men.
 Both the border patrol officers and minutemen seem unconvinced, however, and many of them seem to believe that the secret service agency is hiding something.
 The U.S. custom services have even announced a thorough investigation to try and verify the two men’s story.
 The custom services have confirmed that the two men, who can’t be identified due to the Intelligence Identities and Protection Act of 1982, did carry valid CIA identifications and that the vehicle was indeed registered as a service vehicle of the organization.
 The two men remain under the custody of the customs services at the moment and are still being interrogated in a facility near El Paso.
 They are facing charges of possessing, trafficking and importing illegal drugs, and could face other criminal charges once the investigation is over.
 Both the FBI and the DEA have announced that they would collaborate with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in this case, which as already attracted a lot of attention in Southern Texas.
 So the CIA is smuggling drugs AGAIN, what’s new this is how they get their Special Op budget they have been doing this for decades – Tom Cruise even starred in a movie about the CIA’s drug smuggling operation.

 “The CIA doesn’t take part in drug smuggling operations at the US-Mexican border”


 “I do not know, for now, if the men are actually affiliated to the agency in any way, but I can tell you the cocaine doesn’t belong to the CIA.”

 “Both of them had valid accreditations and a receipt for their cargo”


 “What drug dealer in his right mind, demands a receipt for 1300 pounds of cocaine? There is really something strange about these guys, and we believe the CIA possibly knows more than what it is ready to admit.”

", Drug mule arrested after diarrhea ejects cocaine in middle of airport," 27-year old Tania Smith, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, was getting ready to board a plane back to the United States after spending two weeks in Brazil when the incident occurred.
 The young woman looked visibly ill and feverish while waiting in line before boarding, and several witnesses said kept groaning and swearing loudly.
 At the moment she was called up to present her ticket, she suffered a severe incident of diarrhea which ejected dozens of drugs pellets from her rectum, directly on the airport floor.
 Ms. Smith was immediately arrested and a cavity search revealed more drug packages, bringing the total to 104 pellets.
 An examination of the pellets indicated she had over 1kg in weight of cocaine in her body, for a street value of more than $100,000.
 She confessed that he had been offered a 2-week trip in Brazil by a man in Florida in exchange for bringing the cocaine back from Rio de Janeiro to Miami.
 According to the Lieutenant Igor Rosario di Pablo of the Brazilian federal police, she suffered from Traveler’s diarrhea during her entire trip and was still sick when she inserted the drugs in her anal cavity.
 Lieutenant Di Pablo and police director Rosario Perreira Franco described this arrest as one of the easiest and most scatty of their careers but insisted that drug smuggling was a very serious problem and nothing to laugh about.
 Tania Smith was charged with drug transportation and trafficking. She faces from 30 years to life in jail if convicted.
 Dozens of individuals like her are arrested every year while smuggling drugs across borders for drug cartels.
 These “drug mules” often use body cavities to hide the drugs, and some die every year after the packages break and release the drugs in their bodies.
 Considering the risks associated with this process, Ms. Smith’s severe diarrhea may have gotten her arrested, but it might also have saved her life.
 Shoulda been wearing Depends.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/teacher-arrested-for-stapling-a-loudmouth-students-lips-shut/
", Teacher arrested for stapling a “loudmouth” student’s lips shut," According to witnesses at the Central High School, Dorothy Fransen was furious after one of her students, 17-year old Jeremy Dunlop, kept interrupting her class and making jokes about her physical appearance.
 She reportedly tackled the young man and held him on the ground while stapling his lips more than 45 times.
 Amanda Jones, one of the victim’s classmates who witnessed the whole incident, says that the teacher “completely lost it” after the young man made a joke about her weight.
 Another witness, Justin Reynolds, says he tried to help his classmate, but was kicked by the infuriated teacher.
 Fortunately, two officers of the Springfield Missouri Police Department were already on the site and Ms Fransen was arrested less than five minutes after the beginning of the assault.
 A dozen police officers were mobilized to Central High School after the incident in order to collect the testimonies of the numerous witnesses.
 Ms Fransen now faces a total of 21 criminal charges, including 5 charges of aggravated assault, and could now face up to 110 years in jail.
 Her lawyer, Robert Monroe, says that her violent reaction was due to the fact that she was being harassed by Mr Dunlop on a regular basis.
 Mr Monroe claims that Ms Fransen is in fact the victim in this story, and that she “temporarily lost contact with reality” as a result of the harassment.
 She is expected to appear in court in May, but her lawyer has already announced that she would plea “not guilty”.
 ugly whore poor boy I would sue her
 she is so ugly

 “She was just enraged! She yelled ‘This will shut you up, you little fucker!’ and just jumped on him. She held him down and then she began stapling his lips over and over again.”

 “I tried to pull her off Jeremy and the first time she violently pushed me away. When I tried again, she kicked me in the guts with her high heels.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/new-york-chinese-immigrant-sold-hot-dogs-made-with-real-dog-meat/
", New York: Chinese immigrant sold hot dogs made with real dog meat," NYC food inspectors were anonymously tipped on Chow’s operation which possibly involved recuperating dead dogs in dumpsters of the Animal Care Centers all over the city report officials.
 Sixteen other family members are also under investigation as they were currently volunteering in nine different Animal Care Centers in the New York City area and suburbs have confirmed authorities.
 Chow’s lawyer, Justin Wang, told reporters that he was currently not aware of any concrete evidence that his client, who has been charged with animal cruelty, had sold dog meat but that if he had, it was only a cultural misunderstanding, he argued.
 Chow’s wife, Hu-Wen Zhao, believes the owner of the hot dog stand on the other side of the street has conspired against her husband to shut down his business.
 Killing dogs and cats for meat is still legal in 44 U.S. states but in the state of New York it is expressly prohibited for “any person to slaughter or butcher domesticated dogs or domesticated cats to create food, meat or meat products for human or animal consumption.”
 Xi Ping Chow immigrated to the United States in 1996 and has had a hot dog stand license in the Brooklyn area for the past 18 years. Some experts estimate he could have sold over a million of his hot dogs to date.
 He better stay locked up because if the people in Brooklyn find out he sold them dog meat, he will be the next one sold in hot dogs.
 cultural misunderstanding my ass you fking disgusting PIG. You both she be kicked out of this Country.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/woman-claims-she-is-the-daughter-of-marilyn-monroe-and-jfk/
", Woman claims she is the daughter of Marilyn Monroe and JFK," Gladys Baker Morris spent most of her life believing that Marilyn Monroe’s cousin, Meredith Baker, was her biological mother.
 In March 2014, while on her deathbed, her “mother” told her that she had actually been adopted and that her biological parents were incredibly famous.
 After hearing her mother’s confession, Ms. Morris underwent a lot of research to clarify her origins and rapidly found out that she had indeed been adopted.
 In took a total of 18 months of legal proceedings, however, before she was finally able to obtain her adoption record, including her birth certificate.
 This amazing document, which has become the cornerstone of her legal claim, clearly states that she is the daughter of Norma Jeane Mortenson, better known as Marilyn Monroe, and of the assassinated U.S. President, Jonh F. Kennedy.
 Marilyn Monroe and President John Fitzgerald Kennedy are known to have had an affair in 1961-62, and Ms. Morris claims she was born from that extramarital relationship.
 More than 50 years after her death, stories concerning Marilyn Monroe’s love life or alleged pregnancies continue to regularly make the headlines.
 Two ill-fated pregnancies in 1957 and 1959 are known to have led the actress to have surgery to correct an ectopic pregnancy.
 Some persistent rumors, originating from her gynecologist, Dr. Leon Krohn, have suggested that Marilyn Monroe had become pregnant again in 1961, and given birth to a baby girl in June 1962.
 There has always been very little evidence to back these allegations, however,  and many people hope that the court procedures launched by Ms. Morris will finally bring an end to more than 50 years of speculation, concerning the existence and identity of this mysterious child.
 In 2008, a Californian woman named Nancy Maniscalco Miracle made the headlines by claiming to be the lost daughter of Marilyn Monroe, while releasing a controversial biography of the star. Her claims were rapidly dismissed and proven to be a publicity stunt, when the DNA test confirmed that she had no filiation with the star, whatsoever.
 Gladys Baker Morris must now wait for the results of the DNA tests before she can launch any lawsuits to claim any eventual heirloom.
 If her claims turn out to be true, she could the only natural heir to the estate of Marilyn Monroe, which is estimated to be worth more than $100 million and still makes more than $5M each year.
 Indeed, she confirms that she intends to sue the Marilyn Monroe Foundation over rights and royalties, once the DNA test confirms her identity.
 She also hopes to be able to meet and possibly develop a relationship with her estranged half-sister, United States ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy.
 If I look form the side, I can see Rosie Odonnell &amp; Bill Cosbie, or if I squint my eyes I’d say Jocelyn Wildenstein and Pee Wee Herman – yeh that’s it, it’s definitely Pee Wee and Joce.
 She has a striking resemblance. Indeed she is a look alike.
 If she is MM and JFK’s child, I can’t wait to see the faces on the Kennedy clan when she sues for a portion of their money too!
 Shut the fuck up lol
 That’s actually Susan Griffiths.
 a lookalike!!

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/kenya-authorities-release-barack-obamas-real-birth-certificate/
", Kenya: Authorities Release Barack Obama’s “Real” Birth Certificate," These official papers had been requested for years by the Tea Party Patriots, an American conservative organization, to no avail, but the Kenyan Supreme Court recently ordered authorities to release the documents, based on a law on “access to information.
 These files, if they turn out to be verifiable, could mean that Mr. Obama had no legal right to become the American president under the country’s law.
 The papers released today suggest that Barack Obama was actually born on March 7, 1960, in Lamu, Kenya, more than a year before his father moved to Hawaii, where he allegedly met his mother.
 This contradicts most of the documents presented by the presidential office over the last years, suggesting that either the American or the Kenyan papers are actually faked.
 The official version of Barack Obama’s birth presented by the White House in the past was that he was born on August 4, 1961, at the Kapi’olani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital (now called the Kapi’olani Medical Center for Women &amp; Children) in Honolulu, Hawaii.
 His parents were Ann Dunham, from Wichita, Kansas, and Barack Obama, Sr., a Luo from Nyang’oma Kogelo in the Nyanza Province, in what was then the “Colony and Protectorate of Kenya”.
 Mr. Obama Senior was attending the University of Hawaii at the time, where he supposedly met Ms. Dunham.

 had reported in 2004 that Obama was “Kenyan-Born”, but the lack of proof presented had led the rest of the mediatic world to dismiss the article has fake or unfounded.
 Jim Geraghty of the conservative website
  National Review Online
 may have sparked further speculation on June 9, 2008, when he asked Obama to release his birth certificate.
 Geraghty wrote that doing so could debunk several false rumors circulating on the Internet.
 Such rumors were very numerous at the time, covering many topics.
 These included namely: that his middle name was originally Muhammad rather than Hussein; that his mother had originally named him “Barry” rather than “Barack”; and that Barack Obama, Sr. was not his biological father, as well as the rumor that Barack Obama was not a natural-born Citizen.
 Mr. Obama and the White House had given no answer whatsoever to that request, choosing to simply ignore the question, but had finally released some documents that were allegedly Mr. Obama’s birth certificate in two different forms.
 The release of these certificates had seemed to put an end to the rumors at the time, but it is to be expected that the “Kenyan documents” will fuel a whole new wave of rumors and conspiracy theories.
 God tried to warn us what our country led by 0bama would lòók like, just in his name:
 An 0bamaNation or Abomination
 That’s exactly what we got!
 The American people have been betrayed by a wolf among a bunch of sheep! The American people must not give into Socialism being shoved on our Christian values and heritage from our Christian forefathers! We must as a nation in our Christianity continue to stand up for God and say as one voice no matter what our race no more totalitarian government is going to be tolerated or installed in our government period!
 Mba-trump did more for usa in 6 months than obama ever dreamed of in his lousy eight years!

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/florida-16-girls-found-pregnant-after-teenager-ejaculates-in-pool/
", Florida: 16 Girls Found Pregnant After Teenager Ejaculates in Pool," A simple weekend pool party turned to tragedy when one of the young men attending the birthday celebration ejaculated in the pool without warning the house guests, accidentally ending up impregnating half of the girls present at the celebration.
 “I’m glad I didn’t have my swimsuit that day,” remembers Daliah Jennings, present during the celebration.
 Tommy Coulter has admitted to ejaculating in the pool, thus accidentally impregnating 16 of the young women present
 The young man claims there was no sex at the party at all and that he only ejaculated in the pool by accident.
 “Some people in town say we had some kind of wild sex orgy going on and that’s how I got all those girls pregnant, but I’m proud to say that I am still a virgin and that if anyone doesn’t believe me, I’m ready to undergo medical examination to prove it if that’s what it takes,” says the 15 year old. “I’ve become some sort of a local celebrity.
 Dr. John Suzukima of Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare Hospital, who was the first to link the multiple births to a single cause, believes the young man has a rare medical condition called
  spermafortis
 which makes his semen unusually potent.
 Dr. John Suzukima of Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare Hospital believes Tommy Coulter has unusually potent semen
 “Clinical tests have proven that people who suffer from
  spermafortis
 have sperm counts close to a thousand times more potent and rich in spermatozoids than the average man,” he explains. “This kind of semen is fairly similar to that of common water mammals, such as dolphins, manatees and seals and has properties that make it incredibly resistant to water. This condition could definitely explain what happened in this case but clinical trials and further tests would be needed to prove this theory,” he told local reporters.
 Most of the 16 girls are scheduled to undergo an abortion although two of the impregnated girls’ families have reportedly admitted that they have decided to bring the birth to term being devout Christians.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/california-woman-sues-her-parents-because-she-is-ugly/
", California woman sues her parents because she is ugly," Annabelle Jefferson, 44, believes her parents are fully responsible for her unpleasant physical features which have led to her three divorces and a succession of depressions and psychological troubles.
 « Both of my parents are so damn ugly, it is simply cruel to have had kids. There is no way they should have been allowed to reproduce themselves .»
 Robert Jefferson, 82, and his wife Ruby Jefferson, 76, are being sued by their daughter because she says they shouldn’t have been allowed to reproduce in the first place.
 Jefferson blames her parents for her succession of unsuccessful marriages which led to a series of psychological problems.
 « During my first divorce, my ex-husband told the judge that every morning he saw my face, he felt nauseous and often had to run to the bathroom and puke, » she remembers painfully.
 The 44-year-old plans on starting an association for people who have had similar problems and who wish to sue their « ugly parents .»
 She also hopes to lobby the state department in the near future to pass legislation on banning people who don’t meet decent beauty or aesthetic criteria to be sterilized or not to be allowed to give birth so as to prevent others from suffering as much as she did.
 This is so sad!! She obviously has mental and emotional problems. And then to blame her parents. Even worse!!!
 where did she find a lawyer to take her case? he must be as ugly as she is. and no one divorced her because of her face; they saw that face–normal looking most of the time–when they married her. her ugly mind and heart must have shown up after a short while
 What she has is an ugly heart. She may try suing the devil for that.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/woman-develops-iq-of-220-after-drinking-sperm-everyday-for-a-year/
", Woman develops IQ of 220 after drinking sperm everyday for a year," 26-year old Alicia Franklin, was already a member of the high IQ society Mensa, after scoring 154 in her qualification test in September 2015.
 The young woman searched for ways to improve her intelligence, and after taking a new test three weeks ago, it seems that she succeeded.
 She allegedly raised her IQ by more than 65 points in 13 months, after she began ingesting a daily dose of fresh sperm. Her new results show that her cognitive intelligence, her perception, and her memory have all greatly improved.
 According to her latest supervised test, her IQ is now evaluated at 220, making her smarter than Stephen Hawkins, Albert Einstein, and Leonardo Da Vinci, and placing her among the most intelligent people in human history.
 According to Ms. Franklin, she started to notice the beneficial effects less than two weeks after she started ingesting semen.
 The Chair of Mensa International, Bibiána Balanyi, says that Ms. Franklin could now be one of the three most intelligent people in history.
 According to experts, Ms. Franklin’s theory is, indeed, founded on scientific facts, and it is very plausible to believe that people ingesting sperm could develop better intellectual capacities.
 Semen contains over 200 proteins and several helpful vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, calcium, chlorine, citric acid, fructose, lactic acid, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, vitamin B12, and zinc.
 It also contains mood-enhancing compounds such as cortisol, estrone, oxytocin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, prolactin, melatonin, and serotonin.
 Many of these elements could help get a better sleep, feel less stress and be in a better mood, which are all factors which may help to perform better.
 Were the test proctors mostly men?
 well, that’s what I told her the reason was anyways
 Come again
 Now I can convince my models girl friends to have sex with me and eat my semen

 “I did a lot of research on ways to improve my intelligence, and I found out that drinking sperm was probably the simplest and most efficient of them all,” she told Science Today. “There are many nutrients and chemical elements in it that are extremely important for the development of the brain.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/16-year-old-girl-claims-former-president-bill-clinton-is-her-father/
", 16-year Old Girl Claims Former President Bill Clinton is Her Father," Alyssa Gilmore claims that her mother, a former secretary of the oval office named Whitney Gilmore, had an affair with President Clinton between 1998 and 2001. She says she was born out of that relationship and demands that Mr. Clinton undergoes a paternity test to prove that her story is true.
 Whitney Gilmore does indeed appear on many official pictures of Bill Clinton, like this one of an Independence Day party on July 4, 2000 where she appears with the President and his wife Hillary.
 Judge Henri Watkins of the Arkansas state court, rapidly decided that Ms. Gilmore had enough evidence to support her demand and announced that the presentation of the evidence will begin on March 19.
 Bill Clinton wasn’t present in the courthouse this morning, in Little Rock, but he met the media less than an hour after the judge’s decision, in Washington.
 Mr. Clinton denied having an affair with Ms. Gilmore or being the father of the teenage girl. He adds that the timing of the accusations suggests that they are intended to ruin his wife’s chances in the run for the presidential elections in November.
 Bill Clinton appeared extremely irritated, even angry, when he met the media this morning, in Washington.
 This is not the first time that Bill Clinton is involved in an adultery-related scandal. The most famous case is of course when he admitted to having had what he called an “inappropriate relationship” with Monica Lewinsky
 while she worked at the White House in 1995 and 1996.
 There were also many other women who claimed over the years that they had affairs with Mr. Clinton or that they were victims of sexual misbehavior on his part.
 These include Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddick,  Kathleen Willey,  Elizabeth Ward Gracen and Dolly Kyle Browning.
 Many political experts believe that no matter how this court case ends, this new story of adultery has reminded the population of the Clinton couple’s particular relationship and story.
 They think it could therefore certainly have a very negative impact on Hillary’s chances of being the presidential candidate of the Democratic party for the next presidential election.
 “… I want to get this over with as soon as possible.”
 That’s what she said
 A DNA test is the perfect GET OUT OF JAIL FREE card. It can prove conclusively that Clinton is NOT the father.
 So if he is that sure, take the test and be innocent until the day he dies…

 “I know Bill Clinton is my father,” says the young girl. “I have many pictures of my mother and him and I know they were in love. He even gave me présents for Christmas and my birthdays when I was a kid before he left my mother. I have spent many years writing him letters and calling him, hoping he would come back in my life. At first, he would write back and we spoke on the phone regularly, but he doesn’t even answer anymore. I just want him to take his responsibilities and recognize that he is my father, that’s all.”

 “Whitney was indeed my secretary, and she has been a friend of both my wife and I for many years”


 . “I have worked with her for a few years, and I have met her daughter a few times. But we never had any sexual relationship and  I am not the father of Alyssa Gilmore. This whole thing is just a diversion created by the Republican party to ruin Hillary’s chances in the run for presidency. I want to get this over with as soon as possible.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/slaughterhouse-employee-accused-of-murdering-71-coworkers-over-17-years/
", Slaughterhouse Employee Accused of Murdering 71 Coworkers Over 17 years," Jeremiah Burroughs, age 57, has been formally accused of the murder of no less than 70 coworkers after the disappearance of 71 coworkers since 1998 had raised local authorities suspicions.
 The discovery this week of human bones in a neighboring rendering plant which recycles slaughterhouse byproducts had raised the alarm and forced local authorities to crack down on potential suspects.
 During 17 years, Jeremiah Burroughs is suspected of murdering a tragic 71 coworkers in the meat packing plant where he worked for over 22 years
 Jeremiah Burroughs, who is a Gulf war veteran, is suspected of suffering from PTSD syndrome and of extreme paranoia, explains police officer Emet Rubbens.
  “We have no idea why he committed these atrocious crimes, there seems to lack a motive. What is most distressing is how he got away with these atrocious crimes for such a long period of time” Officer Rubbens told reporters.
 It seems he just processed his victims’ meat as he would’ve done with any other cow. His victims all disappeared somewhere in the meat packing process” he expressed with disgust.
 Burroughs’ coworkers say there was nothing unusual about the man accused of 71 murders.
 “He was just a normal guy, like anybody else” admits coworker Adam Willfur.
  “I admit it’s strange that he still lived alone with his mother, but he seemed to really enjoy his work. He’d strip off the skin of a carcass in a matter of seconds and would chop off its limbs in a flash”.
 “Whatever he did, he was a heck of a good worker, that’s all I’ve got to say about him” admitted another.
  “It’s not an easy job, so we’re used to seeing people come in a few days and quit without notice” explains meat packing plant manager, Alan Longspan.
 “Never did we realize that they had been murdered and processed as food,” he told reporters, still visibly under shock.
  Under current state law and i
 f convicted, Burroughs could be sentenced to the capital punishment by the
 Texas Department of Criminal Justice
  (TDCJ)
 , believe experts.
 I’d like to know where the meat that is processed at the plant goes to exactly. Is it in Texas only? Where did this “meat” go?!
 I agree, there’s got to be people near there who are just SICK, track the meat products

", New Mexico: 116 Injured after Drunk Police Officer Tazes Suspect in Pool," Officer John F. Kelly who claims he was actively pursuing a possible suspect in a drug trafficking lead, showed up at the private pool and proceeded to arrest the suspect who allegedly refused to come out of the pool, leaving the police officer no other choice than to taze him, thus delivering over 50,000 volts of electricity to the pool swimmers, mostly young age children and teenagers.
 “The officer was completely drunk, we could barely understand what he was saying” explains Barbara Chang, mother of two.
 A witness’s cellphone captured dramatic images of the scene moments after Officer John F. Kelly had delivered an astonishing 50,000 volts of electricity to the pool full of children and teenagers
 No fewer than 116 swimmers were left injured by the electric shock but only three remain in critical condition.
 Albuquerque Police Department spokesman, Alberto Ramirez, claims the incident is gang-related.
 The police officer has been suspended with pay and the Albuquerque Police Department promises an investigation around the incident.
 Interesting news I love it
 who is this drunken cop’per related to, that he got to skip training? Did the kid look like a traditionally? He he have dark skin? U know cops,. They never pass up on an opportunity to shoot a ‘N(**a’, as the cops refer to as black people. Just imagine how much worse this is gonna get when the One World Order is instituted.
 Why is this crazy police officer on *paid* suspension? Paid?? Especially if he was drunk!! Police think they can get away with anything and they usually DO!

  “He was pointing at a group of Latino teenagers, telling them to drop their weapons, but no one had any weapon, they were just playing in the pool,” she told local reporters.
 

 
  “Although the suspect was wrongfully identified in this case, we believe the police officer acted on behalf of his concerns for the security of the general public, unfortunately leading to this tragic incident,” he told local reporters.

"," Lottery winner arrested for dumping $200,000 of manure on ex-boss’ lawn"," 54-year old Brian Morris, from the small town of Clarendon Hills in Dupage County, bought over 20,000 tons of manure and asked for it to be dumped on his former boss’ property, pretending it was his residence.
 Dozens of trucks filled with manure showed up in front of the house around 6:00 this morning and began dumping their smelly cargo over the property’s lawn.
 George Fitzgerald, Mr. Morris’ former employer, was awakened by the sound of the vehicles on his property and rapidly called the police.
 Unfortunately, it took the police more than 15 minutes to arrive on the site, and more than 10,000 tons of manure had already been dumped in the meantime.
 Brian Morris was standing right across the street and laughing when the police arrived, and he rapidly came over to confess his responsibility and explain his motivations.
 Lieutenant Frank Meyers, a spokesman of the Clarendon Hills Police Department, met the press a few hours later to explain the motivations behind this strange crime.
 The Clarendon Hills Police Department admitted that its response time was inadequate and said it would keep a close eye on Mr. Morris to avoid any more incidents.
 Brian Morris had attracted a lot of media attention two weeks ago after winning $125 million at Powerball Multi-state lottery.
 When asked by organizers what he would do with the money, he had simply answered: “
  Just read the news, you’ll see
 “.
 He was freed on bail a few hours after his arrest, and told reporters to “
  stay alert
 “, claiming he had “
  a few other pranks to pull over the next few weeks
 “.
 This guy is completely pathetic! I just gave two homeless guys out here in California $20 each and I’m not rich. Just think of how may people this guy could have helped with that money! He could change people’s lives! Judge, throw the book at him. Teach him a lesson! He need some humbling and a load of character development! What a TERRIBLE example he has given us for how a man should behave.
 Oh grow up. This man owes nobody ANYTHING. You’re just jealous.
 If you lived in California, your boss would have sued you for the $125 million you won. I would leave well enough alone, before you need to find another job.
 Good going Brian, I am glad to here that what goes around comes around. I would have done the same thing but probably worst, a long with other people who treat you like s t.Keep it up. Glad you won the lottery.
 I’m sure it felt good but wouldn’t it feel even better to drop $224,000 worth of groceries at the stoop of the local food pantry?
 Good job Brian just want to know how it feels!!!! hero to all of us people out there busting our asses every day and get treated like s*** because we have no choice but to work I to dream of the day Karma will show her big smile and I will be able to to something to that effect maybe not manure but something pretty cool like that
 Good for him! LOL, I’m sure that his boss deserved it! and some!

", Woman arrested for trying out dozens of sex toys in the middle of a Walmart store," The Union City Police Department received a call from the department store manager around 9:45 this morning, reporting that a customer was behaving indecently.
 Upon arriving on the site, the officers found 27-year old Laura Martinez lying almost naked on the floor and masturbating with a vibrator.
 According to Darlene Anderson, an employee who witnessed the incident, Ms. Martinez used at least two dozen different toys before she was arrested.
 Ms. Anderson adds that she will be haunted by the images and sounds to which she was exposed today.
 Darlene Anderson, who witnessed the incident, says she will have nightmares about it. The store management confirmed that psychological help would be made available to employees who need it.
 Ms. Martinez now faces a total of 7 criminal charges including felony indecent exposure, causing public nuisance and disorderly conduct.
 She was freed on bail less than two hours after her arrest and is expected to be back in court in November for the beginning of her trial.
 Her lawyer, Mr. James Mulford described the charges as “excessive and unjustified” and said he’s convinced of her innocence.
 According to him, the young woman did not intend to attract attention to her genitals but was just testing the merchandise with the clear intent of buying some of the products.
 If found guilty on all charges, the young woman could face a maximum of 3 years in jail and a fine of $25,000.

 “It was the grossest thing I’ve seen in my life. That fat lady just dropped her pants and started testing every dildo and vibrator we have

 in front of everyone!”

 
  “The worst part was her moaning and screaming. It was disgusting! I’m pretty sure I’ll have nightmares about it.”

", Man high on ecstasy burns own genitals while trying to have sex with electric fence," Adam Weinberg, 26, was rescued by fellow partygoers of the illegally set up rave after they noticed he was in horrible agony and unable to unclamp himself from the electrified fence surrounding the area.
 The young man who was highly intoxicated on several drugs including ecstasy apparently mistook the electric fence for a sexual partner before feeling the burst of 220 volts and 13 amps passing through his body.
 “I was high as fuck. I’d taken some GHB and some DMT to start out the party. I then did a shit load of Ecstasy and a bunch of amphetamines before taking a few hits of cocaine. Then someone poured some acid drops into my eyes and I totally lost it,” he told reporters.
 “At first, the electricity passing through me was like the biggest orgasm I have ever had. I felt like my balls were going to explode, that’s when I felt the horrible burning sensation and the smell of burning flesh,” he remembers before passing out.
 Although he has sustained second-degree and third-degree burns to his lower abdomen and genitals, as well as having one of his testicles removed, Dr. Hellen Murdoch of HonorHealth Medical Center says that with reconstructive surgery he should recover swiftly.
 Adam Weinberg says he hopes his story will reach other young adults and prevent further injuries or even deaths.
 “I realize now that I am a drug addict and that I could’ve died in the most stupid way ever,” he told the Scottsdale Herald.
 “But if my testimony can help just one person not to do the same thing I did, it will be worth the shame and ridicule this news coverage will bring upon me,” he concluded.
 HonorHealth Medical Center spokesman John Seymour admits the hospital has noted an increase in recreative drug-related health problems in recent years but has never heard of such a case before.
 That’s definitely an offence 😂😂😂😂

 “I got really horny and wandered off in the desert and I saw all these hot naked chicks dancing around but later I figured out they were just wooden fence poles,” he recalled.

 “Some of my friends say I shouldn’t publicly talk about trying to have sex with an electric fence while high on ecstasy and that I will look like a fool,” he admitted.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/mexico-200-pounds-of-cocaine-found-in-washed-up-whale/
", Mexico: 200 Pounds of Cocaine Found in Washed Up Whale," The discovery of large bags of cocaine washed up on the shore completely baffled local authorities and led to an immediate autopsy of the large sea mammal estimated to weigh over 160 tons.
 The large shipment of cocaine, which is the largest quantity of cocaine to ever wash ashore in the region, has resulted in an international inquiry led by the Mexican government in cooperation with the US Drug Enforcement Agency to investigate into the matter.
 Officials proceeded to an autopsy of the whale after deflating the carcass, which was bloated with methane gas, and could have exploded, before extracting more than 200 pounds of cocaine from the whale’s stomach
 Specialists believe the smugglers lured the giant mammal with a dead giant squid as bait, as the bags of cocaine seemed to lay inside the digested remains of a squid.
 “Never have I had to deal with such a situation in my 23 year career” explains DEA officer Robert Grant.
 “Let’s hope they learn this as a lesson and don’t try this pathetic attempt again” he said, visibly furious.
  A street value estimated to over $9.6 million
 If the bulk value of the cocaine has been estimated at $2,455,000, however, if broken down and sold, the street value is over $9.6 million, estimate experts.
 The cocaine is linked to the Gulf Cartel by experts
 “The packages were all stamped with a dolphin logo, indicative of narcotics belonging to the Gulf Cartel” explains local police chief, Juan Roberto Gonzalez.
 “It is a tragedy that they are using animals to do their dirty business, we hope an international investigation can prevent such incidents from happening again” he told a local news crew.
 Last May, a similar shipment was found on the seashore of Galveston, Texas, where 66 pounds of cocaine were discovered by authorities.
 maybe this was the CIA attempting new methods of smuggling…

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/101-year-old-woman-gives-birth-after-successful-ovary-transplant/
", 101-Year-Old Woman Gives Birth After Successful Ovary Transplant," The illegal and controversial surgical operation was done in a private clinic in Turkey, where European laws on ovary transplants do not apply, admits the centennial mother who does not wish to disclose the name of the clinic where the operation was undertaken.
 “I am very grateful to all the team of doctors who decided to go on with the operation,” she admitted in tears.
 “For so long I have felt useless to God, I could not procreate since I turned 48 years old when I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. For a long time I believed God was punishing me for only bearing 16 children, but in his godly generosity, he has granted me with fertility once again,” acknowledges the century-old fervent Catholic.
 Dr. Alexandro Popolicchi fully endorses the controversial ovary transplant, which is deemed illegal under European health laws, and which was undertaken in a private clinic in Turkey where such laws do not apply
 Although he admits the procedure is highly controversial, Dr. Popolicchi believes the ultimate decision was up to his patient to make.
 “Who am I to judge if it is the proper thing to do? She has given birth to a beautiful baby and this miraculous birth is definitely a gift from God!” he told reporters.
 “So many children are born in this world unwanted or by accident. Is it not a beautiful thing to know this child comes to life in a loving home?” he asked reporters.
 Although Miss Vertadella’s husband has passed away since 1998, the century-old widow has managed to find a sperm donor to make the birth possible.
 “I met Francesco’s father on the internet while trying to find a father to my child. This 26-year-old man is a Catholic and that is all that is important to me. I wanted my child to be born in a union sanctified by the Catholic church” she explained.
 “I know we are not married and that he will not play a part in Francesco’s life, but I have written to the pope to ask for his absolution. I have also named my child after the pope in his honor and so I believe he should find a place in his heart to forgive me in this particular situation” she added with a prayer.
 “I still love my deceased husband and desire to stay a widow until I leave this earth, but I needed the seed of this young fervent Catholic to fulfill God’s will,” she concluded.
 Malegwale Ramokgopa allegedly gave birth to her 25th and 26th child in 1931 at the venerable age of 92
 The world’s oldest mother was previously believed to be Malegwale Ramokgopa, a woman born in South Africa in 1839 who allegedly gave birth to twins three days after celebrating her 92nd anniversary on October 3, 1931, which made nation-wide headlines at the time.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/man-claiming-to-be-the-real-prince-harry-found-dead-in-irish-hotel/
", Man claiming to be “the real Prince Harry” found dead in Irish hotel," The Garda Síochána (Irish police) was called on the site early this morning, after some neighbors complained about the smell emanating from his room.
 They found the body of 31-year old, James Francis Alexander, a young British nobleman mostly known for his claim to be a member of the Royal British family.
 According to the spokesman of the Irish police, Lt. Seamus O’connor, the young man had multiple bullet wounds, and the police found some signs of struggle in his room, suggesting that he was victim of a violent crime.
  “The victim clearly didn’t commit suicide,”
 Lt. O’connor told reporters.
  “He was attacked by more than one assailant, probably two or three individuals, carrying pistols. The poor man didn’t stand a chance. He was hit by more than 20 bullets, probably fired by silenced weapons, since none of his neighbours heard anything. It’s too early to confirm anything, but this is probably the work of professionals.”
 James Francis Alexander, the son of a British Lord from Lincolnshire, claimed he was in fact Prince Harry, and had been exchanged when he was 8-years old for threatening to reveal that he was not the son of Prince Charles.
 Mr Alexander had attracted a lot of attention from the British public and media in 2014, when he published his book entitled “
  The real Prince Harry: The truth behind the Royal lies
 “.
 In this book, he claimed to be the real son of Princess Diana, saying that he was replaced by a look-alike at Queen Elizabeth’s demand when he was 8-years old, after he threatened to reveal that Prince Charles was not his biological father.
 He says that he was awoken at night by his father’s butler and driven to Lincolnshire, where he was exchanged with the son of Lord Edward James Alexander, who had his age and also the particularity of looking a lot like him.
 His claims had received some intense coverage for a while from the British tabloids, but then had suddenly disappeared from the media after a few days, generating rumors of cover-up among conspiracy theorists.
 Indeed, despite the fact that the first 50 000 copies of his book had sold in less then a week, his publisher had surprisingly decided not to have more copies printed and it rapidly disappeared from bookstores.
 The young author had then accused the Royal family of pressuring his publisher and his editor, in order to have his book taken off the shelves.
 An encounter between Mr Alexander and Prince Charles at the 2014 London Book Fair had resulted in a rather digraceful scene, as the heir to the British throne called the young man “a little bastard”, before telling him to “leave his family alone”.
 Mr Alexander fled England in January 2015 and sought asylum in Ireland, saying that he was being followed and harassed by the MI5 and that he had received multiple death threats by extremist supporters of the British monarchy.
 Some sources close to the young man, told
  The Daily Beast
 that he had recently had contacts with the British embassy concerning an eventual return to England, and that he even had dinner with an attaché of the embassy at the end of the month of March, probably less than 24 hours before he was killed.
 Despite these shocking coincidences, the police refuses for the moment, to link the British embassy or secret services to Mr Alexander’s death, saying that they are “following every possible lead” that could help them solve the case.
 The poor guy got killed n robbed of his royal life since age 8. How awful.
 well isnt this a “coincidence”.
 No doubt MI5/6 were involved in protecting their queen, becuase the U and britain dont exist as a country – its all “HER ROYAL HIGHNESS’ CROWN PROPERTY”.
 The monarchy needs to be abolished.
 DNA, would tell all.
 He looks like a Spencer. When it comes to the elite anything is possible since they have the attitude of entitlement.
 HE DOES!!!! HE LOOKS LIKE WILL TOO.
 All you need is Princess Diana’s broth Earl Spencer to do dna.

"," Purina Employee Arrested for Stealing and Eating Over 30,000$ of Dog Biscuits"," A Philadelphia native, Barry Larson, is accused of stealing more than 150,000
  Milkbone
 dog biscuits between the month of August 2013 and March 2015. Surprisingly, the 49-year old employee doesn’t even own a pet and would have ingested nearly 3000 dog biscuits per day during his work hours, according to Purina spokesman, Keith Schopp.
 The employee was caught on camera on several occasions over the last weeks, eating hundreds of biscuits at a time during his work hours.
 The Allentown Police Department and the Pennsylvania state troopers met the media this afternoon to comment this rather unusual case. Public relations officer of the state police, Capt. Brian Tobin confirmed that the company did most of the investigative work and built a very solid case against Mr. Larson.
 The press conference of the Allentown Police Department attracted a surprising amount of media attention, as dozens of journalists from all over the American East Coast were present in the small conference room.
 Barry Larson’s ex-girlfriend, Patricia Nelson, told a reporter from WKPN 23, that she was aware of his “
  addictions
 ” to both cannabis and dog biscuits, and that she had actually left him when she had found out.
 Mr. Larson is expected to appear before a Lehigh County court to present his plea on Friday, concerning 15 charges of petty theft and one charge of drug possession.
 Darn, not only did he eat them at work, but he brought home a doggie bag.
 When I said that to my dog ¨BUDDY¨ he was so angry
 that he wanted to take a bit off my lawyer.
 Now I am stuck with a $2000.00 layer BILL and a
 $1.000.000.00 lawsuit from my lawyer.
 I wonder how he started???!!! I need more details, did anyone ask him why?!
 Apparently managements’ suspicions were first raised when he was seen peeing on the tyres of the cars in the car park, &amp; then he tried humping his supervisors leg. On full moon nights, he would howl at the moon.
 He lifted his leg and pissed on a fire hydrant. The only problem was, that he forgot to drop his draws and peed his pants

 Allentown, PA | An employee of a Purina pet food plant, was arrested this morning by the Allentown Police Department and Pennsylvania state troopers, after being accused of stealing more than 30,000$ in pet food over the last 18 months.

 Milkbone


 “We noticed a few months ago that something was wrong with our dog biscuit production,”


 “When we checked the quantity of ingredients that were used in the production and the number of biscuits that were produced, the numbers just didn’t add up! We began installing more security cameras at various strategic locations throughout the factory, and we were finally able to identify the problem. Mr. Larson, who worked in the quality check sector, was eating almost half of the biscuits that went by him.”

 “Purina has provided us with hours of video evidence in which we see the suspect smoke drugs on his work site, and then eat hundreds of dog biscuits”


 “The images are a little bit disturbing, but very conclusive in terms of evidence. We proceeded with Mr. Larson’s arrest this morning for 15 charges of petty theft, and found him to be in possession of 10 grams of cannabis.”

 addictions


 “Every night, he came back from work with a really horrible breath”


 “It was not just a normal bad breath, it was really a foul stench that never left, even if he brushed his teeth or used mouthwash. One day, I came back from work earlier than usual, and surprised him with his mouth full of dog biscuits! I nearly threw up! I was so disgusted, that I packed my things and left. I didn’t know, however, that he was stealing the biscuits…”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/man-emasculated-after-trying-to-use-air-compressor-to-enlarge-his-penis/
", Man emasculated after trying to use air compressor to enlarge his penis," 37-year old Ryan Davies, from Paterson in New Jersey, was lying unconscious in a pool of blood when his wife found him last night, so she immediately called the paramedics.
 He was rapidly transported to the hospital where he arrived in critical condition, but doctors were finally able to stabilize him after a few hours.
 Upon regaining consciousness, he admitted that he had tried everything to enlarge his penis over the last two years, and had already invested $15,000 in pills and penile pumps, without success.
 He finally decided to try his industrial air compressor, and he insists that his genitals did enlarge during the first few seconds before they literally exploded.
 Despite this “partial success”, he has now lost more than 90% of his genitals and may suffer from critical consequences for the rest of his life.
 Dr. Michael Hart, who specializes in penile surgery, says Mr.Davies’ genitals are too damaged to be saved, but that he could eventually be grafted a new penis.
 This isn’t the third accident involving makeshift “penis enlargement devices” this month in New Jersey, and authorities fear this could be the consequences of a new trend.
 Dr. Michael Hart, one of the most renowned penile surgeon in the world, says this kind of incident is bound to happen more often over the next few years as men become increasingly obsessed with the size of their genitals.
 Dr. Hart insists that men should never use improvised penis enlargement methods, and should consult a specialist to learn about effective treatments and possible surgeries.
 Last year, 7,357 men were hospitalized across the United States in relation to penis enlargement treatments or devices, an increase of 44% compared to 2016.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/7-year-old-girl-receives-breast-implants-for-christmas/
", 7-year old girl receives breast implants for Christmas," The 7-year old had been asking her parents constantly for the last two years, insisting she needed breast implants and begging for a surgery.
 Her mother, Dana Manson,  says she tried to convince Juliet that her breasts would grow with time, but her daughter was “completely obsessed” with the idea of getting breast implants.
 Ms. Manson even consulted a psychiatrist with her daughter, hoping to rid Juliet of her obsession. The result, however, was very different from what she expected.
 After a dozen sessions with the young girl, the renowned psychiatrist Eduardo Ramirez concluded that she was suffering from a severe depression and had a serious lack of self-esteem,  and told her mother that a surgery could be beneficial.
 Doctor Ramirez says the young girl has developed some serious complexes about her appearance over the years, and the operation will help her get an improved image of herself.
 Following the psychiatrist’s advice, Ms. Manson contacted dozens of clinics in the United States and Mexico, but none of them were willing to perform a breast augmentation surgery on such a young girl.
 She finally found a clinic in the city of Hangzhou in China, where doctors were willing to perform the operation.
 Dana Manson decided that she would go on the trip to Asia with her daughter over the holidays and that the surgery would count as her Christmas present.
 They left for China on December 22, and the surgery was performed two days later. According to the clinic, the operation took less than two hours and went exactly as planned.
 The young girl now has a 30C cup, and her mother says she’s “extremely happy about her about her new breasts”.
 Dana Manson told NBC that like every mother in the world, she wanted her children to be happy and that Juliet was clearly unhappy about not having any breasts.
 The young girl’s story caught the world’s attention after she posted several pictures of herself on her Instagram account only hours after the surgery, instantly causing a storm of reactions on the social media.
 Many people are denouncing the Manson parents for allowing their daughter to undergo plastic surgery at such a young age, while others are blaming her psychiatrist for his recommendation.
 Despite the critics, Dana Manson says she did “what was best for her daughter” and insists that she has no regrets.
 Someone asked what if she wanted condoms? Her mother had better teach her how to use condoms immediately! Better yet put her on BC. or get her a diaphram because she’s sure to be the most sought after girl in school.
 Can you imagine all the boys in her class all get to feeling them? Then the janitor takes her in the broom closet, pulls out his big long black broom handle and lets her ride his big black broom stick and pumps her little, well used to be, broom stick drainer full of that white tadpole stew. That is what she has to do everyday of school from now on.
 Wow – are you kidding me ???? This mother needs to be schooled on what it means to be a parent, plus the law needs to be involved. What a mess!!!
 I hope child protection were waiting at the airport. There is a reason no US surgeon would do it…What is it? She hates her husband that much she needs his focus else where…NO!then why steal her childhood
 The greatest lesson a child can ever learn is NO!

", Man transported to hospital after getting squirrel stuck in his rectum," 60-year Ray Frankfurt called 911 himself around 3 pm after he found himself in a pretty uncomfortable position.
 Janice Monroe, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation.
 Despite Ms. Monroe’s doubts, she sent an ambulance to the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious.
 Frank Meyers, one of the paramedics who transported Mr. Frankfurt, claims the poor man was lying naked in his bathroom and a hairy red tail was protruding from his anus.
 Ray Frankfurt was transported to the Huggings Hospital in Wolfeboro, where doctors were able to extract the rodent.
 The retired mailman suffered from severe internal bleeding but was finally stabilized after a two-hour surgery.
 The squirrel, unfortunately, didn’t survive his misadventure.
 This picture of Mr. Frankfurt with his beloved Slimy was taken less than a week before the incident.
 Mr. Frankfurt’s problem might seem fairly unusual, but similar incidents occur a lot more frequently than most people would think.
 Every year, an average of 5739 Americans are hospitalized after getting foreign objects stuck in their anal cavity.
 Among these “foreign objects”, an average of 19 are animals, including mostly fishes, snakes and small rodents like mice or rats.
 According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. Frankfurt is the first American to get a squirrel stuck in his rear end since 2007.
 He has refused to comment the incident and declined all demands for an interview.
 Stick a tree up your butt, stick a bee up your but.
 I worked in the ER for years it isn’t gay people who do this. It is usually married men or straight men.
 Very sad for the rodents these perverts stick up their hiney.I would pray for the rodents!!!?
 Why does it seem like these things happen mostly in America?

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/usa-confederate-war-general-revealed-to-be-a-woman/
", USA: Confederate Army General Revealed to Be a Woman," Newly disclosed information found in the last will of George Pickett’s father, Colonel Robert Pickett, proves without a doubt the Confederate war general was a woman.
 The discovery was made at an auction in Austin, Texas, this week as American historian Graham Brown got his hands on the precious document.
 The will proves without a doubt the famous general who participated in the Battle of Gettysburg was, in fact, Mary Sue Pickett, his older sister.
 It also appears clearly evident that George Edward Pickett was never part of any military enterprise, but instead, that his sister was, in fact, the real ‘man’ behind the legend.
 Official documents of the Pickett family released at the auction included documents confirming the death by tuberculosis of George Pickett at the tender age of 16.
 The death of the only boy of the family of eight possibly devastated his father, Colonel Robert Pickett, who dreamed of leaving a family military legacy behind him.
 “It was not uncommon at the time to fake documents or steal someone’s identity. What is truly interesting in this case, is that the former Colonel decided to send his daughter at the United States Military Academy in the place of his son and that she eventually showed to possess extraordinary military leadership” claims the Austin based historian.
 Mary Sue Pickett, who was George Pickett’s senior by one year, was also known to suffer from a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis, a condition where an excess of androgen creates a hormonal unbalance that results in female beard growth.
 “This particular condition played a great part in hiding her true identity to others throughout her adult life” admits John Adams White, an American Civil War historian and expert, who was the first to point out discrepancies in George Pickett’s biography.
 “The discovery of the will of Colonel Robert Pickett finally explains important anachronistic elements of the man’s life” he concedes.
 An American Mulan. !
 Well she did finish last in her class at West Point. Might explain it.
 You know, George is my greatx5 uncle. I guess I have an aunt now, too
 He is my relation also. Trying to do some genealogy. You should get in touch
 I’m a descendant of George Pickett as well. Actually my great grandmothers maiden name was Pickett. Seeing as how the name was passed on and he was the only male sibling, how in fuck could he be a female? A general would have never been able to hide the fact of being a women. It surprises me how surprised I am that people are so ignorant to obvious fact. Get a life and take your liberal ass propaganda to Hell with you.
 No wonder he was considered the best general cook in the confederate army.
 So if anyone tries to remove a Pickett statue, they can now be called a misogynist……

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/china-billionaire-killed-by-champagne-bottle-cork/
", China: Billionaire Killed By Champagne Bottle Cork,"  Hong Kong| 49-year old Dingxiang Loeng, a well-known and very flamboyant Chinese businessman, died this morning in his suite of the Island Shangri-La hotel during a reception he was holding for his birthday. According to some of the 217 witnesses of the tragedy, it is while opening a champagne bottle that the billionaire was hit violently in the temple by the cork, an accident that caused a fatal brain hemorrhage.
 The accident took place during a sumptuous party that was being held to celebrate Mr. Loeng’s 50th birthday, that would have taken place on August 2nd. Nearly 200 guests were present, including most of Hong Kong’s political and economic elite, when the celebrated, after a brief speech, opened a bottle of champagne and was hit violently in the head by the cork. Many witnesses actually laughed at first, greatly underestimating the severity of the injury,  but an eerie silence rapidly overcame the crowd as Mr. Loeng remained unconscious and the medical staff was urged on the site. Despite all the efforts of the paramedics, his death was confirmed less than twenty minutes later while he was being carried to the hospital.
 Many of the guests who had laughed at first, were visibly emotional after the announcement of Mr. Loeng’s death.
 Rated the 51st richest in Hong Kong according to the Forbes business magazine, Mr. Loeng was an eccentric real estate tycoon who made a fortune in some very controversial deals in the years preceding the transfer of sovereignty of the former British colony to China. Even if his fortune is estimated at more than 1 billion dollars, the Hong Kong businessman was always better known for his various antics  and legal problems than for his economic activities.
   He was notorious for his drinking habit, drug problems and bad temper, having been arrested more than thirty times over the years for various charges, including public drunkenness, disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, driving under the influence of alcohol and assault on a hotel doorman.
 According to the police, the champagne bottle could have been a Chinese counterfeit, an explanation that seems more than plausible for the exceptionally high level of carbon dioxide contained in it. The problem of counterfeit alcohol has become a major concern for the Chinese authorities over the last few years, as the quantity of forged liquors and wines has been soaring. Many experts estimate that as much as 80 per cent of the alcohol in most Chinese cities is fake, mostly using counterfeit branding, where spoiled, low grade bottles of wine are sold as the real deal, yielding unreal margins.
 The owners and staff of the hotel,  refused to comment the event or the accusation of selling couterfeit alcohol.
 A champagne cork in full flight won’t kill you , but it can pop an eye out of it’s socket….

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/florida-man-emasculated-during-failed-attempt-to-rape-pit-bull/
", Florida: Man emasculated during failed attempt to rape pit bull," Jesus Ramon Sanchez, from the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami, was allegedly attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with a 4-year-old male pit bull when the dog defended itself by tearing off the man’s genitals with its teeth.
 The incident took place around 8:30 this morning, in the Allen Morris Dog Park in Miami.
 According to witnesses, 4-year-old Spanky was playing with his owner in the park when Mister Sanchez grabbed him and attempted to rape him. The male pit bull violently resisted and severely injured its attacker’s legs, arms, and groin.
  “The dog was just running around, playing with a ball, when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it,” says Dorothy Steinberg, a witness of the events.
 According to its owner, this is the first time that Spanky has ever bitten anyone, and he acted strictly out of self-defense.
 Mr. Sanchez was bleeding abundantly during his transport to the Ryder Trauma Center, but the doctors were able to stabilize him and they no longer fear for his life.
 Unfortunately, despite tremendous efforts, the medical staff wasn’t able to save his genitals, which were almost entirely destroyed by the dog.
 The motivations behind Mr. Sanchez’s actions remain unclear, and he could still face some criminal charges since the Miami Police Department has opened an investigation into the incident.
 Good dog. Steaks for you. 🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖
 good dog!
 Glad to know justice was served!!!!!

 “The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything, but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds, he grabbed the man’s genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart.”

", Alabama Man Cheated On His Wife With A Goat," She was actually consulting the history of her web browser when she discovered the double life of her husband, who took pleasure posting the controversial videos on his YouTube account.
 Chewie, the small family goat, was the victim of sexual abuse for more than two years
 The videos, that have now been removed from YouTube, led to the arrest of the 36-year-old man who would have taken affection not only to the family pet goat, but also to other animals of the small family farm such as a turkey, a lamb and even their emu, if one believes the diary of the accused man, found at the scene.
 His wife never suspected his double life
 Sadly, this is not the first time that such acts occur in the small community where as much as 17 cases of gruesome bestiality have been identified in the last five years, a situation that worries the authorities who say they are powerless in front of such a situation.
 Actually, he cheated on the goat with the wife. Im sure hes been humping goats a loooong time.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/homosexuality-led-to-extinction-of-dinosaurs-claims-top-scientist/
"," ‘Homosexuality Led to Extinction of Dinosaurs’, Claims Top Scientist"," Anthony Othman, a renowned paleontologist and leading curator at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky,  firmly believes homosexuality, and not an asteroid colliding with Earth as is commonly believed, was the main cause of the disappearance of the dinosaurs more than 66 million years ago.
 “I’m not saying the asteroid that hit Earth didn’t kill many dinosaurs, I’m just saying it was definitely not the main cause,” he explains, visibly enthusiast when reached on the phone.
 “It is by studying the behavior of homosexual iguanas in the Galápagos islands that I first came to this conclusion over 25 years ago” he adds.
 Paleontologist Anthony Othman firmly believes homosexuality, and not an asteroid impact, was the main cause for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.
 Dr. Othman argues that the practice of homosexuality in reptiles today is similar to the behavior of the dinosaurs and is defined by a particular gene which is easily shown when artificial selection is applied.
 “I took the semen of iguanas who showed a high tendency towards homosexuality and preferred the presence of same-sex mates » he acknowledges. « I then proceeded to impregnate female specimens of a small group of individuals,” he explains.
 “After three or four generations, the males, as well as the females of the species, lost all appetite for heterosexual behavior and the group, if not impregnated artificially, would not have survived beyond the fifth generation” he comments, visibly proud of his discovery.
 “Recent findings of massive numbers of velociraptor fossils in the region, all male, tend to prove my latest findings” he concludes.
 A 2014 Oxford University study showed that amongst amphibians, reptiles, and birds, homosexual behavior is fairly common. Mammals, on the contrary, were found to have a preference for heterosexuality, an evolutionary trait that might have given them a slight advantage in the long run, believe many experts.
 Did I miss the part where he explained that the homosexual dinosaurs came from heterosexual mating? It must have been natural, because he wasn’t there to artificially impregnate the gay female lizards. Also, of the thousands of varieties of dinosaurs, which ones were openly gay? Yet they still survived 160 million years while humans have only been around for 5 million years. (or is it 6000 years according to the creationists?)
 Can anyone suggest a mechanism by which homosexual velocirators would produce a preponderance of male offspring? I’m wondering if Othman forgot that to pass traits on requires heterosexual reproduction. Does he think that homosexuals are produced by homosexual mating?
 Top Scientist? Yeah, right! A paleontologist and leading curator at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky. That says it all. Closet homosexual probably.
 He missed a little insignificant detail there: he had to ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATE female iguanas with gay male iguanas’ sperm. Because NATURALLY those “gay iguanas” would NEVER have mated with females, therefore those ” mutant gay genes” would not have passed on to another generation, assuming his claim HAD any value at all.
 Since I’ve never heard of dinosaurs having fertility clinics, I seriously doubt gay dinos would’ve reproduced via AI.
 Makes me wish I wasn’t from Kentucky!

", New Jersey: Gay Couple Discovers They Are in Fact Long Lost Twins," Both men were convinced into going for DNA tests after friends and family members urged them to check out if they had any family ties due to their remarkable resemblance.
 “We did the tests partly as a joke and to shut up some of our friends who were constantly teasing us about being cousins,” remarks Jason.
 “Never did I expect to learn we were in fact long lost twins” he admits, visibly disheartened by the news.
 “The man that I expected to spend my life with, my soul mate, is, in fact, my twin brother. I don’t know if I have to cry or to jump with joy,” he admits in tears.
 Jason Osbourne and Alex Brown, who met two years ago during a modeling gig in New York, have since been inseparable
 If Jason Osbourne believes the DNA testing has brought them a relatively good news, his twin brother Alex does not take it as lightly.
 “Alex refuses to talk to me anymore, he even threatened to turn heterosexual over the whole affair, saying that he now wants a normal life like everyone else,” he acknowledged with sadness.
 “I told him we should cherish this news and celebrate the fact we have found each other again, but he doesn’t see it that way,” he told local reporters.
 Both men were separated at birth and adopted in different families although they both were unaware of this fact until the DNA testing.
 “It’s only when I confronted my parents that they finally admitted to the truth,” admits Jason Osbourne.
 “First I learn that my gay lover is my twin brother, now I learn I was adopted and that my parents have lied to me all my life. What a heck of a way to celebrate my 25th birthday” he adds, visibly furious.
 “Sometimes I wish we had never gone for that DNA test,” he added.
 Sexual relations between siblings are prohibited in the United States but the two brothers should not be prosecuted because of the particularities of this specific case, believe legal experts.
 Gay relación in twins is normal. I am twin and me and my twin fucked before me coming out. It made us closer.
 This, from one of them, says a lot, a whole lot. He knows what’s normal…
 “Alex refuses to talk to me anymore, he even threatened to turn heterosexual over the whole affair, saying that he now wants a normal life like everyone else,”
 Lindsay and Quincy you’re so completely spot on with the book end thing. Just makes me ill. So over narcissistic white gay men who think they are doing the rest of us a favor by existing.

 Famous punk songs of the legendary punk band the Sex pistols were even scripted by a team of psychologists and war propagandists of the USSR.
 “I am an anarchist”, “God save the Queen the fascist regime”, “No future” and other nihilist and anti-establishment lyrics were intended to unleash a wave of cynicism towards authorities, promote the use of heavy drugs and entice the youth with revolutionary, counter-establishment ideas.
 The 1970s punk subculture movement was allegedly financed by the USSR, says ex-KGB agent, Alexandrei Varennikovic Voloshin
 The retired KGB agent claims the maneuver was extremely successful.
 “Our mission was to use teenage angst to our advantage and turn the baby boomer generation of the West into a decadent, pro-drug and anti-establishment culture that would create uprisings and bring Western democracies into utter chaos.
 We even infiltrated mainstream radios to promote their music and reach millions of people every day” he admitted, visibly proud of the accomplishment.

  was expressed in the use of harder, more self-destructive drugs like heroin and methamphetamine, pushed United States President Richard Nixon into the War on Drugs, a campaign of prohibition of drugs, military aid, and military intervention, with the stated aim being to define and reduce the illegal drug trade within America and around the world.

", Saudi woman dies after husband leaves her in car for 10 hours," According to Saudi authorities, Fiza Haifeh died of hyperthermia after spending more than 10 hours locked up in her husband’s car, with the temperature hovering around 45 °C (113 Fahrenheit) much of the afternoon.
 Her husband told officers that he didn’t have time to drop his wife off at home before going to work and that he forgot to open a window like he usually did when he left her in the car.
 The temperature inside the car is believed to have rapidly reached over 70 °C (158 Fahrenheit). Stuck inside the car for hours at such temperatures, the woman had no chance of survival.
 Saudi Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, told reporters that no charges would be filed against Fiza Haifeh’s husband, since her death was unintentional.
 Every year, approximately 2500 people die of hyperthermia across the world after being left in vehicles.
 The majority of these victims are elderly people or young children. In the Arabian peninsula, however, more than 75% of the victims are adult woman, who are left in cars by their husbands or brethren.
 In Saudi Arabia alone, the numbers of heatstroke deaths of women in cars averages 37 a year, with a record of 49 in 2010.
 According to Human Rights Watch, these women prefer to remain in the vehicles and endure unbearable heat rather than exiting and facing possible arrest and physical punishment.
 Although women’s rights have been incrementally extended in recent years, women who walk alone in the street still face up to 50 lashes if they get caught.
 You are right Liz. But It seems she fall unconscious before. These rules should change. Thry are not related zo any,culture or religion.
 She didn’t have to leave the car, she could have just opened the door at intervals to let in air.
 Death was freedom for her….

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/saudi-man-sentenced-to-1000-lashes-for-performing-oral-sex-on-a-camel/
"," Saudi man sentenced to 1,000 lashes for performing oral sex on a camel"," Abdullah al-Rashidi, 26, was tending to the herd of camels when he was caught performing a fellatio on one of the animals before local authorities were called in and proceeded to his arrest.
 Al-Rashidi’s employer first hesitated before calling the police but said he could not tolerate such an act of perversion before God and that his employee’s actions needed to be punished.
 “When I found him licking the camel’s penis, he first told me that he was drinking the sperm from the camel to cure his oral herpes infection,” his employer told the judge.
  “I then asked him where he had heard that swallowing the sperm of a camel was a cure for anything,” he explained, visibly concerned.
 Drinking camel urine is reputed to have many health benefits but sperm is not known to have any curative powers admit experts.
 Judge Muhammad El Fehdi expressed his moral disgust towards the young man, warning him that he had not only disgraced himself but his entire family before God.
 “How ashamed your father and mother must be and how much they must regret giving birth to a son who enjoys fondling the genitals of camels,” the judge said in court.
 Al-Rashidi’s parents also pleaded the judge to give their son a harsh punishment so as to deter him from repeating the offense.
 Under intense questioning from the judge, the defendant admitted that it was not his first offense but that he had taken part in such activities previously a number of times.
 “I don’t know why I did it. I knew it was wrong but I could not resist,” said the young man, bursting into tears.
 “You are a young man who is starting your life, and so I will give you a light punishment, but if you are to repeat this immoral and disgraceful practice, next time I will be less lenient,” the judge told the young man.
 Abdullah al-Rashidi was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and two months in prison. According to Shariah law, in the case of bestiality, the animal becomes “unfit” and must be killed.
 He was also sentenced to pay SR 18,000 ($5,000 USD) to replace the worth of five of the camels he admitted having inappropriate relations with.
 Muhammad was a pediphile. What do you expect?
 Your father is a peedo
 The only sensible comment,Instead of the physical Punishment,The Judge should had Referred him to be treated by a Psychologist &amp;Rule that to report to him to make sure he is TREATED, This is a Torture Soul..?
 The epitome of cultural inbreeding. It invariably leads to all good things.

 “He then started crying and admitted that he just liked the taste. That is when I called the police,” his employer said in court.

 “I already have to live with the shame of having a son who likes putting camel penises into his mouth, may this punishment at least scare him away from turning into a homosexual,” she pleaded the judge.

 “Often sex with animals can lead to sleeping with human corpses or even worse, homosexuality,” the judge warned the defendant.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/doctors-confirm-first-human-death-officially-caused-by-gmos/
", Doctors Confirm First Human Death Officially Caused by GMOs," This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died at the Madrid hospital at the beginning of January.
 The young man’s health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient.
 The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.
 Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch.
 A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure.
 The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.
 The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.
 The young man appeared happy and healthy when this picture was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before he died.
 The medical examiners and forensic experts at the Carlos III hospital had to execute a lot of tests and analysis before they could precisely determine what caused Mr. Ramos to die of an allergic reaction to seafood since all he had eaten before his death was a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with a diet cola.
 They were astonished when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested, not only contained some fish-related allergens, but also some antibiotic resistant genes which had prevented Mr. Ramos’ white blood cell from saving his life.
  “At first we thought that there had been some form of contamination of his food, from contact with fish or seafood during the preparation” explained Dr. Rafael Pérez-Santamarina.
 Many experiments on GMOs had produced some horrible tumors and event death in rats and other lab animals, but most genetically modified products on the market were considered to be harmless to humans.
 The case of Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed to be linked to the ingestion of genetically modified food. It contradicts most studies on GMOs which had concluded that genetically engineered crops currently on the market were completely safe to eat.
 A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies.
 However, this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable, since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing.
 The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr. Ramos’ death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed.
 The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services, and Equality ordered for the tomatoes of Portuguese origin which infected the young man, to be recalled and removed from stores and markets for safety reasons.
 More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will, therefore, be ceased across the country by ministry inspectors and public safety officials.
 The ministry also issued a public statement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which it sends its condolences to his family and adds that it will
  “immediately demand further research on the subject to determine if other genetically modified food products on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population”
 .
 There is no reason they should be altering our food. The people that put the seafood gene in the tomatoes needs to be charged with murder. This is disgusting. And sad that someone has lost their life because some POS’s are altering our food.

 “It was only when we tested the tomato itself that we noticed that it contained some allergens usually found in seafood. We did many different analysis and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of the allergens that killed Mr. Ramos.”

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/boy-raised-by-kangaroos-discovered-in-australia/
", Boy Raised by Kangaroos Discovered in Australia," Many sightings of the boy had been reported by various ranchers of the region over the last months, and he had even drawn some attention from the local media.
 The child had been reported to accompany a mob of red kangaroos, which seemed to have adopted him as one of their own.
 Officers of the federal police were finally able to capture him this morning, 16 kilometers outside of Broken Hill.
 He was taken to the hospital immediately after his capture and was placed under the custody of agents from the Department of Child Protection.
 “We are trying to establish the actual age and identity of the boy” explains
  Australian Federal Police Commander, Glen McEwen
 .
 The kangaroos accompanying the child were very aggressive towards the AFP officers when they approached the young boy. Many of them even attacked the policemen, forcing the officers to use tranquilizing darts.
 The young boy was allegedly traveling and living with a group of a dozen kangaroos in the western regions of the province of New South Wales.
 A few ranchers had reported seeing him around their property, scavenging various fallen fruits, seeds and nuts. Back in April, a man from Silverton even claimed to have seen him on his property, grazing fresh grasses and forbs with other kangaroos.
 “He seems to have spent most of his day, resting in the shade, coming out at night to gather food and find some water.”
 AFP Commander, Glen McEwen, admitted that he was very skeptical when he had received the first reports concerning a feral child near Broken Hill.
  “I really thought it was a hoax,”
 he told reporters.
  “In fact, I had doubts until I saw the boy myself.”
 The boy is apparently aged between 4 and 6 years old, and seems surprisingly healthy considering the fact that he was living with animals. He suffers obvious signs of malnutrition, as well as severe sunburns, but he seems to have developed normally and to be in rather good shape.
 A complete medical examination will, however, be necessary to determine precisely his physical and mental condition.
 The boy doesn’t seem able to understand any human language and is visibly scared of other humans, suggesting he could have been living in the wild for many years.
 He is terribly scared of other human beings and tends to react violently when approached, so his rehabilitation is expected to be a long and difficult process.
 The Australian Federal Police launched an investigation to determine the identity of the child and the circumstances of his disappearance.
 They are asking anyone who could possess information which could be useful in the case, to contact the AFP as soon as possible.
 So many opinions, many that should be kept to ones self, but here’s mine. He defiantly looks aboriginal, so their may be no way to find the parents, or what the circumstances were. Yes, the kangaroos are his adopted family, and the little guy is sure a survivor, but I don’t think he should be left to survive in those harsh elements. I think they should find a tribe that will take him in and let them tend to his nourishment and care, rather then him being poked and prodded and studies.

 “The boy is extremely nervous and aggressive when approached by humans. This made his capture quite complicated, especially since the kangaroos defended him viciously. We had to “tranquilize” three of the adult marsupials using darts filled with sedatives before we could lay our hands on the child. We really went to great lengths to make sure we did not injure him during the operation. Fortunately, the capture was a great success and the boy is unharmed

 “The boy seems to have adopted most of the habits of the other kangaroos,”

", Indonesia: Zoo Keeper Accused of Impregnating Female Orangutan," The 38-year-old zoo keeper was filmed in full action by a series of hidden cameras put in place by the zoo’s security officials after doubts emerged about the man’s devious actions towards the zoo animals.
 “Some animals seemed sexually aroused when it was time to feed them” explains Akhiroel Yahya, employee of the zoo for 14 years.
 “But what made us most suspicious was when we discovered Marylin, our oldest orangutan, was pregnant. She has never been in contact with any other orangutans because of her aggressive nature, so it didn’t make any sense” he acknowledges, visibly troubled by the news.
 The Surabaya zoo authorities became highly suspicious when Marylin, the zoo’s eldest female orangutan, was found pregnant three months ago
 The zoo officials admit it took them sometime before being able to explain what had actually happened.
 “At first, we clearly did not comprehend what had happened,” admits the zoo’s director, Abdoel Hakim. “Marilyn has been secluded for the past 10 years, it was a total mystery,” he acknowledges.
 “It is only when we placed several hidden cameras that we learned the horrible truth” he admits, visibly angered by the whole situation.
 When confronted by local authorities, the offender denied any wrong doing on his part.
 “He said everything he had done was consensual,” explains police chief Abubakar Jaar. “He said he loved each and everyone of the animals and was very sorry he had impregnated the orangutan,” he told local reporters.
 “He says he did not know orangutans could get pregnant from humans,” he added.
 If many experts believe the man could not have impregnated the female orangutan, some specialists claim a rare genetic predisposition could explain the unexplainable.
 Paleobiologist Bachtiar Pado Panghulu of the University of Jakarta claims orangutan DNA is extremely close to human DNA
 “Contrary to popular belief, the orangutan species is much closer to the human species than chimpanzees. We share practically the same DNA code, with only minute differences, which could explain the orangutan falling pregnant from this man” explains Paleobiologist Bachtiar Pado Panghulu, of the University of Jakarta.
 “Particularly in Indonesia, the genetic profile of some of the population is extremely close to the orangutan species, leading us to believe they’re might have been a common ancestor to both species only a few hundred thousand years ago,” he admits.
 Surabaya zoo, Indonesia’s largest zoo, repeatedly made headlines in 2012 because of its scandalous treatment of its animals after
  a former employee of the zoo claimed that over 50 animals had died at the zoo during the three months since he had been hired.
 Any hole will do

", Drunk school principal defecates in front of students during pledge of allegiance," Andrew Whitmore, 53, was visibly under the influence of alcohol when he decided to throw down his pants and defecate on the schoolyard in front of bewildered students and school personnel.
 Whitmore also embarrassed himself even more after losing his balance and falling to the ground in his own pile of feces before eventually being carried away by local police officers.
  “He started yelling something about Trump being a racist pig and a fascist cunt or something,” one student told local reporters.
 Franklin Middle School secretary, Hillary Johnson, says she was shocked by the behavior of the principal and had never seen him this mad
 Whitmore later admitted to police officers that he had spent his night drinking and smoking crystal meth.
 “He said the situation with Donald Trump and the national anthem had really pissed him off and that he didn’t remember doing the things he had done,” Deputy Sheriff Tom Hannity told local reporters.
 “He allegedly had a blackout and does not remember defecating in front of the whole school,” he explained.
 Whitmore was arrested on charges of public intoxication and faces six counts of obscenity and could face up to 18 months in jail believe legal experts.
 We all make mistakes. He was drunk and didn’t use his best judgement. We’ve all been there, right? Hopefully he learned from this incident and doesn’t get in too much trouble or lose his job over it. I’m sure he’s so embarrassed that he will make sure it will never happen again.

 “He dropped down his pants and everybody was shocked, but then he started to crap on the grass, fell down and started puking all over himself. It was truly disturbing,” said another student, visibly disgusted.

 Mr. Whitmore made local headlines last June when he uploaded a faceless video of himself masturbating on Facebook at 3 am, telling President Donald Trump to “suck on his cock” before taking down the video hours later, claiming his account had been hacked.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/sperm-bank-nurse-falls-pregnant-after-smuggling-semen-in-her-vagina/
", Sperm bank nurse falls pregnant after smuggling semen in her vagina," 29-year old Jessica Jensen was arrested this morning by the Fairfax City Police Department after an investigation revealed she was implicated in an illegal sperm smuggling ring.
 The young worked in the Sample Collection Department of the Fairfax Cryobank, the largest fertility clinic in Virginia.
 She’s accused of using her position to steal semen samples which were then sold on the black market by an accomplice.
 According to the Fairfax police chief, Captain Harold Pardini, Ms. Jensen is actually 4-months pregnant after one of the vials broke while hidden in her vaginal cavity.
 According to Captain Pardini, the accused fell pregnant from those samples but kept smuggling sperm despite her pregnancy, until her accomplice was caught selling stolen semen to an undercover police officer.
 According to the Fairfax County Police chief, Captain Harold Pardini, this was probably the most active “illegal sperm ring” in the history of the country. He estimates the total profit of their crimes to over $25 million.
 Ms. Jensen now faces a total of 83 criminal charges and a maximum of 435 years in prison.
 Her accomplice, 47-year old Michael Donovan is also facing 67 accusations in a separate trial and could end up in jail for a maximum of 315 years.
 Both of them have decided to plead “not guilty”, and their trials are expected to begin in March.
 Jessica Jensen also confirmed she had decided to go on with the pregnancy and is expected to give birth in June.

  “She admitted that she had smuggled over 2,500 sperm samples over the last year, and that two of the vials broke during one of her smuggling operations.”
 

 
  “She was clearly addicted to the money it brought her. We think that she gained more than $2 millions from her crimes.”

", Teenager Who Turned Blind After Over-Masturbating Warns ‘It Ain’t Worth It!’," The 17-year-old man who has been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) admits he could masturbate over 36 times a day before losing his eyesight.
 – Josh Turnip
 Frequent masturbation can accelerate age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, the most common cause of blindness in the Western World, explains Dr. Andrew Kramer at St. Luke’s Medical Center
 Although Josh Turnip knows most teens don’t indulge in masturbating as much as he did, he admits he hopes others will heed his warnings.
 “I started to have blurry vision, sometimes I would even pass out completely” he recalls, visibly emotional. “My doctors thought I had epileptic seizures. It is only when I turned almost completely blind that we realized what was the true cause of my fading eyesight,” he adds.
 “I just hope that by telling my story to the world I can prevent this from happening to other teens who think masturbating comes with no consequences,” he concludes.
 Doctors believe Josh’s condition could improve in the months to come and have noticed a slow recovery of visual functions since he has changed his habits.
 too much cums inside the eyes will do that to u little boy
 Every day I beat my dick like it owed me money. But I only do it ONCE because I do it RIGHT!
 What a jerk. He’s lucky he didn’t have a stroke.
 I see what you did there.
 Y’all some dumb motherfuckers!
 Bwahahahaha
 He did not masturbate correctly!!! When I do – I do it with both hands. And sometimes up to 52 times a day.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/national-geographic-cameraman-arrested-for-raping-a-zebra/
", National Geographic cameraman arrested for raping a zebra," Mr Fitzgerald was shooting a documentary film on Burchell’s zebras along with two other National Geographic employees and five local guides, when he left the group to “get a closer look” of the animals.
 A few minutes later, his colleagues went looking for him and found him engaging in sexual intercourse with one of the animals.
 According to the South African Police Service (SAPS), 32-year old Brian Fitzgerald, from Morristown in New Jersey, lured a young male zebra with pieces of fruits before tying it down with a rope and sodomizing it.
 There is no specific legislation against bestiality in South Africa, but due to the circumstances, Mr Fitzgerald is accused of violating the Animals Protection Act, which makes it an offense to ill-treat, torture or terrify an animal.
 If found guilty, he faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison.
 The South African National Police Commissioner, Lt. Gen. Khomotso Phahlane, says charges were filed because the animal “obviously didn’t consent” to engage in sexual intercourse.
 The Executive director of the National Council of Societies for the Protection of Animals (NSPCA), Marcelle Meredith, says she wasn’t surprised when she learned about Mr Fitzgerald’s case.
 She claims that South Africa has become a popular destination for zoophiles over the last few years, despite the authorities’ efforts to crack down on the phenomenon.
 In recent years there have been the cases of a Transkei man sentenced to 12 months’ jail for having sex with a sheep; some Grahamstown youths caught “gang raping” a dog; and a 23-year-old Free State farm worker arrested when he was spotted by passing motorists while standing on a dunghill with his trousers around his knees, having intercourse with a cow.
 Despite the increasing number of accusations, the NSPCA estimates that more than 20,000 animals have been sexually abused in the country over the last two years.
 Utterly repulsive humans raping animals poor zebra probably caught an STD from the bile diseased camera guy!
 Such characters should be given a psych eval and if found same should be castrated and then tortured to death. Poor animals can’t speak or protest. Sad.

 “Witnesses have seen him binding the animal to restrain its movements, attaching it to his jeep and then raping it,”


 . “If the allegations are true and he did tie up the zebra, then the animal clearly didn’t give its consent.”

"," Retirement home raided by the FBI for running elderly fight club, 7 arrests"," According to investigators, the 124 residents of the Retirement Village were forced to fight each other in order to obtain basic things such as food and medical treatments.
 The fights were filmed and relayed online on a specialized website, where they often attracted several thousand viewers and astounding amounts of money in bets.
 FBI spokesman, Bill Donovan, says the most popular fights were the ones in which contenders were “armed” with canes or walkers.
 Officer Donovan says the staff used several different methods to force the residents to fight, either by through rewards or punishment.
 According to the FBI, the organizers of this illegal combat ring may have pocketed over $125 million over the 3 years it was in operation, mostly from online bets.
 The FBI confirmed it has seized a lot of computer hardware in the Retirement Village as well as several other pieces of evidence like video cameras blood-covered walkers.
 The two owners of the retirement home and five other employees were arrested for the role they played in the organization.
 The five employees each face numerous criminal charges and could face sentences going from 45 to 85 years in jail if found guilty on all charges.
 The owners of the retirement home, Terence and Michelle Aniston, respectively face 37 and 31 accusations and could face over 300 years in prison.
 Their trial is expected to begin at the end of June and should draw a lot of media attention.
 I love the idea of this fight club! these old pricks have nothing to live for so why not make them entertain us keep it up!!

  “The older and more handicapped the fighters were, the larger was the crowd the fight attracted. Some were so weak they used mobility scooters to try and roll on each other.”
 

 “The nursing home’s staff forced the elders to beat each other up very badly, offering ridiculous rewards such as Jell-O or extra mashed potatoes. Some residents who refused to fight had their dentures or glasses confiscated until they complied.”

", Midget stuck 3 days in mailbox after falling in while mailing letter," 49-year old Walter Morrison, from Fayetteville in North Carolina, was found on Monday morning by a postal employee collecting the mail.
 The 3’10” tall man was unconscious and severely dehydrated, so he was rapidly transported to the nearby Cape Fear Valley Medical Center where he was admitted in a critical condition.
 Thomas Dunsmore, the mailman who found Mr. Morrison, described the scene in an interview with MSNBC.
 He had just finished extracting the poor man from the narrow container when the paramedics arrived a few minutes later.
 Tom Dunmore,  who saved Mr. Morrison’s life, told MSNBC that he’d found many strange things in mailboxes over his 30-year career, but this was “by far the most disturbing”.
 Fortunately, the medical staff was able to stabilize Mr. Morrison after a few hours of intensive care, and he regained consciousness the next morning.
 According to doctors, he broke his left thumb and his right foot, but should suffer no long-term physical consequences from his misadventure.
 Mr. Morrison says he fell in in the box on Friday morning while attempting to mail a letter and was unable to get out.
 He claims the accident was in part due to the fact that the mailbox was almost 40 years old and wasn’t as safe as the new ones.
 In fact, some employees of the U.S. postal services replaced it only hours later be a new one, suggesting this claim may be at least partially true.
 Walter Morrison says he’s considering filing a lawsuit against the U.S.P.S. but first wants to take time to recover from his ordeal.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/china-miner-found-alive-after-17-years-underground/
", China: Miner Found Alive After 17 Years Underground," While they were exploring the galleries, they stumbled upon Cheung Wai, a 59-year-old survivor from the 2001 accident, obviously in a rather bad shape.
 Wai was immediately taken to the hospital where a complete evaluation of his physical and mental states will be done over the next weeks.
 The poor man had remained trapped underground with the bodies of 78 of his dead coworkers after an earthquake of a magnitude of 7,8 hit the region and caused the wooden support structure of the mine to crumble and collapse.
 Wai managed to survive thanks to an emergency stash of rice and water, stored in an underground depot, conceived especially for this kind of case.
 Even though Wai was suffering from great physical and mental stress, he managed to give proper burials to all of his comrades, spending almost a year in this great selfless act.
 Mining accidents remain common in China, despite growing measures by the government to reduce the problem, which killed more than 4000 miners a year at the beginning of the millennium.
 Over the last years, the authorities have been cracking down on many unregulated mining operations which account for almost 80 percent of the country’s 16,000 mines.
 The closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped to cut in half the average number of miners killed, to about six a day, in the first months of this year, according to government statistics.
 The former record for surviving underground was of 142 days and was held by a British man named Geoff Smith. He had been voluntarily buried in the backyard of the
  Railway Inn
 , his favorite pub, with the intention of breaking the record.

 Somehow lucky in his misfortune, Mr. Cheung was saved by the fact that a ventilation duct still connected his underground prison to the surface, allowing him access to air that was sufficiently pure to keep him alive.

 The man


 his diet by catching and eating the countless rats that pullulate in the mine, as well as collecting large quantities of some sort of phosphorescent moss, which constituted his only source of vitamins.

 The case of Mr. Cheung remains unique, however, and constitutes a world record, according to the universally recognized authority on record-breaking achievement, Guinness.

", Man accused of ejaculating in his boss’ coffee everyday for 4 years," 38-year old Lewis Williams spent the last four years working as the personal assistant of Ms. Linda Moore, executive president of the DANCO engineering firm.
 Among his tasks as Ms. Moore’s assistant, he was to take her phone calls, set her schedule and bring her a cup of coffee to her desk every day when she arrived at work.
 After a dispute with his boss this morning, Mr. Williams admitted in front of a dozen coworkers, that he had ejaculated in her coffee “hundreds of time”.
 According to Brian Little, an intern who witnessed the entire scene, Lewis Williams showed no remorse while he confessed his crime.
 The angry employee explained that he had been putting “extra cream” in Ms. Moore’s coffee,  five days a week and over many years.
 After his confession, his colleagues called the police and Mr. Williams was arrested on the site.
 A total of 910 criminal charges has been filed against him, including 860 charges of sexual assault. If found guilty on all charges, he could face up to 1070 years in prison.
 Newark Police Chief Barry Connell says the accused confessed more than 800 crimes, making him the most prolific sexual offender in American history.
 Lewis William’s motivations when he committed his crimes remain unclear, but there certainly was some animosity between him and his boss.
 Some of his colleagues have told reporters that he was deeply misogynic and found it humiliating to take orders from a woman all day.
 Some other employees, however, have suggested that Ms. Moore was often “aggressive, dominating and verbally abusive” with the accused and he may have acted as some sort of “self-defense”.
 He must have enjoyed the flavor for it to last that long

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/saudi-prince-loses-350-millions-and-5-of-his-wives-in-6-hours-at-the-casino/
", Saudi Prince loses $350 millions and 5 of his wives in 6 hours at the casino," Prince Majed bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is well-known around the world for both his drug and gambling habits, but his latest betting frenzy is quite exceptional even for him.
 Spending the week at the renowned Sinai Grand Casino, the Prince spent six hours at the “unlimited stakes” poker table and had an incredible losing streak.
 In one evening, he lost hundreds of millions of dollars and was even forced to give up five of his spouses to cover part of his debt.
 According to the director of the casino, Ali Shamoon, the prince pawned his wives in exchange for $25M in credit and left them there after he lost.
 Pawning or selling women is rather rare practice but it is still legal in several Middle Eastern countries.
 The high profile of these particular women appears to embarrass both the Sinai Grand Casino and the Egyptian government, however, and a diplomatic solution remains quite probable.
 It is still unclear what will happen to the Prince’s wives and if they will be able to return to Saudi Arabia, and most experts believe that other members of the Saudi Royal family could buy them back discretely over the next few weeks.
 If not, they will likely be sold at auction in a few months, probably in Yemen or Qatar.
 Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said his government would do everything it could to facilitate the Saudi women’s return to their homeland, as soon as their husband’s debt will be paid.
 This isn’t the first time that Prince Majed bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud attracts attention for bad reasons.
 In 2015, the Saudi Arabian prince was accused of a having sexual relationship with a male aide, taking cocaine and threatening to kill women who refused his advances – as well as sexually assaulting a maid.
 A few days after the facts were revealed by the media, Los Angeles County prosecutors announced that they would not be filing charges against the prince and he was allowed to leave the country.
 This time, however, the prince is believed to have lost the vast majority of his fortune, so he may finally calm down and adopt a more conservative lifestyle.
 Some people must live in Luxury and comfort but others live in poverty but still happy. Riches or wealth does not equate to happiness or peace. God created some to live in that manner, however, not everyone is meant to live that way. Therefore Enjoy whatever little you have and remember your creator.

 “We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before we finally shot it and wounded it to the head” explains the Toronto resident on vacation.
 “Luckily, I had my rifle in hand, or else this prize fish would’ve never been caught” claims his friend, a long-time resident of Chicago, Allan Brooks.
 John O’Keefe, a Canadian tourist and Toronto resident, captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake yesterday
 The great white shark estimated at more than 1,5 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.
 “Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region, but this is clearly the first occurrence of such a beast in the region that I can remember of” he admits, visibly puzzled.
 “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.
 Authorities suspect that more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.
 Local campground owner, Robert Helm, says he had warned authorities about the series of disappearances to no avail
 “I’ve owned this campground for the past seventeen years” explains local entrepreneur, Robert Helm.
 “I’ve had my load of visitors disappearing mysteriously over the years, but I was told not to say anything about it. People would check in, but they wouldn’t check out,” he recalls. “Nobody ever believed me anyway and it would’ve scared away the tourists,” he told local reporters.
 “It would’ve been bad for business in town” he adds, visibly relieved since the capture of the large creature.
 U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Sidney Johnson reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems, dealing great damage to their kidneys and respiratory system.
 In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Erie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.

 Several locals came to the rescue of Anthony Sanders, 47, who apparently crashed his car into the river while attempting to perform oral sex on himself, according to officials.
 Sanders told officers he had an uncontrollable urge for a “blowjob” moments before the accident occurred.
 Anthony Sanders was immediately brought to the Trident Medical Center where he was found to suffer from several broken ribs and deep lacerations to the back of his mouth and throat, say doctors.
 Anthony Sanders faces accusations of driving under the influence as well as 16 different accounts of reckless driving and could face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty according to South Carolina state laws.

 “He had his head stuck under the steering wheel with his genitals inside his mouth. I don’t understand how he got into that position,” Adam Simmons, one of his rescuers, told reporters.

 “The driver was heavily intoxicated under several substances and was attempting to perform oral sex on himself while driving, which is by itself a blatantly dangerous maneuver,” explained Deputy Sheriff, Robert Kilsh.

", Gang member dies in prison after smuggling M-16 in his anus," The man that is believed to be part of the notorious El Salvador-based MS-13 crime organization, also known as Mara Salvatrucha, has died from internal bleeding after he told the medical staff at the California State Prison of Los Angeles County (LAC) he had tried to smuggle the barrel of an M-16 inside his rectum.
 Sixteen other suspects have been apprehended within the prison walls after the convicted criminal gave the names of other convicts who had sneaked in different gun parts inside the vicinity of the compound and several other gun parts have since been seized by prison officials.
 The barrel of the M-16 perforated Garcia’s intestinal track which led to internal bleeding and resulted in the death of the prisoner hours after he was admitted inside the California State Prison of Los Angeles County (LAC) states the coroner report.
 Rafael Raza Garcia, 23, was arrested this week on drug charges and admitted to officials it was a common ploy to get purposefully arrested to smuggle drugs and weapons into the prison.
 Rafael Raza Garcia, who had crossed the Mexican border illegally in 1998, was granted temporary legal status and a work permit under the Obama administration in 2014 as were nearly 5 million other illegal immigrants at the time.
 Why didn’t he try a 10″ or 8″ barrel….vato went with the 16″….guess he didn’t want to break the law and make a SBR without the proper paperwork and tax stamp….

  “He fell on his knees and started crying, saying he would snitch on anyone who was part of the smuggling operation if we could save his life,” a prison guard told reporters.
 

 
  “Drugs and weapons smuggled inside maximum security facilities fetch high prices and can help gang members climb the ladders within a criminal organization” explains Antonio Fox, California State prison spokesman.

"https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/man-turns-himself-in-to-the-fbi-for-killing-abraham-lincoln-in-1865/
", Man turns himself in to the FBI for killing Abraham Lincoln in 1865," 71-year-old Leroy Timothy Anderson, claims he worked for 35 years as a “time-traveling assassin” for a secret governmental agency and says he has killed people at various times, going from 1678 to 2239.
 The elderly man declared that his actions were all legitimate and ordered by the government, but that he fears his former employers might want to eliminate him because he knows too much.
 He claims that he was part a program called the Chronos Project, which was designed, coordinated, and executed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States special operations forces, under the supervision of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
 This ultra-secret program would have orchestrated more than 1200 assassinations, spreading out over almost all of human history, including many famous characters like Martin Luther King Jr, Julius Cesar or Mahatma Gandhi.
 “His story was clearly one of the most entertaining that I have ever heard,” said FBI director, Christopher A. Wray.
 “I know that conspiracy theorists will accuse us of covering up Lincoln’s murder and stuff like that, but the FBI isn’t going to open an investigation. I don’t think this man killed anyone, I think he just lost contact with reality.”
 According to the FBI, Mr. Anderson was previously diagnosed with dissociative disorder and schizophrenia, problems which could explain his strange confession.
 Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while attending the play
  Our American Cousin
 at Ford’s Theatre, in Washington, D.C.  as the American Civil War was drawing to a close.
 The assassination is generally believed to have been planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth, as part of a larger conspiracy in a bid to revive the Confederate cause.
 Mr. Booth was shot and killed by Union soldiers while hiding on a farm in Virginia, only days after the crime. Eight other conspirators or suspects were tried and convicted, and four were hanged shortly thereafter.
 Why, just why, please tell me why god dammit, WHY?!
 I’m a sick fuck I like a quick fuck
 Good man to bad he didn’t kill him 4 years sooner. 1 million people would not of been killed over him being money hungry. Stealing it from the South

 “Mr. Anderson not only claims to have killed President Lincoln but also 32 others, including at least twelve that are not even born yet,” Wray told reporters.
