Pushed Over Edge by Anniversary of Mom's FuneralPushed Over Edge by Anniversary of Mom's FuneralKanye West just snapped a week ago Monday in what we're told was a \"nervous breakdown\" ... triggered in large part by the anniversary of his mother's death.Sources very close to Kanye tell TMZ ... he was increasingly becoming a powder keg of emotions in the weeks leading up to his hospitalization at the UCLA Medical Center ... fueled by what we're told was a shocking lack of sleep and the pressures of touring, running his businesses, parenting and providing emotional support to his wife who was suffering her own emotional trauma after the Paris robbery.But our sources say the trigger for the breakdown was Donda's death back in November 2007.",
