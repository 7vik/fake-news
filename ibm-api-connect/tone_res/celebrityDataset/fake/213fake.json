      "text": "Iggy Azalea and Odell Beckham Jr.: Dating!You might be surprised by the news that Odell Beckham Jr. and Iggy Azalea are dating, but if you stop and think about it for a moment, they actually make perfect sense as a couple.For one thing, Odell is famous for his one-handed catch, and Iggy is a famous one-hit wonder.Beckham is forever frustrating defensive backs with his incredible talent, while Azalea frustrates her peers by being an offensive hack with an appalling lack of talent.The list goes on and on:Odell is a wide receiver, and Iggy receives widespread criticism for being awful.Beckham runs hot routes and catches passes, while Azalea received a pass for being a terrible rapper because she's hot.You get the idea.Anyway, according to Us Weekly, Beckham and Azalea have finally started admitting that they're a couple.Rumors that Odell and Iggy are dating first started circulating back in May, but both parties denied they'd been hooking up.\u201cI literally don\u2019t even know Odell Beckham.",
