      "text": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Come Out As an Item, After 'Tom Cruise Ban' ExpiresNow here\u2019s something to really jump up and down on the couch for.Hollywood\u2019s worst-kept romantic secret\u2014the relationship between Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes\u2014is finally out of the bag, after the couple was photographed walking hand in hand on the beach in Malibu on Labor Day, wearing matching fedoras no less.They have repeatedly denied they are in a relationship over the past few years, despite incessant rumors and frequent sightings of them together.Indeed, on one occasion, a friend of the couple, apparently unaware of the omerta, accidentally mentioned their relationship to media outlets, only to issue a hasty retraction.The absurd level of secrecy, and their public appearance together this week, looks set to give credence to an extraordinary rumor first reported by the gossip site RadarOnline.In September last year,&nbsp;Radar&nbsp;claimed that as part of her divorce settlement from Top Gun star Cruise, Holmes had agreed not to publicly date anyone until five years had passed following the end of her marriage.\u201cKatie",
